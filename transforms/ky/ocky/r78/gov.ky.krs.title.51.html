       <span class="boldspan"></span>
    KRS Chapters 600 to 645 shall be interpreted to effectuate the following express legislative purposes:
   <ol class="alpha" type="a"><li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12a">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    The Commonwealth shall direct its efforts to promoting protection of children; to the strengthening and encouragement of family life for the protection and care of children; to strengthening and maintaining the biological family unit; to ensuring that policies and practices utilized are supported by data and research and are monitored or measured for their effectiveness in achieving the intended results; and to offering all available resources to any family in need of them;
   <li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12b">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    It also shall be declared to be the policy of this Commonwealth that:
   <ol><li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12b1">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    All efforts shall be directed toward providing each child a safe and nurturing home;
   <li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12b2">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    Emphasis shall be placed on involving families in interventions developed for youth, providing families with access to services necessary to address issues within the family, and increasing accountability of the youth and families within the juvenile justice system;
   <li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12b3">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    To the extent possible, out-of-home placement should only be utilized for youth who are high-risk or high-level offenders, and that low-risk, low-level offenders should be served through evidence-based programming in their community; and
   <li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12b4">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    As the population in Department of Juvenile Justice facilities is reduced through increased use of community-based treatment, and if staffing ratios can be maintained at the levels required by accreditation bodies, reductions of the number of facilities should be considered;
   </ol><li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12c">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    The court shall show that other less restrictive alternatives have been attempted or are not feasible in order to insure that children are not removed from families except when absolutely necessary;
   <li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12d">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    Any child brought before the court under KRS Chapters 600 to 645 shall have a right to treatment reasonably calculated, through the use of evidence-based programs when available, to bring about an improvement of his or her condition and, to the extent possible, have that treatment administered in the county of residence of the custodial parent or parents or in the nearest available county;
   <li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12e">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635" target="_self">Chapter 635</a></cite> shall be interpreted to promote the best interests of the child through providing treatment and sanctions to reduce recidivism and assist in making the child a productive citizen by involving the family, as appropriate, and by advancing the principles of personal responsibility, accountability, and reformation, while maintaining public safety, and seeking restitution and reparation;
   <li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12f">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc640" target="_self">Chapter 640</a></cite> shall be interpreted to promote public safety and the concept that every child be held accountable for his or her conduct through the use of restitution, reparation, and sanctions, in an effort to rehabilitate delinquent youth; and
   <li class="p6" id="tLIc600s600.010ol12g">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    It shall further be the policy of this Commonwealth to provide judicial procedures in which rights and interests of all parties, including the parents and victims, are recognized and all parties are assured prompt and fair hearings. Unless otherwise provided, such protections belong to the child individually and may not be waived by any other party.

        Common law infancy defense does not apply to proceedings under the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code. W.D.B. v. Commonwealth, 2006<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS346" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 346</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1108 (Ky. Ct.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code has extinguished the common law presumption that a child is without criminal capacity (the “infancy defense”), since a delinquency adjudication in juvenile court is not a criminal conviction under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.040" target="_self">635.040</a></cite>, and allowing the presumption would frustrate the clinical and rehabilitative purposes of the Code. W.D.B. v. Commonwealth, 246 S.W.3d 448, 2007<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS241" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 241</a></cite> (Ky. 2007).

       <p>
        The intent of subsection (1) in giving the District Court the ability to review any information it may require regarding one of its orders is to safeguard the interests of the child, considering it welfare as being too precious a commodity to jeopardize by an incomplete or inadequate judicial review. Cabinet for Human Resources v. McDonald, 765 S.W.2d 581, 1988<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS175" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 175</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In line with the legislature’s expression in this section of the public policy to strengthen families in order to protect and care for children, children have a common-law right of action for the loss of parental consortium. Giuliani v. Guiler, 951 S.W.2d 318, 1997<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS74" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 74</a></cite> (Ky. 1997).

        Juvenile may voluntarily waive the preliminary hearing required under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc640s640.010ol12" target="_self">640.010(2)</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol12" target="_self">635.020(2)</a></cite> before the juvenile’s case may be transferred to the circuit court as: (1) KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.010ol12e" target="_self">600.010(2)(e)</a></cite> signals the legislature’s intent to allow a juvenile to waive any of the rights set out in the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code, (2) the preliminary hearing is a dispositional, rather than an adjudicatory hearing, (3) if a defendant can waive his constitutional right to a jury trial, there is no reason he cannot also waive his right to a preliminary hearing, and (4) the circuit court has general subject matter jurisdiction over juvenile felony matters. Humphrey v. Commonwealth, 153 S.W.3d 854, 2004<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS147" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 147</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).

        Since KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.060ol14" target="_self">635.060(4)</a></cite>, (5), restrict the dispositional option to a child 14 or older, and thus, any child under the age of 14 is not allowed to be placed in detention, the dispositional order imposing 15 days in detention for a 13-year-old juvenile was improper, despite the fact that the detention was probated. N.T.G. v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 218, 2006<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS51" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 51</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).

        The Commonwealth’s position that from evidence proving dependency, or abuse or neglect, of one child, the same condition may be inferred about another child who lives in the same household, ran against the grain of not only the Juvenile Code, but also the notion of constitutional due process of law and familial realities as well.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the lower court did not state that other less restrictive alternatives, such as probation, had been attempted or were not feasible in accordance with KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.010ol12c" target="_self">600.010(2)(c)</a></cite>, a juvenile defendant’s commitment to the department of justice was erroneous. X.B. v. Commonwealth, 105 S.W.3d 459, 2003<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS81" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 81</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a juvenile proceeding in which the juvenile argued that the trial court erred because commitment was not the least restrictive alternative since an aunt was willing to take her and that the trial court should have made findings as to why commitment was the only option, the trial court’s failure to make written findings or state during the hearings what alternatives had been tried was not fatal to the commitment. The record was full of second chances, house confinement, foster care, and other alternatives that the Cabinet for Families and Children and the court tried in order to help the juvenile. K.F. v. Commonwealth, 274 S.W.3d 457, 2008<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS376" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 376</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commitment of the juvenile was necessary to protect him from physical injury, and to the extent less restrictive alternatives were available, they were considered by the family court and determined unfeasible, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.010ol12c" target="_self">600.010(2)(c)</a></cite>,<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020" target="_self">600.020(</a></cite>35). J.S. v. Commonwealth, 304 S.W.3d 67, 2009<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS216" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 216</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court fully explored alternatives to commitment for defendant juvenile when it recognized that he had made progress in his foster home and that he had to be committed to the Kentucky Cabinet of Health and Family Services in order to remain there. At defendant’s arraignment, the Cabinet explained that it had attempted to involve the family in a diversion program, and the court had subsequently allowed defendant to live with his father and then a relative, both of which arrangements ended unsuccessfully. D.G. v. Commonwealth, 355 S.W.3d 476, 2011<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS228" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 228</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).

        Juvenile court retained jurisdiction over an offender to enforce a restitution order entered by the juvenile court after the offender turned 18 because KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.060" target="_self">600.060</a></cite> authorized the use of contempt powers to enforce the restitution order.

        Circuit court finding that a father neglected or abused his minor child because the father completed the case plan to the satisfaction of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, there was no allegation that the father ever engaged in any neglectful act directed toward the child, merely that his substance abuse in the past put the newborn child at risk of physical harm, and even more troubling was the disparate treatment received by the mother—against whom the Cabinet moved to dismiss the allegations—in spite of the fact that she had placed the child in actual, physical harm by substance abuse while pregnant with the child.

       <p>
        In a juvenile proceeding in which the juvenile argued that the trial court erred because commitment was not the least restrictive alternative since an aunt was willing to take her and that the trial court should have made findings as to why commitment was the only option, the trial court’s failure to make written findings or state during the hearings what alternatives had been tried was not fatal to the commitment. The record was full of second chances, house confinement, foster care, and other alternatives that the Cabinet for Families and Children and the court tried in order to help the juvenile. K.F. v.

        Commitment of the juvenile was necessary to protect him from physical injury, and to the extent less restrictive alternatives were available, they were considered by the family court and determined unfeasible, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.010ol12c" target="_self">600.010(2)(c)</a></cite>,<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020" target="_self">600.020(</a></cite>35).

        Order terminating a father’s parental rights was affirmed where, inter alia, father had no contact with the child for several years, and provided no financial support for 31 months; while the father claimed he did not know where to send support payments, the parties’ agreement included the proper address.

       <p>
        Evidence that the residences parents and children lived in were unsanitary and unsafe for human habitation, and that the older child had been sexually abused by his uncles and parents, was sufficient to establish that the children were abused and neglected as defined in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020ol11" target="_self">600.020(1)</a></cite> and to support the family court’s termination order. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs. v. A.G.G., 190 S.W.3d 338, 2006<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS97" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 97</a></cite> (Ky. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pre-trial order excluding evidence of sexual abuse on one of the child’s siblings that resulted in the removal of the siblings from the home was vacated as the disputed evidence was not barred under the doctrine of issue preclusion since the identity of the perpetrator was not established in a prior proceeding; the identity of the perpetrator was not material to the finding that the siblings were abused or neglected since KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020ol11" target="_self">600.020(1)</a></cite> required only a finding that a parent or guardian had created or allowed to be created a risk that the child would be the victim of sexual abuse or exploitation. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs. v. R.H., 199 S.W.3d 201, 2006<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS259" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 259</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was no substantial evidence to support a finding under either KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090ol11a" target="_self">625.090(1)(a)</a></cite>1. or (a)2., and there was no allegation of criminal charges under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090ol11a" target="_self">625.090(1)(a)</a></cite>3., the family court erred in finding that a child was abused or neglected; thus, as there was no ground supporting termination, the family court abused its discretion in terminating a mother’s parental rights to her daughter. T.G. v. Commonwealth, 2007<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS158" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 158</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 816 (Ky. Ct.

       <p>
        Cabinet for Health and Family Services did not present substantial evidence that a parent’s children were abused and neglected as required under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020ol11" target="_self">600.020(1)</a></cite>. It was not shown that the children suffered any direct, emotional or physical injury from the parent, and the Cabinet witnesses testified that the parent was a nurturing parent and that the children were well-cared for by the parent. M.E.C. v. Commonwealth, 254 S.W.3d 846, 2008<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS158" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 158</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).

       <p>
        To find that KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.030" target="_self">620.030</a></cite> does not apply, there must be a finding that the act committed upon the child is not an act of sexual abuse. For purposes of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600" target="_self">Chapter 600</a></cite>, the definition of a neglected or abused child is set forth at KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020" target="_self">600.020</a></cite>. If sexual abuse has occurred, then the mandatory reporting requirement in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.030" target="_self">620.030</a></cite> would have required the teacher to report this incident and such mandatory reporting would result in this being considered a ministerial rather than a discretionary act which would preclude the teacher from claiming qualified official immunity.

        Finding that a child was abused or neglected under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020" target="_self">600.020</a></cite> was not supported by substantial evidence because a family court failed to determine the truth or falsity of all the allegations in a complaint under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.100" target="_self">620.100</a></cite>, and it relied upon information outside the record that was neither raised as an allegation in the complaint nor presented as evidence during a hearing; also, a dependency, neglect, or abuse adjudication hearing was not the appropriate forum for rehashing custody issues. Even though judicial notice of a prior case involving the mother and father could have been taken, the family court’s consideration of the evidence it heard in the earlier action was improper; moreover, there was no notice or opportunity to be heard relating to the taking of judicial notice.

        Under the plain language of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020ol11" target="_self">600.020(1)</a></cite>, the definition of an abused child is limited to a scenario in which his or her parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision inflicted or committed abuse, allowed abuse to be inflicted or committed, or created or allowed to be created a risk of abuse. As a result, the mandatory reporting requirement of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.030ol11" target="_self">620.030(1)</a></cite> does not apply when a child inappropriately touches another child unless a parent, guardian, or other person exercising custodial control or supervision allows such inappropriate touching to be committed or creates or allows such a risk of abuse.

        Informal adjustment requiring a juvenile to live with the juvenile's father in another state was improper because the informal adjustment, (1) in effect, changed custody without a hearing on the father's propriety as a custodian, and (2) did not provide for the child's possible inability to live with the father.

        Termination of a mother's parental rights was appropriate because a child was found to be abused and neglected based on the infliction of an emotional injury; the child suffered from Reactive Attachment Disorder, and the mother's mental illness made it incapable for her to care for the child. Moreover, the mother inflicted emotional injury to the child, failed to provide adequate parental care and supervision, and failed to provide the essentials of life for the child's overall well-being; termination was in the best interest of the child, reunification efforts were made, and the child's welfare would have improved if termination was ordered.

        Termination of a father's parental rights on the ground of abandonment was inappropriate because, although the father did not visit with and support the child after the child was placed in foster care, the failures by the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services denied the father an opportunity to maintain contact with the child and to work toward a court-approved case plan to regain custody. Furthermore, the oral parenting plan given to the father was so lacking in formality and detail that it did not constitute a plan.

        For a parent to neglect a child, he or she must intend to do so, and dependency is different than neglect, because while dependency may occur in circumstances similar to neglect, it lacks the requisite intent on the part of the parent; a child who suffers harm as a result of a parent’s intentional acts is neglected or abused, and in contrast, a child is dependent if the harm results from a parent’s unintentional acts, or from a cause unrelated to parental culpability. K.S. v. Commonwealth, 2018<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS224" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 224</a></cite> (Ky. Ct.

        Abused or neglected child means a child whose health or welfare is harmed or threatened with harm and some would interpret “threatened with harm” as implicating a risk of neglect; although this interpretation may be sound in some cases, it does not obviate the necessity of intent for neglect or abuse. K.S. v. Commonwealth, 2018<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS224" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 224</a></cite> (Ky. Ct.

        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was improper because the evidence did not show that the child was neglected; while a doctor stated that the mother’s limited intellect gave rise to a risk of neglect, that is not the same as neglect but rather indicates a child is dependent. The mother never had custody of the child, never neglected the child, and complied with her case plan, and while she had developmental disabilities, that alone was insufficient to render her behavior as neglectful. K.S. v. Commonwealth, 2018<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS224" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 224</a></cite> (Ky. Ct.

        Neglect finding was proper because a father did not have to exercise control or supervision over the child, as “exercising custodial control or supervision” modified “other person.”

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found children to be neglected and requiring in-home supervision because the father had a history of criminal convictions for sexually abusing his underage half-brother and failed to comply with conditions of probation; the dispositional order was not unreasonable because the father was convicted of sexually abusing an underage male family member, violated his probation, and was classified as a risk, albeit low, to reoffend.

       <p>
        Subsection (1)(a)(2) does not calibrate for the judiciary the tolerable degree of risk when considering a potential finding of neglect, and it is a matter for judicial discretion; if psychosexual assessment standards do not contain a category of “no risk” in evaluating an offender’s chances for reoffending, then a risk for reoffending necessarily exists, and that risk of reoffending surely must be taken into account considering the offender’s initial offenses and subsequent history.

        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper because the child was neglected as she was born with amphetamines in her system that came from the mother’s use of amphetamines prescribed to her, but she did not inform her physician of her pregnancy; she continuously abused drugs over the two-year period after the child had been removed; she went from one abusive relationship to another and did not complete her protective parenting class; and she did not pay child support; because there was no reasonable expectation of improvement in the mother’s situation within a reasonable amount of time; and because the child had been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months preceding the filing of the petition to terminate.

       A married child under the age of 16 has a legal responsibility to attend school, but once a child marries, the parent or guardian no longer has a legal obligation to ensure that the child attends school; however, if the spouse of a minor who is under the age of 16 and who is an habitual truant, is found to be a person exercising custodial control or supervision as defined by this section, the spouse may be subject to penalties under the Juvenile Code.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG87-40" target="_blank">OAG 87-40</a></cite>.

        Family court erred in imposing criminal contempt sanctions against the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services because the court held the Cabinet in contempt for having disregarded a procedural rule which the court itself acknowledged regularly disregarding and the court failed to find willful disobedience by a case worker in the failure to file a required report.

There shall be documentation that the social service worker, prior to the court hearing, made an effort to contact the parents to inform them of the specific problems that could lead to removal so they have an opportunity to take corrective action.

If the parents’ whereabouts are unknown, notice may be mailed to the last known address of an adult who is a near relative.

Within seventy-two (72) hours after the removal, the cabinet shall file a petition for review in District Court pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.120" target="_self">610.120</a></cite> with a request for an expeditious hearing.

The subject matter of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600" target="_self">Chapter 600</a></cite> relates to introductory matters of the Unified Juvenile Code, KRS Chapters 600 to 645. Since this statute specifically addresses the standard of judgment a caregiver of a committed child must exercise in allowing participation in age or developmentally appropriate activities, in codification the Reviser of Statutes created a new section of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc605" target="_self">Chapter 605</a></cite>, which addresses administrative matters pertaining to committed children, as a more appropriate statutory designation under the authority of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11a" target="_blank">7.136(1)(a)</a></cite>.

        Trial court had jurisdiction to enter custody orders as to a child who was originally presented to a hospital in Kentucky with life-threatening injuries, and who was transferred to a hospital in Tennessee, by air lift on that same date; however, an order permitting the Cabinet to terminate life sustaining treatment for the child was improper because the best interests of the child were secondary to the overriding and paramount right of the mother to a due process adjudication of termination. Until those rights were formally adjudicated, the Cabinet was not permitted to terminate treatment. D.K. v.

        The intent of this section in giving the District Court the ability to review any information it may require regarding one of its orders is to safeguard the interests of the child, considering its welfare as being too precious a commodity to jeopardize by an incomplete or inadequate judicial review. Cabinet for Human Resources v. McDonald, 765 S.W.2d 581, 1988<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS175" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 175</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).

A.W. v. Commonwealth, 2003<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS91" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 91</a></cite> (Ky. Ct.

        Juvenile court had the authority to hold a public offender in contempt for violating the terms of her probation, but the court should refrain from using its contempt authority to punish violations of probation unless it found that other options were either inappropriate or unavailable. A.W. v. Commonwealth, 2003<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS91" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 91</a></cite> (Ky. Ct.

        When a public offender was found in contempt for violating the terms of her probation, significant due process considerations came into play, and, while her counsel’s stipulation to a violation of probation was adequate to establish a violation, it could not serve as the basis for finding the offender guilty of contempt of court.

Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs. v. Evans, 2006<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS52" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 52</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2006 Ky. App. Unpub.

        Order modifying the amount of restitution that a juvenile was directed to pay was affirmed because KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.010ol113" target="_self">610.010(13)</a></cite> (now (14)) granted the juvenile court continuing jurisdiction to review a previously entered restitution order.

        The Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over and, therefore, properly dismissed a juvenile’s appeal from an order of an elected Circut Court judge sitting in Family Court which required the juvenile to cooperate in counseling, undergo a drug and alcohol screening, and to schedule a gynecological examination before the next hearing date; the juvenile should have taken her appeal to the Circuit Court pursuant to the Family Court rules of practice.

        Trial court had jurisdiction to enter custody orders as to a child who was originally presented to a hospital in Kentucky with life-threatening injuries, and who was transferred to a hospital in Tennessee by air lift on that same date; however, an order permitting the Cabinet to terminate life sustaining treatment for the child was improper because the best interests of the child were secondary to the overriding and paramount right of the mother to a due process adjudication of termination. Until those rights were formally adjudicated, the Cabinet was not permitted to terminate treatment. D.K. v.

        Firearm enhanced drug offense is actually charged at the higher level regardless of the procedural circumstances. Therefore, a circuit court properly acquired jurisdiction in a juvenile case because transfer order was facially valid where a district court found probable cause that appellant committed the offense of drug trafficking with a firearm enhancement; moreover, the trial court made two sets of findings, one concerning mandatory findings and one about the discretionary factors.

        Defendant juvenile was wrongly designated as a status offender after a family court found him in contempt because the court did not engage defendant in any sort of meaningful discussion concerning the consequences of his guilty plea, nor did it determine or assure whether he made it voluntarily. The court did not ask defendant about his state of mind or if anyone had pressured him to make the plea, it did not explain to defendant that he had the option of pleading not guilty and thus becoming entitled to a hearing, and it did not ascertain whether he was aware of the constitutional rights that he waived as a result of his admission.

The SSAO was entered after the minor was initially brought into court for her arraignment on the beyond control of parent charge and entered a plea of not true, she was made subject to the SSAO, and it regulated her future conduct.

        Court may only hold a child in contempt of court to enforce a valid court order previously issued by the court. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.010" target="_self">610.010(</a></cite>11). It is manifestly unjust to subject a juvenile to sanctions for contempt, especially confinement in a detention facility, when the status offense case against her was effectively terminated without the entry of a valid written order regulating her future conduct.

        Circuit court judge was ordered to provide members of the media with a copy of the recording of a criminal arraignment and to refrain from closing any future proceeding that was ordinarily open to the public and from sealing records because he failed to conduct a hearing and closed the arraignment without making specific finding or considering less restrictive measures; the judge’s reliance on the statutory protections closing hearings was error because they were not applicable.

If the person so summoned is other than a parent or guardian of the child, the parent or guardian or both shall also be notified of the pendency of the proceeding and of the time and place appointed.

     Temporary change in custody.
      </span>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If it appears to the court, by affidavit or by sworn testimony, that the child is a danger to himself or the community, or is in such condition or surroundings that his welfare is being harmed or threatened with harm to such a degree that his best interest requires that his custody be immediately changed by the court from the original custodian to another, the judge may sign an order giving temporary custody of the child to a suitable custodian consenting to temporary custody. However, if this case involves allegations of dependency, neglect, or abuse, no emergency removal or temporary custody orders shall be effective unless the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620" target="_self">Chapter 620</a></cite> are followed; and, if the case involves allegations of mental illness, the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc645" target="_self">Chapter 645</a></cite> shall be followed. As a part of such order, the court may direct that the child shall be taken into custody by the peace officer serving the summons or by any other peace officer and placed as directed by the court. In any event, a copy of the temporary custody order shall be served on the parent, guardian or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child when the summons is served. The temporary custody order shall be effective until the case is heard on its merits or until modified by the court. As a result of such order, the child shall be placed in custody and care in a home or other suitable facility.

        It was error for the family court to adjudicate the juvenile’s status as an habitual truant from school and to place the juvenile under the authority of the Department of Community Based Services when the juvenile was not present at the adjudication or the disposition hearing. Determinations in the juvenile’s absence violated his due process rights.

        It is the province of the legislature to open juvenile hearings to the public if they are to be opened. (Decided under prior law) Johnson v. Simpson, 433 S.W.2d 644, 1968<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS283" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 283</a></cite> (Ky. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        A juvenile judge cannot open the hearings in juvenile cases to reporters only on the condition that they not publish the names of children unless the judge gives specific permission and then exclude reporters who violate these terms while allowing others to remain. (Decided under prior law) Johnson v. Simpson, 433 S.W.2d 644, 1968<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS283" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 283</a></cite> (Ky. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of any statutory provision, a juvenile judge may not condition a reporter’s presence at the trial of an adult for contributing to the delinquency of minors upon his agreement to not publish the names of the children involved unless the judge allows him to do so. (Decided under prior law) Johnson v. Simpson, 433 S.W.2d 644, 1968<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS283" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 283</a></cite> (Ky. 1968).

        Although KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020ol112" target="_self">600.020(12)</a></cite> provides that the Unified Juvenile Code applies to matters conducted in the juvenile session of District Court, in light of subsection (3) of this section, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.340" target="_self">610.340</a></cite>, and Const., § 115, the public and press are to be excluded not only from all juvenile proceedings at the District Court level, but from all appellate proceedings stemming therefrom. F.T.P. v. Courier-Journal, 774 S.W.2d 444, 1989<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS48" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 48</a></cite> (Ky. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        To exclude the press at the district level, but admit them at the appellate level would tend to nullify the original intent and purpose of the Legislature and the wholesome policy of the Uniform Juvenile Act. F.T.P. v. Courier-Journal, 774 S.W.2d 444, 1989<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS48" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 48</a></cite> (Ky. 1989).

       <p>
        Exclusion of the press from juvenile court proceedings under the Kentucky Uniform Juvenile Code, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.070" target="_self">610.070</a></cite>, did not violate a press association’s First Amendment right of access to the courts because (1) the right of access was not extended to juvenile proceedings, and (2) the presumption of openness did not apply to juvenile proceedings as they were historically closed to the public and public access to such proceedings would frustrate the purpose of the juvenile courts. Ky. Press Ass'n v. State, 355 F. Supp. 2d 853, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2514 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.2005" target="_blank">Ky. 2005</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court judge was ordered to provide members of the media with a copy of the recording of a criminal arraignment and to refrain from closing any future proceeding that was ordinarily open to the public and from sealing records because he failed to conduct a hearing and closed the arraignment without making specific finding or considering less restrictive measures; the judge’s reliance on the statutory protections closing hearings was error because they were not applicable.

        A detention hearing for juvenile at which juvenile admitted to the charged offenses, was not transformed from a determination of probable cause for detention into an acceptance of a guilty plea, since no inquiry was made of the veracity of the charges or admission, no inquiry was made to determine if the plea was voluntary, and no inquiry was made as to nature of the charges. Laswell v. Frey, 45 F.3d 1011, 1995 FED App. 0036P, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 1537 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 874, 116 S. Ct. 199, 133 L. Ed. 2d 134, 1995 U.S. LEXIS 6246 (U.S. 1995).

The investigation shall include an inquiry into the child’s age, habits, school record, general reputation, and everything that may pertain to his or her life, and character. The investigation shall also include an inquiry into the home conditions, life, and character of the person having custody of the child. The investigation shall also include an assessment of the parent or guardian’s ability to pay all or part of the cost of the child’s care and treatment should the child be ordered into a treatment program or placed on supervised probation.

        In order to determine whether Kentucky owed foster care maintenance payments under the Child Welfare Act for children who were placed with their aunt, it was necessary to decide whether the family court affirmatively discharged the children from state custody, as the Act required payments only when the children's placement and care were the state's responsibility; denial of benefits because the aunt was related to the children would violate federal law.

        In order to determine whether Kentucky owed foster care maintenance payments under the Child Welfare Act for children who were placed with their aunt, it was necessary to decide whether the family court affirmatively discharged the children from state custody, as the Act required payments only when the children's placement and care were the state's responsibility; denial of benefits because the aunt was related to the children would violate federal law.

      Upon recommendation of the Department of Juvenile Justice or the cabinet or upon its own initiative, the court may order any parent, guardian, or person exercising similar custodial control or supervision of a child referred to the court to cooperate and actively participate in such treatment or social service programs which might reasonably be expected to meet the goal of enhancing the best interests of the child and family unity. When it appears to the court that the parents have failed to cooperate and actively participate in said programs, the court may issue a summons for the parents of the child which shall require them to attend a hearing in which they may rebut any evidence which may allege that they have violated a court order. The court may exercise its powers of contempt in addition to any other remedy provided by law to compel obedience of the parents, guardian, or person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child to the court’s orders.

       A married child under the age of 16 has a legal responsibility to attend school, but once a child marries, the parent or guardian no longer has a legal obligation to ensure that the child attends school; however, if the spouse of a minor who is under the age of 16 and who is an habitual truant, is found to be a person exercising custodial control or supervision as defined in subdivision (26) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020" target="_self">600.020</a></cite>, the spouse may be subject to penalties under the Juvenile Code.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG87-40" target="_blank">OAG 87-40</a></cite>.

The order shall direct that the money be paid to the circuit clerk to be disbursed as ordered by the court or be paid to the person, facility, agency, or the Department of Juvenile Justice or cabinet to which the child was committed or probated. On application and on such notice as the court may direct, the court may make alterations in the requirement for contribution. The court may issue such orders necessary to compel payment of the sum due. The enforcement of a sentence imposed on a parent who fails to comply with the order of the court may be suspended at the discretion of the court, but the suspension may be revoked at the discretion of the court upon the failure of the parent to obey further orders of the court. This section shall not apply when the parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of the child was the victim of the child’s criminal conduct under KRS Chapters 635 or 640, or filed the complaint against the child under other provisions of the Unified Juvenile Code.

     <p>
      A parent or other person exercising custodial control or supervision of a child is charged with the control of such child and shall have the power to exercise parental control and authority over such child. In any case where a child is adjudicated a public offender and placed on probation, if the court finds at the hearing that the person having custody of such child has failed or neglected to subject him to reasonable parental control and authority, and that such failure or neglect is the proximate cause of the act or acts of the child upon which the adjudication is based, the court may require such parent to enter into a recognizance with sufficient surety, in an amount of not more than five hundred dollars ($500), conditioned upon the faithful discharge of the conditions of probation of such child. If the child thereafter commits a second act and is by reason thereof adjudicated a public offender, or violates the conditions of probation, and the court finds at the hearing that the failure or neglect of such parent to subject him to reasonable parental control and authority or to faithfully discharge the conditions of probation of such child on the part of such parent, is the proximate cause of the act of the child upon which such second finding is based, or upon which such child is found to have violated the conditions of his probation, the court may declare all or a part of the recognizance forfeited and the amount of such forfeited recognizance shall be applied in payment of any damages which may have been caused by such child, if there be such damages, otherwise, the proceeds therefrom, or part remaining after the payment of damages as aforesaid, shall be retained by the court to apply to any future damages resulting from the act or acts of said child before he reaches his eighteenth birthday, at which date the remaining proceeds shall be returned to the parent or guardian. The provisions of this section as it relates to failure or neglect of parents to subject a child to reasonable parental control and authority shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other sections of KRS Chapters 600 to 645 relating to failure or neglect to exercise such parental control or authority. The provisions of this section shall not apply to foster parents.

        The system of selective placement of juveniles in the county jail for dispositional and predispositional purposes, although for limited periods of time, constituted a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it was treating, for punitive purposes, the juveniles as adults and yet not according them, for due process purposes, the rights accorded to adults. Baker v. Hamilton, 345 F. Supp. 345, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14032 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.1972" target="_blank">Ky. 1972</a></cite>).

        A minor’s arrest for curfew violation where he was refused a telephone call to his parents when taken to jail by the arresting officer who refused to notify minor’s parents together with minor’s confinement with the general jail population without a probable cause hearing, constituted “cruel and unusual punishment” in violation of his rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Cox v.

        Where officer taking two (2) juvenile brothers under the age of 14 to police substation from their home did not tell the brothers or their 16 year old sister of the specific charges of vandalism against them, the specific statute violated, their Miranda rights, did not remain at home for parents who were due to return soon, did not state the time and place of detention and offered no reason as to the necessity for keeping the children in custody, he violated the provisions of former law regarding arrest of children, since he neither immediately notified the parents of the details of the arrest nor immediately released them into the custody of the parents in the absence of circumstances necessitating secure custody, the statutory language of former law regarding arrest of children being mandatory rather than directory.

    Where the inmate was a juvenile when he committed a murder and the police technically violated KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.200" target="_self">610.200</a></cite> when they failed to contact the inmate’s mother but then advised the inmate of his Miranda rights and began questioning him, the admission of the inmate’s police statement did not violate his due process rights because: (1) the police did everything in their power to comply with the statute, (2) the inmate was not harmed by any errors the police may have made, and (3) there was no indication that the inmate’s statement was involuntary. The district court’s denial of the inmate’s 28 U.S.C.S. § 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus was affirmed. Mayberry v. Motley, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 638 (6th Cir. Ky. Jan. 12, 2005).

        A system of selective placement of juveniles in the county jail for dispositional and predispositional purposes, although for limited periods of time, constituted a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in that it was treating, for punitive purposes, the juveniles as adults and yet not according them, for due process purposes, the rights accorded to adults.

       The Kentucky State Police improperly relied on subsection (3) of this section, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11a" target="_blank">61.878(1)(a)</a></cite> and (k), and<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.050" target="_self">620.050(</a></cite>4), in denying a request to inspect the files generated in the course of its investigation into a candidate for county sheriff who was charged with sodomy, sexual abuse and unlawful transaction with a minor. Although the privacy interests of the juveniles whose names appeared in those records were superior to the public’s interest in disclosure of their identities, that interest could be protected by redaction of the juveniles’ names and personally identifiable information. The candidate’s privacy interests, however, were outweighed by the public’s interest in assessing his fitness to serve as county sheriff, and the public’s interest in evaluating the performance of the Kentucky State Police in investigating the case. OAG 93-ORD-42.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (3) of this section, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11k" target="_blank">61.878(1)(k)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.050" target="_self">620.050(</a></cite>4) are aimed at protecting juveniles, and not adults who are criminally prosecuted for victimizing juveniles. OAG 93-ORD-42.
      </p>
      <p>
       A transcript of grand jury testimony is a record subject to the exclusive control of the judiciary. Therefore, a person seeking the release of grand jury testimony involving reference to a juvenile covered by this section, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.340" target="_self">610.340</a></cite>, or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.340" target="_self">610.340</a></cite>(6) must do so by motion to the court with control over the record.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG95-17" target="_blank">OAG 95-17</a></cite>.

      <p>
       The protection provided by subsection (3) of this section, which is incorporated into the Open Records Act by operation of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11" target="_blank">61.878(1)</a></cite>(

    ), is not expressly, or by implication, limited to living juveniles nor does it exclude from its coverage situations where the juvenile has died; thus the Urban County Government properly denied a reporter’s request to inspect documents and records regarding the suicides of two juveniles. 95-ORD-7.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deletion of juvenile law enforcement records, per subsection (3) of this section and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11" target="_blank">61.878(1)</a></cite>(

    ), from an existing database of arrest records is not equivalent to the production of a record in a specially tailored or nonstandardized format within the meaning of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.874ol13" target="_blank">61.874(3)</a></cite>, thus, the Division of Police is required to discharge this duty under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol14" target="_blank">61.878(4)</a></cite>, provide the requested records, and bear the cost of redaction. OAG 95-ORD-82.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (3) prohibits disclosure of juvenile law enforcement records, but does not apply when the law enforcement records relate to a juvenile victim of crime; nevertheless, portions of those law enforcement records revealing the identity of the victim may be withheld under authority of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11a" target="_blank">61.878(1)(a)</a></cite> when, because of the nature and circumstances of the crime perpetrated against the juvenile, his privacy interests outweigh the public’s interest in disclosure.

        The purpose of the shroud of secrecy and confidentiality mandated by this section and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.070" target="_self">610.070</a></cite> is to protect the juvenile, and clearly this purpose was uppermost in the minds of the General Assembly; it was intended that trials of juveniles not be publicized in the news media, as such publicity would possibly deprive the juvenile of a fair trial and, more particularly, would likely diminish his or her prospect for rehabilitation. F.T.P. v. Courier-Journal, 774 S.W.2d 444, 1989<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS48" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 48</a></cite> (Ky. 1989).

        Although KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020ol112" target="_self">600.020(12)</a></cite> provides that the Unified Juvenile Code applies to matters conducted in the juvenile session of District Court, in light of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.070ol13" target="_self">610.070(3)</a></cite>, this section, and Const., § 115, the public and press are to be excluded not only from all juvenile proceedings at the District Court level, but from all appellate proceedings stemming therefrom. F.T.P. v. Courier-Journal, 774 S.W.2d 444, 1989<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS48" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 48</a></cite> (Ky. 1989).

        To exclude the press at the district level, but admit them at the appellate level would tend to nullify the original intent and purpose of the Legislature and the wholesome policy of the Uniform Juvenile Act.

        Confidentiality of juvenile court records under the Kentucky Uniform Juvenile Code, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.340" target="_self">610.340</a></cite> did not violate a press association’s First Amendment right of access to the courts because (1) the right of access was not extended to juvenile proceedings, and (2) the presumption of openness did not apply to juvenile proceedings as they were historically closed to the public and public access to such proceedings would frustrate the purpose of the juvenile courts. Ky. Press Ass'n v. State, 355 F. Supp. 2d 853, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2514 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.2005" target="_blank">Ky. 2005</a></cite>).

        Trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motion to allow a juvenile expert from his attorney’s office to review the juvenile court records of several of the victims because defendant provided no evidence that the dispositional information would be exculpatory, but merely only made vague references that what transpired in the juvenile cases would be part of his defense and would be exculpatory.

       A juvenile court’s orders appointing attorneys as specific juveniles’ guardians ad litem and orders authorizing their payment in specific cases are confidential juvenile court records and as such are excluded from public view, however, a public agency’s records that a specific attorney was paid a sum certain out of public funds for his or her service in a specific court as a guardian ad litem are not; if the agency’s records include the names of the juveniles involved, making release of such information an invasion of the juveniles’ privacy, those names may be removed from the records before allowing access to the records.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG90-62" target="_blank">OAG 90-62</a></cite>.

       In proceedings in the juvenile session of the District Court, no court fees shall be charged against, and no witness fees shall be allowed to, any party to a petition. No public officer shall be entitled to receive any fee from the service of process or for attendance in court in any such proceedings.

The payments for fees provided by law for like services in civil cases in the Circuit Court are to be made out of the county treasury. The county or state may compensate any officer or person in the amount prescribed by law for the transportation of a child to a place where he will be detained or placed or the return of any child to the jurisdiction of the court, and funds for this purpose may be appropriated and paid by the fiscal court.

        The attempt by a Circuit Court to provide that neither the District Court nor Circuit Court would hear cases or any orders therein involving dependency or custody of children until the petitioner agreed to pay the fees of and costs expended by the guardian ad litem was an effort by that court to do what the statutes and decisions of the Kentucky courts have prohibited and the Circuit Court judgment on that point would be reversed.

     <p>
      The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4<cite class="US_code"><a href="#U.S.C.sec.112" target="_blank">U.S.C. sec. 112</a></cite> (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.

     <p>
      It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:

        This section creates an affirmative duty for the parent of a child to prevent such physical injury which would result in an assault on that child and this duty was clearly violated by defendant mother where evidence showed that the child’s injuries were not consistent with the history given by the defendant that the injuries were a result of a recent fall down the stairs and where many of the injuries were linear, they appeared to have resulted from the child being struck with a linear object, and did not appear accidental but were of an inflicted manner.

        Finding that a child was abused or neglected under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020" target="_self">600.020</a></cite> was not supported by substantial evidence because a family court failed to determine the truth or falsity of all the allegations in a complaint under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.100" target="_self">620.100</a></cite>, and it relied upon information outside the record that was neither raised as an allegation in the complaint nor presented as evidence during a hearing; also, a dependency, neglect, or abuse adjudication hearing was not the appropriate forum for rehashing custody issues. Even though judicial notice of a prior case involving the mother and father could have been taken, the family court’s consideration of the evidence it heard in the earlier action was improper; moreover, there was no notice or opportunity to be heard relating to the taking of judicial notice.

        There was no error in the judgment regarding reasonable efforts for the mother, for purposes of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090ol13" target="_self">625.090(3)</a></cite>,<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.020" target="_self">620.020(</a></cite>11), given that the Cabinet of Health and Family Services offered the mother many services, but she ultimately stopped attending parenting classes, participating in drug tests and abstaining from drug and alcohol use, completing various assessments, and making planned visits with the child; there was substantial evidence that the Cabinet offered services to the mother and she failed to avail herself of those services. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS301" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 301</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).

        Pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.127ol17" target="_self">610.127(7)</a></cite>, reasonable efforts are not required as defined in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.020" target="_self">620.020</a></cite> when the court determines with respect to a parent that the parent has created circumstances that make continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify the family inconsistent with the best interests of the child and with the permanency plan for the child. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS301" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 301</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court found that the Cabinet of Health and Family Services made reasonable efforts to reunite the parents with the child, and considering the neglect and parents’
    lack of insight and lack of progress on their case plans, the trial court properly found that termination was in the child’s best interests. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS301" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 301</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father asked that reasonable efforts to reunite him with the child be stopped, the trial court granted this request under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.127" target="_self">610.127</a></cite>, and thereafter, the father did not try to work with the Cabinet of Health and Family Services again; he admitted to smoking marijuana and said he would continue doing so, he threatened staff members of the Cabinet, he refused to participate in any case plan, the Cabinet does not have the power to compel someone to accept reasonable efforts, and substantial evidence existed to support the finding that reasonable efforts were made but the father refused them. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS301" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 301</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) made reasonable efforts to reunite the family because CHFS referred the father to an abusive parenting program recognized by Kentucky; the father failed to complete the abusive parenting class as he refused to admit abusing his daughter; although the father lived in Michigan, CHFS was not required to become familiar with services offered around the world in the event a parent chose to relocate to another state or country; no matter where the father moved, a qualifying program would require the same admission; and he did not take advantage of services offered and did not sufficiently progress toward completion of the treatment plan.

        The family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding custody to the child’s grandmother and aunt. The grandmother and aunt were already the child’s physical custodians after findings of abuse and neglect had caused removal of the child from the home, so they were de facto custodians and were on equal footing with the father; therefore, the best interest standards under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403s403.270ol12" target="_blank">403.270(2)</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.023" target="_self">620.023</a></cite> were the proper guidelines and were properly applied to grant the grandmother and aunt permanent custody.

       <p>
        Substantial evidence supported neglect finding because (1) it was no error to consider a father’s prior termination of parental rights in which abuse or neglect had to be found, which was relevant, and whether substance abuse incapacitated the father had to be considered, and (2) the evidence showed the father’s drug use and the earlier proceeding caused and exacerbated the father’s legal problems involving children, and the father’s incorrect prescription use showed continued dependency and a fear of withdrawal.

        Family court properly denied the grandparents’ motion to be considered for placement of their grandchild because the family court properly used the statutory factors, its five-page order contained ample substantial evidence justifying its decision to deny the grandparents’ plea for placement, and, given the child’s age, traumatic past, and significant improvement in the foster home, it would not be in her best interest to be uprooted, again, to experiment with a relative placement with people with whom she had not bonded—or even knew, and the grandfather’s criminal history, domestic violence, and past parental concerns weighed heavily in favor of it not being in the child’s best interest to live with him.

     District Court’s concurrent jurisdiction for child custody and visitation in permanent placement cases.
      </span>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The District Court has jurisdiction, concurrent with that of the Circuit Court, to determine matters of child custody and visitation in cases that come before the District Court where the need for a permanent placement and custody order is established as set forth in this chapter. The District Court, in making these determinations, shall utilize the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403" target="_blank">Chapter 403</a></cite> relating to child custody and visitation. In any case where the child is actually residing with a grandparent in a stable relationship, the court may recognize the grandparent as having the same standing as a parent for evaluating what custody arrangements are in the best interest of the child.

        Where a hospital employee allegedly made a false report to authorities that a newborn child’s meconium stool sample tested positive for drugs, which led to the child’s being placed in foster care, a doctor was immune from civil liability for the report under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.030ol11" target="_self">620.030(1)</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.050ol11" target="_self">620.050(1)</a></cite>, because there was no allegation that she acted in bad faith.

        To find that KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.030" target="_self">620.030</a></cite> does not apply, there must be a finding that the act committed upon the child is not an act of sexual abuse. For purposes of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600" target="_self">Chapter 600</a></cite>, the definition of a neglected or abused child is set forth at KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020" target="_self">600.020</a></cite>. If sexual abuse has occurred, then the mandatory reporting requirement in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.030" target="_self">620.030</a></cite> would have required the teacher to report this incident and such mandatory reporting would result in this being considered a ministerial rather than a discretionary act which would preclude the teacher from claiming qualified official immunity. Nelson v. Turner, 256 S.W.3d 37, 2008<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS177" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 177</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).

        Trial court did not err in granting a neighbor’s motion to dismiss an action filed by a mother and father alleging that their child was removed from their home based on a false report because the neighbor was entitled to immunity under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.030ol11" target="_self">620.030(1)</a></cite> when the mother and father failed to demonstrate that the neighbor acted in bad faith in reporting suspected child neglect; the neighbor reported the suspected neglect to her local law enforcement agency, and it did not matter that the police officer she spoke with was her son because he was a member of her local law enforcement agency.

        In a report of child neglect to the Kentucky Cabinet of Health and Family Services' Department of Community Based Services based on a four-year-old student wandering away from a school, who was found approximately one-half mile away, the trial court did not err in dismissing appellant's claims against her employer alleging wrongful discharge, negligence and vicarious liability, and defamation as the record did not support any allegations that the employer's report of neglect was done in bad faith as appellant did not dispute that the child wandered away from the school while she was working; and, although appellant was ultimately exonerated from having committed neglect, an erroneous belief regarding neglect did not constitute bad faith.

       Although subsection (3) (now (4)) of this section provides that agencies providing services to children, such as schools, must cooperate with the Cabinet for Human Resources (CHR) and provide assistance and information, such interviews should be conducted in a manner that causes the least disruption to the students’ school schedule and the procedures vary if the allegations of student abuse are against school personnel.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-138" target="_blank">OAG 92-138</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the police desire to talk with a student who is a victim of a crime, then the school authorities should use their best judgment in determining whether the parents should be contacted. In the event that the officer is investigating allegations of dependency, neglect or abuse, the school should allow the interview to occur at school. The school should consult with the officer before the school officials inform the parents that an interview has taken place.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-138" target="_blank">OAG 92-138</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       School officials should use their discretion and confer with the police officer in deciding whether to be present when the court designated worker or the police questions a student. If the child is a victim of abuse, then the child should have input on choosing a trusted adult to sit in during the interview.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-138" target="_blank">OAG 92-138</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the school is not required to notify the parents before the Cabinet for Human Resources talks with the students, the fact that the parents cannot be reached is immaterial.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-138" target="_blank">OAG 92-138</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The school system is required pursuant to this section to permit social workers from the Cabinet for Human Resources (CHR) to come into the school and talk with students regarding investigations of dependency, neglect or abuse.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-138" target="_blank">OAG 92-138</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether school personnel should be present when the social workers question the students is a decision that is best left to the discretion of the Cabinet for Human Resources’ social worker conducting the interview.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-138" target="_blank">OAG 92-138</a></cite>.

        When a district court ordered the Department for Community Based Services of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services—which investigated and found no substantiation for a parent’s claims that the other abused their child—to open a case and further assess the family needs, it violated the separation of powers doctrine. The district court usurped the Cabinet’s authority to the benefit of the complaining parent who presented nothing in the case except two unsworn petitions in two different emergency protective order cases.

        In a report of child neglect to the Kentucky Cabinet of Health and Family Services' Department of Community Based Services based on a four-year-old student wandering away from a school, who was found approximately one-half mile away, the trial court did not err in dismissing appellant's claims against her employer alleging wrongful discharge, negligence and vicarious liability, and defamation as the record did not support any allegations that the employer's report of neglect was done in bad faith as appellant did not dispute that the child wandered away from the school while she was working; and, although appellant was ultimately exonerated from having committed neglect, an erroneous belief regarding neglect did not constitute bad faith.

       This section requires schools to continue to allow the Cabinet for Human Resources (CHR) to interview children on school premises without consent of parents in the course of an abuse investigation if that is the course of action determined appropriate by the CHR.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG87-33" target="_blank">OAG 87-33</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department for Social Services acted properly when it refused to make available for inspection to the alleged perpetrator of child abuse the names of informants and those portions of the statements of a judge and an informant wherein those parties set forth personal opinions, observations, and recommendations not related to the child abuse investigation and the findings resulting from that investigation.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG87-82" target="_blank">OAG 87-82</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public agency’s refusal to furnish records and documents to the requesting party relative to an investigation of an alleged instance of child abuse and neglect was supported by subdivision (1)(j) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878" target="_blank">61.878</a></cite> and subsection (4) of this section.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG88-4" target="_blank">OAG 88-4</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cabinet for Human Resources acted consistently with the Open Records Laws to the extent that it withheld from inspection the names of informants which spawned its investigation pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11a" target="_blank">61.878(1)(a)</a></cite> and (j) and subdivision (4)(a) of this section, and to the extent that it denied inspection of the verbal complaint or oral allegations made by an individual to an employee of the cabinet. However, the cabinet acted inconsistently with the Open Records Law to the extent that it denied inspection of the written complaint which initially spawned the investigation, although, the names of informants contained within the written complaint may properly be withheld.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-33" target="_blank">OAG 91-33</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where person requesting documents regarding detention of student at a school and the report and findings of an investigation conducted by the Department for Social Services did not demonstrate that he fell under any of the statutorily recognized classifications of this section or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878" target="_blank">61.878</a></cite> or that his particular situation warranted the release of the requested material, his request was properly denied.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-93" target="_blank">OAG 91-93</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (4) is applicable to information obtained as a result of a joint investigation by the Cabinet for Human Resources and the Kentucky State Police.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-173" target="_blank">OAG 91-173</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section clearly requires that the Cabinet for Human Resources and the Department for Social Services withhold from all persons information acquired as a result of an investigation conducted pursuant to this section, unless the requesting party can demonstrate that he or she satisfies one of the requirements set forth in subsection (4)(a) through (4)(f) of this section. Thus where, although the requesting party was currently involved in a custody dispute with his former wife, she was the custodial parent, and the allegations of abuse were not substantiated, the requesting party could not be said to have satisfied the requirements of subsection (4)(e) of this section and his open records request was properly denied.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-53" target="_blank">OAG 92-53</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (4) of this section KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11k" target="_blank">61.878(1)(k)</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.320ol13" target="_self">610.320(3)</a></cite> are aimed at protecting juveniles, and not adults who are criminally prosecuted for victimizing juveniles. OAG 93-ORD-42.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kentucky State Police improperly relied on subsection (4) of this section, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11a" target="_blank">61.878(1)(a)</a></cite> and (k), and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.320ol13" target="_self">610.320(3)</a></cite> in denying a request to inspect the files generated in the course of its investigation into a candidate for county sheriff who was charged with sodomy, sexual abuse and unlawful transaction with a minor. Although the privacy interests of the juveniles whose names appeared in those records were superior to the public’s interest in disclosure of their identities, that interest could be protected by redaction of the juveniles’ names and personally identifiable information. The candidate’s privacy interests, however, were outweighed by the public’s interest in assessing his fitness to serve as county sheriff, and the public’s interest in evaluating the performance of the Kentucky State Police in investigating the case. OAG 93-ORD-42.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the Kentucky State Police is acting as the Cabinet for Human Resources’ designated representative in conducting a joint investigation into allegations of dependency, neglect, or abuse, as opposed to independently conducting an investigation into possible criminal charges against an adult, subsection (4) of this section does not operate to authorize nondisclosure of the records it compiles. OAG 93-ORD-42.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Social Services improperly denied the Kentucky Board of Nursing’s request for medical records referenced in a report prepared by the Department in the course of an investigation into suspected child abuse pursuant to subsection (4) of this section, which is incorporated into the Open Records Act by operation of subdivision (1)(k) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878" target="_blank">61.878</a></cite>.

       A child who does not receive necessary medical care due to his parents’ religious belief may considered an abused or neglected child; accordingly, the reporting requirements of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.030" target="_self">620.030</a></cite> (1) and the investigation requirements of subsection (3) of this section are mandatory and must be followed in cases involving the religious exemption contained in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020" target="_self">600.020</a></cite> (1).<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG93-84" target="_blank">OAG 93-84</a></cite>.

       Since the shroud of secrecy mandated by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.050ol14" target="_self">620.050(4)</a></cite> is “not intended to protect the identities of adults and employees of a public agency charged with violations of the criminal laws,” but is instead intended to protect the affected families, and in particular, the affected children, the Cabinet for Human Resources could not persuasively argue that it was bound by the confidentiality provision found at KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.050ol14" target="_self">620.050(4)</a></cite> in witholding unsubstantiated complaints of abuse against its employees, and, at the same time, that it was free to release most, if not all, of the remaining records it compiled in its investigation of alleged employee misconduct.

      <p>
       Cabinet for Health Service properly relied on KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.872ol16" target="_blank">61.872(6)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878" target="_blank">61.878(</a></cite>1)(a), (k) and (l) and various confidentiality provisions found in both state (KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc209s209.140" target="_blank">209.140</a></cite>,<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc210s210.235" target="_blank">210.235,</a></cite><cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc214s214.420" target="_blank">214.420,</a></cite><cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc214s214.625" target="_blank">214.625</a></cite> and<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.050" target="_self">620.050)</a></cite> and federal law, in denying request for inspection of all nursing facility licensure inspection reports for a two year period where the Cabinet sustained the burden of showing that such request was an unreasonable burden on the Cabinet in describing with specificity the actual volumes of records implicated by the request and where the exemptions to disclosure provided by the state and federal law were mandatory and the difficulty of separation of confidential from releasable information constituted an unreasonable burden. 97-ORD-88.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Cabinet for Families and Children properly relied on KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11a" target="_blank">61.878(1)(a)</a></cite>, in addition to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc194Bs194B.060" target="_blank">194B.060</a></cite> and subsection (4) of this section, which are incorporated into the Open Records Act by operation of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11l" target="_blank">61.878(1)(l)</a></cite>, in denying a request for a copy of the Children’s Protective Services Report relating to two (2) children identified in the request and their mother. OAG 99-ORD-197.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the requester has established that she has “relative placement” of at least one of her grandchildren, she has not established that she is the children’s custodial parent or legal guardian within the meaning of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.050ol15b" target="_self">620.050(5)(b)</a></cite> or that she otherwise falls within one of the remaining statutorily recognized classifications. A letter prepared by a social worker does not invest her with the status of custodial parent or legal guardian. Nor has she produced a court order directing disclosure of the disputed records to her. Insofar as none of the criteria found in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.050ol15" target="_self">620.050(5)</a></cite> are satisfied, the requester is not entitled to receive a copy of those records pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11l" target="_blank">61.878(1)(l)</a></cite>.

        Circuit court properly committed a father’s 31-month-old child to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services because there was an emergency where the father was arrested on drug charges and drugs and a handgun were seized from a child’s bedroom, the stepmother did not meet the requirements of a de facto custodian where it was not established that the POA the father purportedly executed made her the child’s legal guardian, the father’s three blood relatives were eliminated from consideration as either living with, or being, drug traffickers, and the least restrictive appropriate placement available was the foster mother with whom the child has spent the majority of his life.

        Circuit court properly committed a father’s 31-month-old child to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services because there was an emergency where the father was arrested on drug charges and drugs and a handgun were seized from a child’s bedroom, the stepmother did not meet the requirements of a de facto custodian where it was not established that the POA the father purportedly executed made her the child’s legal guardian, the father’s three blood relatives were eliminated from consideration as either living with, or being, drug traffickers, and the least restrictive appropriate placement available was the foster mother with whom the child has spent the majority of his life.

        In a dependency proceeding, the father’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on an alleged failure to more zealously pursue the father’s position that the pastor committed the alleged abuse and that other family members coaxed the child into making sexual allegations lacked merit, where there was no error committed by counsel or deficiencies in counsel’s performance which demanded that a deprivation of due process be found.

        Circuit court properly denied a father's petition for immediate entitlement to custody of his eight-year-old child, which followed a removal hearing after a fire claimed the lives of her mother and her brothers because the child's best interests were served by her maternal grandmother retaining custody where the father, who lived in South Carolina, admitted he had not seen the child in person in over two years, the child was close to the grandmother, was well-adapted and familiar with her school and other surroundings, the circuit court intended to ease the child into her new reality, and the legal balance between the father's rights and the protection of the child had to be struck in favor of the child.

        Trial court erred in its restricted application of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.110" target="_self">620.110</a></cite> where it misconstrued case law focused exclusively on parents to mean that only parents could invoke §<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.110" target="_self">620.110</a></cite> to seek relief from a temporary removal order. Notwithstanding that error, consideration of the appeal was severely hampered given the lack of a clear statement of preservation, as required by Ky. R. Civ. P. 76.12(4)(c)(v), there was no recording of the §<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.110" target="_self">620.110</a></cite> hearing, and the record had been certified without an avowal. The great aunt and uncle had not shown that they were aggrieved where the only connection the they alleged with the child was a blood connection, and that bare allegation, without proof of an actual connection between the child and the great aunt and uncle, was not enough to trigger relief.

        Because a trial court merely reinstated educational services that were suspended by the Cabinet’s procedure of issuing a letter of intent to release and the order of education stood until modified or vacated, there was no error in the order of the trial court reinstating a former dependent minor’s commitment to the Cabinet.

        District court erred in entering a complete, no contact order of removal because the court entered a conclusory ruling, and in addition to there being no substantial evidence supporting any of the findings of fact—or the removal itself—in the adjudication order or the disposition order, the court failed to justify why this was the only result the court considered. Further, when the father’s counsel urged the consideration of at least some form of visitation, the court rejected it with no explanation. T.C. v.

       The cabinet may accept custody of a child who is voluntarily committed to the cabinet by the child’s parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody. However, the cabinet shall refuse to accept any child on a voluntary commitment unless adequate facilities, funds, and resources are available to care for the child, and the secretary finds that commitment would be in the best interest of the child.

       As a condition of any voluntary commitment, the cabinet may enter into an agreement with the parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody of the child consenting to the commitment to pay an agreed sum for the care and treatment of the child. The sum shall be determined by the needs of the child and by the ability of the parent, guardian, or other person having legal custody or other person exercising custodial control or to pay.

    Any person who has consented to a child’s voluntary commitment may request the release of the child in writing addressed to the cabinet. The cabinet shall within ten (10) days release the child, or, if in the opinion of the cabinet it would be in the best interest of the child to remain in the custody of the cabinet, a petition shall be filed in the court of the county of residence of the child as provided in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.030" target="_self">620.030</a></cite> to<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc620s620.050" target="_self">620.050.</a></cite>

        Termination of a mother’s and a father’s parental rights was supported by substantial evidence and was in their children’s best interests because there was ongoing domestic violence between the mother and the father and the parents and the children, the parents did little to resolve their drug and alcohol dependency, the parents continuously or repeatedly failed to provide or were incapable of providing essential food, clothing, shelter, medical care or education reasonably necessary and available for the children’s well-being and there was no reasonable expectation of significant improvement in the parents’
    conduct in the immediately foreseeable future, one child was sexually abused by her parents and her uncles, another child was deemed a high suicide risk, and the parents failed to make sufficient progress toward identified goals as set forth in the court-approved case plan which would have allowed for the children’s safe return.

        A parent who has transferred possession and custody of his or her child to another has surrendered the primary right of custody and thereafter the court shall determine custody on the basis of the best interest of the child. (Decided under prior law) Van Wey v. Van Wey, 656 S.W.2d 731, 1983<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS300" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 300</a></cite> (Ky. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1066, 104 S. Ct. 1416, 79 L. Ed. 2d 742 (U.S. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the mother, who voluntarily, over a period of months, arranged to give up child for adoption, had understandable “reasons” to give up her child and “cause” to wish to regain her child did not obviate the burden on her to show that to return custody to her would be for the child’s best interest; the mother must bear this burden even in the absence of proof that she is unfit in the context of the standard established by the involuntary termination statute (abandonment, neglect or abuse). (Decided under prior law) Van Wey v. Van Wey, 656 S.W.2d 731, 1983<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS300" target="_blank">Ky.

        Where mother’s petition to terminate parental rights was initially voluntary, but the mother later attempted to revoke her consent, the court had a responsibility to consider the overall welfare of the child in deciding whether or not to permit such revocation; “sufficient reason” to revoke means more than emotional distress at the time the petition for voluntary termination is filed.

        Family court erred in converting an involuntary termination action against a father into a voluntary termination action because he failed to comply with the statutory procedure for voluntarily terminating his parental rights by filing a verified petition with the court, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services did not sign the Appearance-Waiver and Consent forms, crucial information was absent from the record, and the Cabinet objected to the voluntary termination.

        Although the petitions for termination of parental rights were written in a bare bones manner and the allegations were couched in conclusory language, substantial justice was done in that the pleadings gave fair notice of what was taking place; therefore, procedural due process was not lacking. (Decided under prior law) V.S. v. Commonwealth, Cabinet for Human Resources, 706 S.W.2d 420, 1986<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS1069" target="_blank">Ky.

        Placement with relatives may be an option for consideration by the Cabinet for Human Resources but nothing more; once this section has been complied with and a review of the Cabinet’s program for the children is determined to be reasonable, then there can be no valid argument for want of due process in this regard.

        Trial court incorrectly applied Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 625 to a step-mother’s amended petition because it was an adoption, and therefore, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 199 governed the entirety of the amended petition seeking adoption. E.K. v. T.A., 572 S.W.3d 80, 2019<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS32" target="_blank">Ky.

        By its nature, adoption under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 199 vitiates parental rights of biological parents. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc199s199.520" target="_blank">199.520(</a></cite>2); when there is a dual petition involving an adoption and involuntary termination of parental rights, the adoption supersedes the termination because § 199 encompasses Ky.

        Where the State petitioned to involuntarily terminate parental rights, where the parents thereafter petitioned to voluntarily terminate their parental rights upon the condition that the child’s paternal grandparents be permitted to adopt him, and where the paternal grandparents moved to intervene, the trial court properly denied their motion because a proceeding for the termination of parental rights concerned the relationship between parent and child and not any other party; the grandparents simply had no cognizable rights to protect or enforce in a termination proceeding.

        In a parental rights termination case, the family court properly admitted testimony by a family therapist and a pediatrician about a child’s account of his sexual abuse at the hands of his parents and uncles. The testimony was admissible under KRE 803(4) as statements made for purposes of medical treatment or diagnosis, and the restriction on the use of hearsay evidence in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354, 158 L. Ed. 2d 177, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 1838 (2004), did not apply to civil cases. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs. v.

        Because an indigent mother and father were not afforded counsel at a goal change hearing held before the District Court, as well as during other critical stages of the dependency action, an order terminating their parental rights was improper, as such detrimentally affected the termination proceeding before the Circuit Court when the court made an erroneous finding of fact that the child had been in foster care for 15 of the preceding 22 months.

        In a dependency proceeding, the father’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on an alleged failure to more zealously pursue the father’s position that the pastor committed the alleged abuse and that other family members coaxed the child into making sexual allegations lacked merit, where there was no error committed by counsel or deficiencies in counsel’s performance which demanded that a deprivation of due process be found.

        Parents did not prove that their decision to be unrepresented took place at a critical stage of the underlying dependency case, and the court’s review supported the proposition that manifest injustice did not happen here; the parents chose to dismiss counsel during the dependency action, and when the case became a termination action, they were given counsel and accepted representation, such that no error occurred.

        The court exceeded its authority where, although it found sufficient evidence to terminate parental rights, it declined to do so provided that the parents comply with all the conditions detailed in the court’s order. Cabinet for Human Resources v. J.B.B., 772 S.W.2d 646, 1989<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS82" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 82</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).

        Absence, voluntary or court-imposed, may be a factor to consider in determining whether the children have been neglected. (Decisions under prior law.) J.H. v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 704 S.W.2d 661, 1985<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS719" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 719</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1985).

        Where for reasons other than poverty alone, the incarcerated father continuously or repeatedly failed to provide or was incapable of providing essential food, clothing, shelter, medical care or education reasonably necessary and available for the children’s well-being and there was no reasonable expectation of significant improvement, and where the incarcerated parent never contributed to the economic well-being of the family when with them, the trial court was correct in involuntarily terminating his parental rights. Cabinet for Human Resources v. Rogeski, 909 S.W.2d 660, 1995<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS134" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 134</a></cite> (Ky. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute requires a finding (1) that the child, by clear and convincing evidence, is an abused or neglected child; (2) that the termination would be in the best interest of the child; and (3) that one or more of the factors set out in subsection (1)(a)-(f) (now (2)(a)-(c), (e) and (f)) of this section are present. R. C. R. v. Commonwealth, 988 S.W.2d 36, 1998<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS138" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 138</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).

        Evidence was sufficient to support termination of a mother’s parental rights where the mother had been incarcerated since the birth of the child at issue for reasons directly related to the abuse of an older child, social worker testified that parenting instructions provided did not carry over from one (1) visit to another, and a psychological associate testified that the mother’s history in prison included two (2) suicide attempts and self-mutilation. M.P.S. v. Cabinet for Human Resources ex rel. S.A.S., 979 S.W.2d 114, 1998<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS66" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 66</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before a circuit court may terminate a parent’s rights, it must find, by clear and convincing evidence: (1) that the child is an abused or neglected child, as defined by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020ol11" target="_self">600.020(1)</a></cite>; and (2) that termination would be in the child’s best interest. After that threshold is met, a court must find the existence of one of the numerous grounds recited in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090ol11" target="_self">625.090(1)</a></cite>, including abandonment, infliction of serious physical injury or emotional harm, sexual abuse, or neglect in providing access to basic survival needs, in order to terminate parental rights. Commonwealth v. G.C.W., 139 S.W.3d 172, 2004<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS215" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 215</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court properly terminated the parental rights of a minor mother under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090" target="_self">625.090</a></cite> without receiving expert testimony as to the mother’s parenting potential upon adulthood because §<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090" target="_self">625.090</a></cite>(2)(e), (g) did not require proof that a minor parent would be unable to effectively parent a child when the parent reached the age of majority. Commonwealth v. T.N.H., 302 S.W.3d 658, 2010<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS5" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 5</a></cite> (Ky. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the child’s best interests would be served if the mother’s rights were terminated, given the evidence that (1) the mother did not have stable housing and was dependent on her boyfriend, (2) she did not pay any child support, (3) the child had special needs based on his drug addiction at birth, and (4) the child was in a foster home, and the child recognized the providers as his parents. D.J.D. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 350 S.W.3d 833, 2011<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS259" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 259</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding abandonment, neither parent saw the child for more than one year, neither parent worked on his or her case plan, both had child support arrearages, and there was substantial evidence supporting the trial court’s decision to terminate the parents’
    rights, and this was not clearly erroneous. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS301" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 301</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court found that the Cabinet of Health and Family Services made reasonable efforts to reunite the parents with the child, and considering the neglect and parents’
    lack of insight and lack of progress on their case plans, the trial court properly found that termination was in the child’s best interests. C.J.M. v. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs., 389 S.W.3d 155, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS301" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 301</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by finding that at least on ground listed in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090ol12" target="_self">625.090(2)</a></cite> existed because: (1) at the time of the termination of parental rights hearing the children had been in the custody and control of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services for over 24 months and for a period of not less than six months, and for reasons other than poverty alone; (2) the parents failed to provide essential parental care and protection for the children, including clothing, shelter, medical care, or education; (3) the parents had not had any contact with their children since September 2010; and (4) the parents did not complete all required substance abuse orders and recommendations, individual counseling services, or parenting classes. C.A.W. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 391 S.W.3d 400, 2013<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS24" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 24</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights was proper because the court found that the State had provided all reasonable services; there was ample testimony that both the mother and the children had been offered a number of services throughout the time the children were in foster care and that the services were fully utilized. C.H. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 399 S.W.3d 782, 2013<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS116" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 116</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        It appeared that the trial court relied only on the mother’s incarceration as a ground for termination, but that was just one factor to be considered. M.L.C. v. Cabinet, 411 S.W.3d 761, 2013<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS136" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 136</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of a mother's parental rights was appropriate because a child was found to be abused and neglected based on the infliction of an emotional injury; the child suffered from Reactive Attachment Disorder, and the mother's mental illness made it incapable for her to care for the child. Moreover, the mother inflicted emotional injury to the child, failed to provide adequate parental care and supervision, and failed to provide the essentials of life for the child's overall well-being; termination was in the best interest of the child, reunification efforts were made, and the child's welfare would have improved if termination was ordered. B.E.K. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 487 S.W.3d 457, 2016<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS40" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 40</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not err in determining that the grounds in this section were present after a witness testified that in his professional opinion the mother’s disability was such that she was unlikely to improve to a degree that would permit her to give adequate care to the child and there were no services that would abate the concerns if the child were returned to the mother. Commonwealth v. K.S., 585 S.W.3d 202, 2019<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS382" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 382</a></cite> (Ky. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper because the child was neglected as she was born with amphetamines in her system that came from the mother’s use of amphetamines prescribed to her, but she did not inform her physician of her pregnancy; she continuously abused drugs over the two-year period after the child had been removed; she went from one abusive relationship to another and did not complete her protective parenting class; and she did not pay child support; because there was no reasonable expectation of improvement in the mother’s situation within a reasonable amount of time; and because the child had been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months preceding the filing of the petition to terminate. T.R.W. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 2019<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS223" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 223</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. May 10, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err when it admitted into evidence the files from the dependency, neglect, and abuse proceedings of the child and her three siblings because the trial court made independent findings regarding the child’s neglect based on the testimonial evidence produced at trial and did not simply rely on the dependency, neglect, and abuse adjudications; the abuse or neglect of other children in the family was relevant to the current termination proceedings; and the documents were admissible because they were not excluded by hearsay, and were self-authenticating public documents. T.R.W. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 2019<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS223" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 223</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. May 10, 2019).

        Evidence showing that the defendants’ children lived in a filthy home, suffered from malnutrition, sores and impetigo and were frequently absent from school supported a judgment terminating parental rights. (Decisions under prior law.) Church v. Department for Human Resources, 555 S.W.2d 602, 1977<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS791" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 791</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although incarceration for an isolated criminal offense may not constitute abandonment justifying termination of parental rights, incarceration is a factor to be considered, particularly so where father was incarcerated for the rape of the half-sister of the two (2) children involved. Cabinet for Human Resources v. Rogeski, 909 S.W.2d 660, 1995<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS134" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 134</a></cite> (Ky. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although testimony consisting of children’s out-of-court statements regarding sexual abuse would be improper in a criminal case, in a termination of parental rights action statements were properly admitted as additional evidence of parental conduct. Crum v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 928 S.W.2d 355, 1996<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS134" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 134</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a foster parent does not qualify as an expert witness competent to testify as to the existence of sexual abuse, question posed to foster parent as to whether she believed that the children had been sexually abused was not objectionable nor unfairly prejudicial in bench trial terminating parental rights of mother. Crum v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 928 S.W.2d 355, 1996<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS134" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 134</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in failing to terminate a mother’s parental rights to her four children where, by clear and convincing evidence, the State demonstrated that the children were placed in foster care by the mother because she could not deal with their problems, she had no interaction with them for nearly a year and they were in foster care for over three years, the mother had exposed the children to sexual abuse and exploitation and refused to acknowledge the same, and she was unable and unwilling to care for their needs. Commonwealth v. G.C.W., 139 S.W.3d 172, 2004<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS215" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 215</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order terminating a father’s parental rights was affirmed where, inter alia, father had no contact with the child for several years, and provided no financial support for 31 months; while the father claimed he did not know where to send support payments, the parties’ agreement included the proper address. B.T.R. v. J.W., 148 S.W.3d 294, 2004<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS290" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 290</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that the residences the parents and children lived in were unsanitary and unsafe for human habitation, and that the older child had been sexually abused by his uncles and parents, was sufficient to establish that the children were abused and neglected as defined in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.020ol11" target="_self">600.020(1)</a></cite> and to support the family court’s termination order. Cabinet for Health and Family Servs. v. A.G.G., 190 S.W.3d 338, 2006<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS97" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 97</a></cite> (Ky. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was no substantial evidence to support a finding under either KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090ol11a" target="_self">625.090(1)(a)</a></cite>1. or (a)2., and there was no allegation of criminal charges under subsection (1)(a)3., the family court erred in finding that a child was abused or neglected; thus, as there was no ground supporting termination, the family court abused its discretion in terminating a mother’s parental rights to her daughter. T.G. v. Commonwealth, 2007<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS158" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 158</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 816 (Ky. Ct.

       <p>
        Grant of petition for adoption without the consent of the biological father, who had undergone gender reassignment surgery, was, in effect, a proceeding to terminate the father’s parental rights based on abuse and neglect. The grant was proper because the evidence showed that the minor child suffered major depression, suicidal ideation, a decline in school performance, physical symptoms and withdrawn behavior, and the child testified the child felt abandoned. M.B. v. D.W., 236 S.W.3d 31, 2007<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS346" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 346</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).

        Termination of a mother’s parental rights was proper under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090ol12c" target="_self">625.090(2)(c)</a></cite> as the mother had abused her children or allowed them to be abused by a stepfather. J.M.R. v. Commonwealth, 239 S.W.3d 116, 2007<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS407" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 407</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2007), overruled,

       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of a mother’s and a father’s parental rights was supported by substantial evidence and was in their children’s best interests because there was ongoing domestic violence between the mother and the father and the parents and the children, the parents did little to resolve their drug and alcohol dependency, the parents continuously or repeatedly failed to provide or were incapable of providing essential food, clothing, shelter, medical care or education reasonably necessary and available for the children’s well-being and there was no reasonable expectation of significant improvement in the parents’
    conduct in the immediately foreseeable future, one child was sexually abused by her parents and her uncles, another child was deemed a high suicide risk, and the parents failed to make sufficient progress toward identified goals as set forth in the court-approved case plan which would have allowed for the children’s safe return. C.R.G. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Fam. Servs., 297 S.W.3d 914, 2009<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS215" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 215</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).

        Termination of the mother’s parental rights was improper because the evidence did not show that the child was neglected; while a doctor stated that the mother’s limited intellect gave rise to a risk of neglect, that is not the same as neglect but rather indicates a child is dependent. The mother never had custody of the child, never neglected the child, and complied with her case plan, and while she had developmental disabilities, that alone was insufficient to render her behavior as neglectful.

        Standards governing appellate review require an appellate court to accord considerable deference to the findings of a trial court in a termination of parental rights case.

        Since standard of review in termination of parental rights action was confined to the clearly erroneous standard in CR 52.01, the court applied that standard to custodians’

Substantial evidence supported the family court’s finding that involuntary termination of the children’s biological mother would not be in the children’s best interest, so the standard for involuntary termination under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090" target="_self">625.090</a></cite> was not met.

        The evidence presented buy the Kentucky Cabinet for Family Services was insufficient to support the family court’s findings of medical and educational neglect of the children as the allegations of medical neglect centered on a special needs child and there was no evidence as to why the child missed doctors appointments, there was no evidence as to how much school the children had missed, and the fact that the oldest child was reading at a level far below his grade level did not, in and of itself, indicate parental neglect.

        Circuit court erred in terminating a father’s parental rights based upon willful abandonment and allowing the child’s stepfather to adopt him because the record showed that the mother thwarted the father’s attempts to visit with his son, that the mother treated the father with hostility and resentment, that the mother and her new husband removed the child from Kentucky every Father’s Day, that the father asked his family members to keep in contact with his child and the mother admonished them to stay away from the child, and that the mother never informed the father about the child’s extracurricular activities.

        There was no error in a trial court’s procedure in conducting an evidentiary hearing on an adoption petition and essentially permitting the presentation of a case for the involuntary termination of the nonconsenting biological father’s parental rights under KRS ch. 625 because the substantial provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.090ol12" target="_self">625.090(2)</a></cite> pertaining to the involuntary termination of parental rights were identical to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc199s199.502ol11" target="_blank">199.502(1)</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that an involuntary termination of parental rights action was pending did not prevent the parents from filing a petition for voluntary termination of parental rights, nor did it take away their right to consent to adoption of their child by the child’s paternal grandparents. The fact that they filed their petition before their parental rights were terminated made their voluntary petition timely. Commonwealth v. L.J.P., 316 S.W.3d 871, 2010<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS120" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 120</a></cite> (Ky. 2010).

        Had the mother been present in person to testify, her testimony would have been the same, and thus the court found no error in the trial court’s denial of a continuance in this termination of parental rights case.

       <p>
        Trial court erred in terminating a father's rights to his three minor children because the trial court, inter alia, did not make adequate findings regarding the best interest of the children, did not include any specific written facts to support its conclusion, did not consider whether the father could improve if provided with some level of support or offered the opportunity to complete a parenting plan, allowed the guardian ad litem to provide an evidentiary report, and relied on that report.

       <p>
        Wile the trial court was attempting to provide a mother one last chance to “rebuild her life” before terminating her parental rights, the express statutory procedure did not permit the trial court to “defer” the matter beyond the statutory period where the terms “either” and “or,” combined with the lack of any other alternative outcome in the other parts of the statute, limited the trial court's options following trial and rendered the trial court's selection between these options mandatory.

        Mother's parental rights were properly terminated because the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) was not triggered where the child was not in any way raised in an Indian home or environment and then removed, pursuant to the Existing Indian Family Doctrine; therefore, the beyond a reasonable doubt standard was not appropriate. Moreover, the mother was not prejudiced because the family court did not reach its decision by applying a lesser standard of proof than the clear and convincing standard applicable in non-ICWA cases.

    psychological assessments showed that they could not raise their children without significant help; (2) the Cabinet for Health and Family Services made all reasonable efforts to reunite the children with their parents before filing the termination of parental rights action; (3) the parents did not comply with treatment services; and (4) the children formed a very strong bond with their foster parents; (5) the parents did not provide the children with financial assistance, food, clothing, shelter, medical, or educational care.

        Termination of a mother’s parental rights was in the children’s best interests because the mother suffered from both mental and physical illness that impaired her ability to care for her children, the mother failed to pay child support despite being able to obtain gainful employment, and there was testimony concerning the bruising inflicted by the mother during the second unsupervised visit.

        Family court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the Cabinet for Health and Family Services made reasonable efforts to reunite the father with his son prior to the filing of the termination of parental rights petition because it offered the father opportunities to comply with the case plan, to seek visitation with his son, and to be involved in his therapy.

        Family court had substantial evidence to support its finding that the Cabinet for Health and Family Services had met the son’s physical, emotional, and mental health needs where the son suffered from attachment disorder, sexual abuse, PTSD, ADHD, and neglect and that since his placement with his current foster family he had made vast improvements, both academically and psychologically.

        Bare neglect is not a sufficient statutory ground for a severing of parental rights. (Decisions under prior law.) Jouett v. Rhorer, 339 S.W.2d 865, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS485" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 485</a></cite> (Ky. 1960).

        Where the chancellor found that the mother had both neglected and abandoned the child, her consent was not needed for the adoption. (Decisions under prior law.) Lester v. Looney, 461 S.W.2d 81, 1970<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS606" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 606</a></cite> (Ky. 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, abandonment is demonstrated by facts or circumstances that evince a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child; nonsupport does not itself constitute abandonment, especially where the child is supported by a volunteer, but it may be an element of abandonment. (Decisions under prior law.) O.S. v. C.F., 655 S.W.2d 32, 1983<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS334" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 334</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In adoption proceedings parental rights are not severed merely because a child would have a better home elsewhere or because the natural parent may provide less parental care than the adopting parent, nor are they severed because a parent has temporarily abdicated his parental responsibility in favor of a relative; rather there must be proof that the natural parent has abandoned or neglected the infant as prescribed by the statute. (Decisions under prior law.) O.S. v. C.F., 655 S.W.2d 32, 1983<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS334" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 334</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Abandonment is a matter of intent which may be proved by external facts and circumstances; otherwise, servicemen, prisoners of war, ship captains or persons requiring prolonged hospitalization would be likely candidates to have their parental rights terminated. (Decisions under prior law.) J.H. v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 704 S.W.2d 661, 1985<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS719" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 719</a></cite> (Ky. Ct.

        Where the father was dedicated to a criminal lifestyle which incarcerated him, he substantially and continually neglected the children and it was in the best interest of the children that his parental rights be terminated.

App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether abandonment occurs through incarceration sufficiently to support terminating parental rights must be strictly scrutinized; incarceration alone can never be construed as abandonment as a matter of law. (Decisions under prior law.) J.H. v. Cabinet for Human Resources, 704 S.W.2d 661, 1985<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS719" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 719</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s findings were insufficient to support its conclusions that mother abandoned or neglected her child, where mother’s separation from the child was the result of her mental and emotional problems, for which she had sought and continued to receive treatment, and her failure to provide support was due to her inability to work due to her mental problems. (Decisions under prior law.) D.S. v. F.A.H., 684 S.W.2d 320, 1985<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS516" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 516</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the children’s health was unquestionably harmed when they were allowed to be hungry and unclothed, to run around with infected wounds, and to have obvious serious physical conditions go undetected and untreated, the trial court had no choice but to find abuse and neglect exercised upon these children by their respective parents and the court did not terminate parental rights on the basis of poverty alone. (Decisions under prior law.) V.S. v. Commonwealth, Cabinet for Human Resources, 706 S.W.2d 420, 1986<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS1069" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 1069</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of a father's parental rights on the ground of abandonment was inappropriate because, although the father did not visit with and support the child after the child was placed in foster care, the failures by the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services denied the father an opportunity to maintain contact with the child and to work toward a court-approved case plan to regain custody. Furthermore, the oral parenting plan given to the father was so lacking in formality and detail that it did not constitute a plan.
    H.M.R. v. Cabinet, 521 S.W.3d 221, 2017<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS157" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 157</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding that the father had abandoned the child for a period of 90 days where the father testified that he had not attempted to contact, support or visit the child since the child was placed in temporary custody, the father was not incarcerated for nearly three months of the temporary custody period, and the father failed to comply with court orders. M.P.R. v. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs., 520 S.W.3d 409, 2017<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS219" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 219</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of the father’s parental rights was proper because he abandoned his children based on his total failure to provide child support, a birthday card, a Christmas toy, a meal, or even stroll with them around a park, and a few phone calls did not offset the father visiting with the children only twice in the span of a year; the father did not provide his children essential parental care and protection as he did not have regular contact with the children while in Kentucky, or buy them food, toys, or clothing; he did not provide essentials necessary for his children’s well-being; and there was no reasonable expectation of improvement or significant improvement in the immediately foreseeable future. K.M.E. v. Commonwealth, 565 S.W.3d 648, 2018<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS270" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 270</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence did not show a mother abandoned her children because (1) she left the children with an improper caregiver for under 90 days, (2) nothing showed she could contact the children from prison, (3) the Cabinet For Health and Family Services barred her contact, (4) her minor crimes were insufficient to terminate parental rights, and (5) she completed case plan parts she could while in prison, so no settled purpose to forego parental duties and relinquish parental claims was shown.

        Even though a father's incarceration could have been considered, the fact and length of his incarceration, without more, could not have supported the finding of abandonment necessary for an involuntary termination of his parental rights under this statute. The father had a positive involvement with the child and the family prior to his incarceration; moreover, while in prison, he completed his General Equivalency Degree, he participated in educational and drug-treatment programs, and he maintained visitation with the child.

       If the Circuit Court determines that parental rights are to be terminated involuntarily in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, it shall enter an order that the termination of parental rights and the transfer of custody are in the best interest of the child, and that each petitioner is fully aware of the purpose of the proceedings and the consequences of the provisions of this chapter. The order shall terminate all parental rights and obligations of such parent and release the child from all legal obligations to such parent and vest care and custody of the child in such person, agency, or cabinet as the court believes best qualified.

        The statutory reasons underlying the termination process relate to parental abandonment, neglect and abuse so substantial that the child must be legally cut off from the parent. They justify a legal structure that provides finality and blocks every path to further litigation to reestablish a connection to parents whose rights have been terminated. Litigation by grandparents, by the family of such parents, would frustrate and circumvent the termination decree. The statutory language of severance required in the termination decree now expresses no exception, and none may be created by implying an exception from the grandparents’ visitation statute. Hicks v. Enlow, 764 S.W.2d 68, 1989<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS8" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 8</a></cite> (Ky. 1989).

        Where natural father voluntarily terminated his parental rights to a daughter born out of wedlock, he had no legal relationship to the child and, therefore, no standing to challenge her adoption.

        A mother of a handicapped child had failed to obtain legal authority to fund and manage a trust, which was funded by a settlement received from those allegedly responsible for the child’s condition, as she was not appointed by the District Court, did not obtain approval of the trust, failed to file settlements or accountings, and administered the trust with no court supervision and control; nevertheless, her ex-husband was not entitled to half of the trust funds upon the child’s death under the laws of descent and devise because his parental rights had been previously terminated.

        The overriding considerations expressed through the termination and adoption statutes for cutting, finally and irrevocably, all connections to the biological parent and his family where there has been a final order terminating parental rights and where there has been an adoption introducing the child into a new family, simply do not apply where there has been only a stepparent adoption with no prior legal severance of the bond to the grandparents.

        Paternal grandparents were awarded visitation rights, under the “best interest of the child” standard, where the granddaughter’s father had died and the granddaughter was subsequently adopted by her stepfather.

        Paternal grandmother whose son’s parental rights to an infant were terminated on the basis of abandonment for a period exceeding five (5) years, was not entitled to visitation rights.

        Paternal grandparents of children whose parents died and who were then adopted by a maternal first cousin and her spouse, had no legal relationship with their grandchildren and thus were not awarded visitation rights.

        Because KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.100" target="_self">625.100</a></cite> specifically recognized that persons related to a child had an elevated status when custody of the child was awarded after a termination of the parents’
    rights, and because the grandparents had a legally cognizable interest in the child, they could intervene as a matter of right in the custody determination. L.J.P. v.

        Because an indigent mother and father were not afforded counsel at a goal change hearing held before the District Court, as well as during other critical stages of the dependency action, an order terminating their parental rights was improper, as such detrimentally affected the termination proceeding before the Circuit Court when the court made an erroneous finding of fact that the child had been in foster care for 15 of the preceding 22 months.

        Though petitions by childrens’
    custodians to adopt the children despite their biological mother’s withholding of consent necessitated an order of involuntary termination of parental rights, and though KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc625s625.110" target="_self">625.110</a></cite> prohibited appeals from orders denying involuntary termination of parental right, that general prohibition was overcome by the specific statutory authority of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc199s199.560" target="_blank">199.560</a></cite> that allowed appeals of orders denying adoption petitions.

        It was error for the family court to adjudicate the juvenile’s status as an habitual truant from school and to place the juvenile under the authority of the Department of Community Based Services when the juvenile was not present at the adjudication or the disposition hearing. Determinations in the juvenile’s absence violated his due process rights.

        Court had no subject matter jurisdiction in truancy cases because (1) home conditions were described in required forms as “no visible barriers to attendance,” which was too ambiguous to ascertain what was meant and did not meet a statutory requirement to acquaint students' schools with home conditions, (2) many areas of the form were left blank, and (3) a court's speculative statement that the court “bet” a school had made attempts to assist a student and family as statutorily required before filing a complaint showed the court did not know if the school had done what was necessary to invoke the court's jurisdiction.

        Juvenile’s disposition was reversed because, when the trial court rejected a recommendation to continue the juvenile’s dispositional hearing and committed the juvenile over counsel’s objection, (1) the juvenile did not receive a dispositional hearing that satisfied statutory requirements or the due process right to a meaningful and fair proceeding, even though the juvenile was before the court for habitual truancy, as due process attached to status offenses, and (2) the denial was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

        A 17-year-old juvenile convicted of first degree manslaughter, but mentally ill, qualifies as an adult offender under this section because he committed a felony with a firearm, so is subject to the same penalties as an adult pursuant to RCr 3.07. Thus, the protection KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc640s640.040ol13" target="_self">640.040(3)</a></cite> offers youthful offenders against the limitation on probation set out in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc533s533.060ol11" target="_blank">533.060(1)</a></cite> is withdrawn by this section.

        Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth's petition for a writ of mandamus because the Commonwealth did not have an adequate remedy by appeal; the district court's denial of the motion to transfer defendant juvenile to circuit court was an interlocutory order because further proceedings were necessary in district court to dispose of all the issues in the case.

        Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth a writ of mandamus after a district court denied its motion to transfer defendant juvenile because the Commonwealth demonstrated a substantial miscarriage of justice would result if the district court was proceeding erroneously and correction of the error was necessary and appropriate in the interest of orderly judicial administration; the mandatory findings under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc640s640.010" target="_self">640.010(</a></cite>2)(a) can be the proper subject of a writ of mandamus. D.M.K. v.

        Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth a writ of mandamus and ordered a district court to find probable cause for first-degree wanton endangerment because the district court applied the wrong legal standard, and it abused its discretion in finding that probable cause only existed for second-degree wanton endangerment; the grand jury, not the district court, was charged with the task of determining whether defendant juvenile was properly charged with a felony or misdemeanor.

        Subsection (4) of this section, as amended in 1994 to require a child over the age of 14 being charged with a felony involving the use of a firearm be tried in Circuit Court as an adult defendant, does not violate Ky.

        Circuit court judge was ordered to provide members of the media with a copy of the recording of a criminal arraignment and to refrain from closing any future proceeding that was ordinarily open to the public and from sealing records because he failed to conduct a hearing and closed the arraignment without making specific finding or considering less restrictive measures; the judge’s reliance on the statutory protections closing hearings was error because they were not applicable.

        When the juvenile does not directly use the firearm but is charged with a complicity offense, the record must reflect sufficient evidence to show probable cause that complicity has occurred. Since this review occurs at the charging stage rather than at a trial of guilt or innocence, this means that there must be allegations that, if true, would support a probable cause finding that the juvenile acted with the kind of culpability with respect to the result that is sufficient for the commission of the offense when she solicited or conspired with others, aided in planning or committing the offense, or failed to prevent the offense when legally required to do so. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS4" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 4</a></cite> (Ky. 2012).

Use of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument to cause serious physical injury is the necessary element that separates first- and second-degree assault. However, to support first-degree assault by complicity, the proof in a youthful offender transfer hearing must further establish allegations that the accused was indeed complicit. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS4" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 4</a></cite> (Ky. 2012).

        KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite> provides that transfer is mandatory when a firearm is used in commission of the underlying offense; by treating offenses in which a firearm is used differently, the General Assembly has declared a different public policy, one of essentially no tolerance of gun-related crimes by juveniles, and in light of that policy, it would be unjust to allow a juvenile who has used a firearm to avoid prosecution as a youthful offender. If the district court errs in finding that the gun was not used by a juvenile, then it fails to comply with the mandate of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite>, which creates a risk that the administration of justice will suffer; in such a case, a writ of mandamus would be appropriate. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS4" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 4</a></cite> (Ky. 2012).

        Application of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite> to a juvenile charged with complicity to a felony must first focus on the strong language of this section, which mandates that a child charged with a felony in which a firearm, whether functional or not, was used in the commission of the offense, must be transferred to the circuit court for trial as an adult; while the statute includes some other qualifiers that are important, the language sets forth the legislative intent to place juveniles who are involved in gun crimes in a different position than other public offenders. This is sometimes referred to as an automatic transfer rule, but that is only true if all the statutory elements are met: there must be probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed a felony, that a firearm was used in commission of that felony, and that the juvenile was 14 years of age or older at the time of the commission of the alleged felony. KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite>, and yet the seriousness with which the legislature regards the use of guns by juveniles is clearly presented. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS4" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 4</a></cite> (Ky. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a gun is used in the commission of a felony, the district court’s first inquiry must be whether that use was by the juvenile directly or whether the use can be attributed to the juvenile. When the juvenile is charged as a principal, that is, having directly committed the charged offense and used a gun in the process, this inquiry is relatively simple. For example, first-degree assault is the criminal offense in this case involving a firearm. The first-degree assault statute, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc508s508.010" target="_blank">508.010</a></cite>, requires that a defendant must intentionally cause serious physical injury by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS4" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 4</a></cite> (Ky. 2012).

       <p>
        To be transferred under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite>, the child must at least be complicit in another person’s use of a firearm. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS4" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 4</a></cite> (Ky. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Transfer statute requires that, if a juvenile defendant is charged with a felony, the juvenile shall be transferred to circuit court if a firearm was used in the commission of the offense; all this requires is that there be a felony charge and that a firearm be used in commission of the felony. Further, there is no language in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite> stating that the firearm must actually be used by the juvenile charged; rather, the statute only requires that the firearm be used in the commission of the felony the juvenile is charged with, not that the juvenile was the one who wielded the firearm. Because the transfer language in the statute is mandatory and because of the obvious policy the legislature has expressed with regard to juveniles using firearms in crimes, complicity to commit an offense involving use of a firearm requires transfer when an offense involving direct use of a firearm would. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS4" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 4</a></cite> (Ky. 2012).

       <p>
        That a firearm offense committed by means of complicity can be the basis of transfer under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite> does not mean that all such charged offenses must be transferred; the charge alone does not decide whether a transfer occurs. Pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite>, transfer only occurs for such charges if, following a preliminary hearing, the district court finds probable cause to believe that the child committed a felony, that a firearm was used in the commission of that felony, and that the child was fourteen years of age or older at the time of the commission of the alleged felony. K.R. v. Commonwealth, 360 S.W.3d 179, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS4" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 4</a></cite> (Ky. 2012).

        Circuit court did not err by granting a petition for writ of mandamus directing the district court to transfer appellant juvenile’s robbery case to the circuit court, because the conditions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite> were satisfied. Appellant was older than 14 years of age and there was probable cause to believe that he was a participant in a crime in which a gun was used, because he was in the vehicle at the time of the robbery and had proceeds from the robbery on his person at the time of arrest.

        Entry of a guilty plea did not preclude the consideration of whether a transfer order in a juvenile case was facially invalid, and a waiver rule did not apply to a facially insufficient transfer order.

        Defendant was no longer under the juvenile system and therefore his motion under RCr P. 11.42 failed to the extent it argued that it was error for the juvenile court to accept a waiver from counsel, resulting in transfer to the circuit court for trial as a youthful offender.

        While the term “public offender” is not expressly defined, a public offender is a juvenile who commits a public offense action. Public offenders are adjudicated rather than convicted.

        Firearm enhanced drug offense is actually charged at the higher level regardless of the procedural circumstances. Therefore, a circuit court properly acquired jurisdiction in a juvenile case because transfer order was facially valid where a district court found probable cause that appellant committed the offense of drug trafficking with a firearm enhancement; moreover, the trial court made two sets of findings, one concerning mandatory findings and one about the discretionary factors.

    KRS §<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020" target="_self">635.020(</a></cite>4) is constitutional and does not violate the equal protection clause because there is a rational basis for the statutory classification, and the statute does not violate the fair hearing requirement of case law and due process; thus, the court rejected defendant’s claim to the contrary, given that a preliminary hearing was held after which the trial court found probable cause to believe that defendant was 14 years of age when defendant committed a felony.

     Options of court at dispositional hearing.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If in its decree the juvenile court finds that the child comes within the purview of this chapter, the court, at the dispositional hearing, may impose any combination of the following, except that the court shall, if a validated risk and needs assessment tool is available, consider the validated risk and needs assessment submitted to the court and parties by the Department of Juvenile Justice or other agency before imposing any disposition:

     <ol>

       </span>
       Order the child or his parents, guardian, or person exercising custodial control to make restitution or reparation to any injured person to the extent, in the sum and upon the conditions as the court determines. However, no parent, guardian, or person exercising custodial control shall be ordered to make restitution or reparation unless the court has provided notice of the hearing, provided opportunity to be heard, and made a finding that the person’s failure to exercise reasonable control or supervision was a substantial factor in the child’s delinquency;

    At the time the child is placed on probation, the court shall explain to the child the sanctions which may be imposed if the court’s conditions are violated, and shall include notice of those sanctions as part of its written order of probation. A child placed on probation shall be subject to the visitation and supervision of a probation officer or an employee of the Department of Juvenile Justice.<li class="p6" id="tLIc635s635.060ol12bb2">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    The conditions of probation shall include authorization for the use of graduated sanctions prior to a court review for the imposition of a term of detention. If the court has previously imposed graduated sanctions for a violation of conditions of supervision by a child monitored by the court, or makes a finding that the graduated sanctions have previously been imposed for a child on probation, then the court may impose a sanction of up to thirty (30) days’ detention for a violation of the conditions of supervision or probation. A court may not impose detention prior to use of graduated sanctions unless there is clear and convincing evidence that there are no graduated sanctions available that are appropriate for the child and the child is an immediate threat to himself or others. Except where commitment has been probated pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, a child may not be committed or recommitted to the Department of Juvenile Justice for a violation of a condition of probation.

        The juvenile court did not have the authority to sentence an eighteen (18) year-old defendant to confinement in a juvenile facility for a car theft committed prior to the defendant’s eighteenth birthday. Jefferson County Dep't for Human Services v. Carter, 795 S.W.2d 59, 1990<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS73" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 73</a></cite> (Ky. 1990).

        Under subsection (5) of this section, a juvenile public offender may not be committed to a secure juvenile detention facility for more than 90 days, even if the offender is charged with multiple incidents of criminal behavior. Commonwealth v. W.E.B., 985 S.W.2d 344, 1998<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS170" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 170</a></cite> (Ky. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court was without authority to order the juveniles confined in adult detention facilities for public offenses which they committed before they reached the age of 18; since KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.060ol12" target="_self">635.060(2)</a></cite>, (3) expressly envisioned situations beyond the 18th birthday, it was clear that the only authorized dispositions for the juveniles were either placement on probation, home incarceration, or supervision for a period not to exceed 1 year, sentencing the juveniles to adult detention facilities was not within the parameters of the authorized dispositions. D.R.T. v. Commonwealth, 111 S.W.3d 392, 2002<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS2031" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 2031</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2002).

        KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.060ol14" target="_self">635.060(4)</a></cite> provided that a juvenile offender who was older than age 14 but younger than age 16 could be confined for a period not to exceed 45 days but KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.060" target="_self">600.060</a></cite> stated that notwithstanding any other provision of KRS Chs. 600 to 645, the inherent contempt power of the court was not diminished, so, because KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc600s600.060" target="_self">600.060</a></cite> specifically addressed the juvenile court’s contempt powers, it controlled over the more general limitation on sentencing of public offenders contained in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.060ol14" target="_self">635.060(4)</a></cite>, and a juvenile court was allowed to sentence a public offender to 60 days in detention for being in contempt of court. A.W. v. Commonwealth, 2003<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS91" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 91</a></cite> (Ky. Ct.

        Order modifying the amount of restitution that a juvenile was directed to pay was affirmed because KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.010ol113" target="_self">610.010(13)</a></cite> granted the juvenile court continuing jurisdiction to review a previously entered restitution order. Further, the order was not untimely as CR 59.05 did not apply to the entry of the dispositional order. D.F. v.

        Since KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.060ol14" target="_self">635.060(4)</a></cite>, (5), restricts the dispositional option to a child 14 or older, and thus, any child under the age of 14 is not allowed to be placed in detention, the dispositional order imposing 15 days in detention for a 13-year-old juvenile was improper, despite the fact that the detention was probated. N.T.G. v. Commonwealth, 185 S.W.3d 218, 2006<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS51" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 51</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).

        Where charges against juvenile for third-degree burglary and second-degree criminal mischief were raised to second-degree and first-degree, respectively, after commencement of the trial, but in both cases complaints clearly stated facts to support the raised charges, and where juvenile proceeding took place under the Unified Juvenile Code which makes no distinctions between felonies and misdemeanors, such defects were not tantamount to an additional or different offense, and did not mislead the defendant or cause him to suffer any prejudice.

        Minors are permitted to waive any of the rights set out in the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code, unless otherwise provided, so long as the minor, by the express terms of a plea agreement, validly and knowingly waives the rights, including the right to be sentenced under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.060" target="_self">635.060</a></cite>. However, a juvenile defendant can not be found to impliedly waive a right to which the defendant was not explicitly made aware. Kozak v.

        When it was found, under RCr P. 11.42, that defendant received ineffective assistance at a juvenile transfer hearing, defendant could not receive a new transfer hearing because, while defendant was presumptively prejudiced by counsel’s abdication of responsibility to defendant at a critical stage of the proceedings, (1) a juvenile court adjudication would not benefit defendant due to defendant’s advanced age, and (2) de novo review of the propriety of transfer was foreclosed under the law of the case doctrine, as the Kentucky Supreme Court decided the issue on direct appeal.

       <p>
        When a juvenile was adjudicated for being complicit in criminal mischief, it was not plain error to hold the juvenile solely liable for restitution for the resulting damage because (1) KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.060" target="_self">635.060</a></cite> granted such discretion, (2) an interpretation of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc533s533.030" target="_blank">533.030</a></cite> granting such authority in adult cases applied to juvenile cases, and (3) the order did not contravene the Juvenile Code’s purposes or affect the juvenile’s substantial rights, nor was the order issued at a shocking or jurisprudentially intolerable proceeding. R.S. v. Commonwealth, 423 S.W.3d 178, 2014<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS6" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 6</a></cite> (Ky. 2014).

         9. "Involving a deadly weapon."
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly determined that the plain meaning of the phrase, “involving a deadly weapon,” in the statute at issue was broad enough to include both the use and possession of a deadly weapon because, in common usage, “to involve” meant “to include,” as used in the statute, the plain meaning of the phrase was that a deadly weapon was present during or somehow included in the commission of an act, and the statute allowed the juvenile court options, one of which is committing a child to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice. R.T. v. Commonwealth, 583 S.W.3d 1, 2018<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS265" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 265</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).

        Circuit court was correct to affirm the juvenile court’s decision committing defendant juvenile to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) because a plain reading and straightforward application of subsection (4)(a)(1) revealed the juvenile court had the authority to commit defendant to the DJJ; because defendant had three prior adjudications, the juvenile court had the authority to commit him to the DJJ for the fourth adjudication. L.H. v. Commonwealth, 2019<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS89" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 89</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. May 17, 2019).

       <p>
        Circuit court was correct to affirm the juvenile court’s decision committing defendant juvenile to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) because subsection (4)(a)(1) gave the juvenile court the authority to commit defendant to the DJJ; the decision to conserve judicial resources by holding one disposition hearing to dispose of all four adjudications in no way impacted the nature and character of the prior adjudications because they remained separate and distinct adjudications. L.H. v. Commonwealth, 2019<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS89" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 89</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. May 17, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant juvenile had the requisite criminal history prior to disposition, satisfying the purpose underlying subsection (4)(a)(1), because he repeatedly engaged in disruptive, volatile behavior resulting in the Commonwealth filing multiple petitions against him, which resulted in multiple misdemeanor or Class D felony adjudications; defendant demonstrated an unwillingness to live within the parameters of the law.

     Discharge from commitment or guardianship.
      </span>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Department of Juvenile Justice may discharge the child from commitment after providing fourteen (14) days’ prior written notice to the committing court, to the legal representative of the child, and to the county attorney of the county in which the committing court presides, which may object to the discharge by holding a court review under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc610s610.120" target="_self">610.120</a></cite>. During the period of commitment or placement, the court may review a dispositional order and may continue or terminate such order as the court deems essential to the best interests of the child.

        Where the Juvenile Court obtained exclusive jurisdiction over the case upon the filing of the juvenile petition two days before defendant’s eighteenth birthday, and where no transfer hearing occurred and the petition was still pending at the time of the indictment, the Circuit Court never had jurisdiction to try the matter.

        Once a juvenile court assumes jurisdiction of an alleged offense committed by a juvenile, the court must either adjudicate the matter or conduct a hearing and transfer the case to Circuit Court.

        A juvenile who was the ringleader in a brutal murder and had previously spent time in a juvenile institution for car theft was properly transferred to the Circuit Court for trial.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a juvenile court hearing confined itself solely to the determination whether the case should be transferred to the Circuit Court, the subsequent trial in the Circuit Court did not subject the defendant to double jeopardy. (Decided under prior law) Sharp v. Commonwealth, 559 S.W.2d 727, 1977<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS558" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 558</a></cite> (Ky. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The transfer of a juvenile accused of murder and robbery to Circuit Court was proper where the juvenile court found that the offenses were committed against persons rather than property, that the offenses had sufficient prosecutive merit to warrant transfer to Circuit Court and that the offenses were aggressive, premeditated, willful and committed without remorse. (Decided under prior law) Mayes v. Commonwealth, 563 S.W.2d 4, 1978<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS335" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 335</a></cite> (Ky. 1978).

       <p>
        Where it was contended that there were irregularities in the appointment of the commissioner who heard the case in juvenile court and ordered the defendants waived to the grand jury to be dealt with as adults, but the order of transfer was signed by the regular juvenile judge in the orders of the day, the order was valid.

       </p>
       <p>
        Due process requires that the reasons for a transfer of a juvenile case to the Circuit Court be stated with particularity in order to permit meaningful review, but unless appellate review is sought it cannot be claimed that the transfer order is void.

       <p>
        The juvenile court did not err in transferring a rape and robbery case to the Circuit Court where the evidence showed that the defendant was 17 and one-half years old at the time the offenses were committed, that the defendant had a record of other juvenile offenses, that there was no adequate manner to protect the public from the defendant, and that there were no adequate facilities in which the defendant could have been committed so as to afford a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation.

        It was not error to indict and convict the defendant of first-degree burglary, or to use that offense as an aggravating circumstance authorizing the death penalty, notwithstanding that he had not been charged with that offense in juvenile court, since it is the offender, rather than the offense, which is transferred to Circuit Court.

        Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth's petition for a writ of mandamus because the Commonwealth did not have an adequate remedy by appeal; the district court's denial of the motion to transfer defendant juvenile to circuit court was an interlocutory order because further proceedings were necessary in district court to dispose of all the issues in the case.

        Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth's petition for a writ of mandamus after a district court denied its motion to transfer defendant juvenile because the Commonwealth demonstrated a substantial miscarriage of justice would result if the district court was proceeding erroneously and correction of the error was necessary and appropriate in the interest of orderly judicial administration; the mandatory findings under subsection (2)(a) can be the proper subject of a writ of mandamus.

       <p>
        Circuit court properly granted the Commonwealth a writ of mandamus and ordered a district court to find probable cause for first-degree wanton endangerment because the district court applied the wrong legal standard, and it abused its discretion in finding that probable cause only existed for second-degree wanton endangerment; the grand jury, not the district court, was charged with the task of determining whether defendant juvenile was properly charged with a felony or misdemeanor. D.M.K. v. Calvert, 2017<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS429" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 429</a></cite> (Ky. Ct.

       <p>
        Legislature's use of the broader term “offense” in subsection (2)(a), rather than the specific term “felony,” indicates that the district court's probable-cause determination should be focused on whether there is probable cause to support the named offense; but in cases where the offense can be prosecuted as either a felony or a misdemeanor, the district court is not responsible for determining whether there is probable cause for the felony charge. D.M.K. v. Calvert, 2017<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS429" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 429</a></cite> (Ky. Ct.

        Circuit court judge was ordered to provide members of the media with a copy of the recording of a criminal arraignment and to refrain from closing any future proceeding that was ordinarily open to the public and from sealing records because he failed to conduct a hearing and closed the arraignment without making specific finding or considering less restrictive measures; the statutory confidentiality protections had been exhausted and were inapplicable.

        Circuit court did not err by granting a petition for writ of mandamus directing the district court to transfer appellant juvenile’s robbery case to the circuit court, because the conditions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite> were satisfied. The district court was not at liberty to proceed under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc640s640.010" target="_self">640.010</a></cite>, because the exercise of its discretion was not an option as appellant was charged with a firearm felony and transfer was mandatory under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.020ol14" target="_self">635.020(4)</a></cite>.

        Where transfer order from juvenile court failed to set forth reasons for the court’s waiver of jurisdiction and made no finding that the best interests of the child and of the public required that the child be tried and disposed of under the regular criminal law, the order did not conform to former statutory requirements and also violated the basic requirements of due process and fairness.

        Where a juvenile court judge, upon entering an order transferring jurisdiction over a defendant to Circuit Court for trial as an adult, fails to enter findings that such transfer is in the “best interests” of the child, the question of deprivation of due process should be raised on appeal or brought to the attention of the judge, or, in special circumstances, for example where counsel does not realize the nature of the constitutional violation before the time to appeal has expired, a collateral attack should be brought under RCr 11.42, in spite of a failure to appeal.

        Where a defendant was 17 days short of his eighteenth birthday on the date the crime was committed, and the juvenile court failed to make a finding, in its order transferring jurisdiction to the Circuit Court, that being tried as an adult was in the defendant’s “best interests” the transfer order was technically defective and violative of due process for failure to comply with the state’s statutory protections; the decision was remanded to the District Court to determine if the juvenile court judge, upon being apprised of the omission, would not have changed his decision and reasserted his jurisdiction under the circumstances. (Decided under prior law) Crick v. Smith, 650 F.2d 860, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 12358 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.1981" target="_blank">Ky. 1981</a></cite>), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 922, 102 S. Ct. 1281, 71 L.

        Before the juvenile court may waive jurisdiction over a juvenile offender either the waiver order, an accompanying statement, or the juvenile court record must include (1) a showing that the juvenile had a hearing at which he was represented by counsel and (2) a statement of the reasons for the transfer which are specific enough to permit meaningful review for the purpose of determining whether there has been compliance with this section. (Decided under prior law) Bingham v. Commonwealth, 550 S.W.2d 535, 1977<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS440" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 440</a></cite> (Ky. 1977).

       <p>
        Where the order of the juvenile court waiving jurisdiction neither revealed that a hearing was held or that the juvenile was represented by counsel nor set forth sufficient reasons for the waiver or even state that the waiver was in the best interests of the juvenile and the public, the order was invalid.

       <p>
        Where the order of transfer of jurisdiction from the juvenile court to the Circuit Court did not contain a finding that “the best interests of the child and the public require that the child be tried and disposed of under regular law governing crimes,” the order of transfer of jurisdiction was valid when made and did not retroactively become invalid. (Decided under prior law) Fields v. Commonwealth, 498 S.W.2d 130, 1973<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS286" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 286</a></cite> (Ky. 1973).

        In consideration of the juvenile court’s waiver order transferring jurisdiction, either the waiver order, an accompanying statement, or the juvenile court record must include a showing that the juvenile had a hearing at which he was represented by counsel and a statement of the reasons for the transfer which are specific enough to permit meaningful review. (Decided under prior law) Hubbs v. Commonwealth, 511 S.W.2d 664, 1974<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS504" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 504</a></cite> (Ky. 1974); Schooley v.

       </p>
       <p>
        When the validity of a transfer order is raised on direct appeal, it is reasonable to require that the reasons for transfer be stated explicitly rather than inferred from the record, but where the challenge is raised on a motion under RCr 11.42 the error must be of such magnitude as to render the judgment of conviction so fundamentally unfair as to constitute a denial of due process and, accordingly, where a transfer order was apparently based on the contents of a welfare worker’s report, and the juvenile was 25 years old by the time of the hearing on an untimely motion, there was no denial of due process justifying the court in setting aside the conviction.

        In proceeding under former law on habitual criminals, failure of counsel to assert invalidity of transfer proceedings from juvenile court in prior felony case constituted a denial of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel where the deficiencies in the transfer proceedings were manifest from the face of the juvenile court order and would have eliminated the use of the prior conviction in the habitual criminal proceedings. (Decided under prior law) Canary v. Bland, 583 F.2d 887, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 9181 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.1978" target="_blank">Ky. 1978</a></cite>).

        Under former habitual criminal law, the failure to timely assert a constitutional challenge to the validity of transfer proceedings from juvenile court resulting in a previous conviction foreclosed reliance upon the same claim in a federal habeas corpus proceeding challenging the habitual criminal conviction absent a showing of cause and prejudice.

        The transfer of a juvenile to Circuit Court for trial as a youthful offender was proper, notwithstanding that his crimes involved property rather than people, where (1) the juvenile was charged with two Class D felonies and with two misdemeanors, (2) the record reflected that, despite his considerable exposure to juvenile court, his criminal misconduct was escalating, and (3) while these charges were pending, he was involved in yet another crime. Stout v. Commonwealth, 44 S.W.3d 781, 2000<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS86" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 86</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2000).

        Firearm enhanced drug offense is actually charged at the higher level regardless of the procedural circumstances. Therefore, a circuit court properly acquired jurisdiction in a juvenile case because transfer order was facially valid where a district court found probable cause that appellant committed the offense of drug trafficking with a firearm enhancement; moreover, the trial court made two sets of findings, one concerning mandatory findings and one about the discretionary factors.

        The Circuit Court erred in directing the Division of Probation and Parole to prepare the presentence investigation report as the statute designates that this duty be performed by the Department of Juvenile Justice in cases involving youthful offenders.

        Defendant was not afforded an opportunity to controvert the evidence against him in his youthful offender’s sentencing hearing; the trial court should have applied the same procedures as applied in an adult sentencing hearing.

The inmate’s petition was therefore timely because it was filed within one year after that sentence was imposed, and the fact that the inmate’s claims related to the earlier juvenile proceedings did not mean that the one-year limitations period should be imposed from the date that the inmate was placed in juvenile custody.

        Unpublished decision:
    Federal trial court did not err in summarily denying petitioner’s application for writ of habeas corpus because his counsel did not err in not objecting when petitioner was sentenced as an adult, even though he was only 17-years-old when he committed his crimes; petitioner was properly sentenced as an adult because he received individualized consideration before being held to stand trial as an adult and was subject to the same sentence as an adult because he pled guilty, which meant that his counsel did not provide ineffective assistance in not objecting to the proper rulings of the trial court.

        There is neither a historical nor a modern societal consensus forbidding the imposition of capital punishment on any person who murders at 16 or 17 years of age, and such punishment does not offend the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.

        Where a juvenile who had been charged with a capital offense was transferred to Circuit Court as a youthful offender where she was acquitted on the capital charge, and convicted of a Class C felony, the trial court was without authority to sentence her pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc640s640.030" target="_self">640.030</a></cite>, but was limited to the much more lenient dispositions provided by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc635s635.060" target="_self">635.060</a></cite>.

        Although the trial court erred by including the sentencing consideration of life without the benefit of probation or parole, a sentencing option in violation of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc640s640.040ol11" target="_self">640.040(1)</a></cite>, the error was harmless where a youthful defendant ultimately received a statutorily authorized sentence for intentional murder, i.e., life without parole for twenty-five (25) years.

        This section is a clear legislative pronouncement that youthful offenders shall not be subject to certain dispositions and defendant’s contention that the legislature made a mistake by failing in subsection (3) of this section to except youthful offenders from the prohibitions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc532s532.045" target="_blank">532.045</a></cite> was disingenuous and defendant was barred from consideration for probation pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc532s532.045" target="_blank">532.045</a></cite>(2).

        A juvenile offender’s sentence of life without the possibility of parole for twenty-five (25) years was permissible under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tLIc640s640.040ol13" target="_self">640.040(3)</a></cite> because the limitations on probation and parole were imposed by the sentence and not as a function of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc533s533.060" target="_blank">533.060</a></cite> or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.40.html#tXXXXc439s439.3401" target="_blank">439.3401</a></cite>; therefore, at the juvenile offender’s 18-year-old hearing, the trial court did not have the option of ordering probation or conditional discharge, nor did it have the ability to return him to juvenile custody to complete a treatment program. By virtue of the sentence itself, the trial court’s only option was to transfer the offender to adult custody. Commonwealth v.
