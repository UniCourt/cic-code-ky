        A vested remainder is a fixed interest to take effect in enjoyment after a particular estate is spent, and is an actual estate which may be sold and the title passed to the purchaser, but a contingent remainder is one limited so as to depend on some event or condition, which is uncertain and may never happen or be performed.

        Remainders are contingent when the estate is limited to take effect either to a dubious and uncertain person or upon a dubious and uncertain event. Ford v. Jones, 223 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 327</cite>, 3 S.W.2d 781, 1927 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 961</cite> (Ky. 1927).

        A devise of a contingent remainder of any kind is the subject of a sale and conveyance, but the purchaser will receive nothing unless the contingent remainderman survives until the event occurs upon which his estate vests.

       <p>
        A life estate is one thing and power to convey remainder another although both are acquired by the same deed and a deed purporting to convey fee simple title would pass the life estate under power of conveyance subject to liens of creditors and would pass the remainder under power of sale. Roby v. Arterburn, 269 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 816</cite>, 108 S.W.2d 873, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 672</cite> (Ky. 1937).

       <p>
        In this jurisdiction, where title to property can be conveyed by deed but use and possession retained until a future time, it seems that delivery of deed to a third person, to be delivered to grantee at grantor’s death, can be construed to be the passing of the present interest in title of subject of deed and retention by grantor of use and possession during his life, and when deed is delivered to grantee, as between parties to it and their privies, it will relate back for purpose of vesting title to delivery of deed to third person for grantee. Kirby v. Hulette, 174 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 257</cite>, 192 S.W. 63, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 187</cite> (Ky. 1917).

        A homestead right is not an estate in land, but is an exemption from execution; it can attach to any real property that can be seized under an execution and the nature or quantum of the estate in which the homestead is claimed is immaterial, as a fee-simple title is not necessary to the right of homestead. Howard v. Mitchell, 268 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 429</cite>, 105 S.W.2d 128, 1936 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 775</cite> (Ky. 1936).

       </p>
       <p>
        A life estate may be carved out of a preceding fee simple by executory devise. In such case the fee is divested only so far as is necessary to give effect to the executory life estate and, subject thereto, remains in the heirs of the prior devisee in fee. Medcalf v. Whitely's Adm'x, 290 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 94</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 348, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 351</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        Under language in will “I will, bequeath and devise all my personal property not otherwise disposed of and all real estate wheresoever situated to my legal heirs as the law of Kentucky directs. If either of my grandsons should die leaving no issue of the body then the remaining grandson shall have his brother’s share as well as his own. This shall apply to real estate as well as personal property.” Each grandson took a defeasible or a determinable fee in one half of testator’s real estate and in addition each acquired an “executory interest” in the lands of the other which he could convey at will and, when one grandson conveyed his interest, he parted not only with his then existent estate, the defeasible fee in one half, but with his right to take the future estate which would arise in the other one half should the other grandson die without issue.

        A will creating a defeasible fee disposes of the testator’s entire interest in the land at the time of his death, although the title may be defeated afterwards by the happening of the contingency named in the will. A fee simple estate may be limited by a provision that it shall terminate by the happening of a contingency, and it is still a fee, since it will last forever if the contingency does not happen and a son could convey his equitable interest in a devise in trust for him until his sister reached 21 or died.

        Restraints against alienation are not favored by law and heir with an undivided two thirds (2/3) of designated land in trust until his sister reached 21 years of age or died could convey his equitable interest and the sister, who was coowner, could not have forfeiture declared against her brother’s interest.

        Grantor had power to sell and convey her vested reversionary right to property conveyed to be held so long as it was used for a school or to release it at any time to the holder of the defeasible or determinable fee thereby vesting complete title to the land in the grantees or their successors and, being an interest in property which could be sold, it was an interest which descended to the heirs in the absence of testamentary disposition.

        At common law a conveyance of land to the husband and wife constituted an estate by entireties, and death terminated the title in such estate of the first one dying and the survivor held the entire estate; but the common law in this respect was superseded or annulled by this section.

       <p>
        Conveyance to husband and wife for and during their natural lives with remainder in fee to their child or children if any be left at the time of their death came within the exception provided by this section, and secured to the wife a right by survivorship to the entire property during her natural life and she, having survived the husband, had the right to maintain action in her own name for entire injury complained of. Louisville v. Coleburne, 108 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 420</cite>, 56 S.W. 681, 22 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 64</cite>, 1900 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 59</cite> (Ky. 1900).

       <p>
        A provision in deed conveying land to husband and wife “during their natural lives only, and at their death the same is to revert to the legal heirs of the party of the first part” amounts to an express provision for right of survivorship, unless presumption is rebutted by terms of deed and the survivor is not required to surrender one half the property. McCallister v. Folden's Assignee, 110 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 732</cite>, 62 S.W. 538, 23 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 113</cite>, 1901 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Right of survivorship was expressly provided for in deed, as the words “or the survivor” were invariably used whenever the names of the husband and wife appeared. Harris v.

        Where real estate was conveyed or devised to husband and wife with a right of survivorship expressly provided for, the husband, during the life of the wife, could not alienate or forfeit the estate and it could not be subjected to payment of his debts, as the whole of it belonged to the wife as well as to himself, and upon his death prior to her death, the whole estate became hers absolutely.

        Deed to husband and wife “during their joint lives as tenants in common, with remainder in fee simple to the survivor of them” gave husband an undivided one-half (1/2) interest in the right to use, occupancy and rents of the entire property during joint lives and a contingent fee in the entire real estate, and bankrupt husband’s interest passed to trustee in bankruptcy.

        The chief peculiarity of an estate in joint tenancy is the right of survivorship by which, upon the death of one joint tenant, the entire tenancy remains to the surviving cotenants, not to the heirs or other representatives of the deceased, the last survivor taking the whole estate. Louisville v. Coleburne, 108 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 420</cite>, 56 S.W. 681, 22 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 64</cite>, 1900 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 59</cite> (Ky. 1900).

        Where property was conveyed to husband and wife jointly “for and during their joint lives with remainder in fee to the survivor of either, their heirs and assigns forever,” upon the death of the husband, the wife became the owner of the fee by virtue of the deed.

        Deed to husband and wife in fee, providing that land should “revert” to wife at death of husband or to the husband at death of wife, manifested intent that, at the death of either, the survivor was to take title to the whole tract of land.

       <p>
        The purpose of the law is to stabilize land titles and to favor vested estates. Weller v. Dinwiddie, 198 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 360</cite>, 248 S.W. 874, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 445</cite> (Ky. 1923). See Snyder v. Snider, 202 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 321</cite>, 259 S.W. 700, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 711</cite> (Ky. 1924).

        2. Construction.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A conveyance of real estate may be construed as transferring an absolute title rather than a lesser, if the language employed is susceptible of two (2) constructions. Campbell v. Wells, 278 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 209</cite>, 128 S.W.2d 592, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 408</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section makes it the duty of the court to adopt a construction favoring a fee where it is not clear what estate the testator intended to devise. Hopson's Trustee v. Hopson, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 181</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 365, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 156</cite> (Ky. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        In applying this section and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc381s381.070" target="_self">KRS 381.070</a></cite>, it has generally been held that the phrases “heirs of the body,” “heirs lawfully begotten of the body,” and other similar expressions are appropriate words of limitation, and are to be construed as creating an estate tail, which by the statute is converted into a fee-simple estate, unless there be something else in the deed or will from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that the words were used in a different sense from their technical and legal signification; so, in deed to husband and wife providing that property was to revert to the wife and her bodily heirs if husband pre-deceased wife, the words “her bodily heirs” were words of limitation and not of purchase and deed conveyed a fee simple to the husband and wife and nothing to the children. Nunn v. Wright, 303 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 288</cite>, 197 S.W.2d 439, 1946 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 839</cite> (Ky. 1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the fiction created by this section where there is possession by a vendee who may never even see the land, the court calls this a nonpossessory interest. Gatliff Coal Co. v. Lawson, 247 S.W.2d 375, 1952 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 693</cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does nothing more than dispense with the necessity of using “words of inheritance” in a deed or will in order to create a fee, and did not change the rule that where there are words in a conveyance or devise indicating intent, they will nevertheless govern. Collings v. Collings' Ex'rs, 260 S.W.2d 935, 1953 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 986</cite> (Ky. 1953), overruled,
    Melton v. Wyatt, 517 S.W.2d 242, 1974 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 23</cite> (Ky. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where obscure words are contained in a will, the quest is for intention of the testator’s mind, but where they are contained in a deed or contract, a bilateral instrument executed for a consideration, the court must seek the intention of both the grantor and the grantee and, in such a case, the doubts in relation to character of title are resolved in favor of passing entire title. Kentland Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Blankenship, 300 S.W.2d 570, 1957 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 463</cite> (Ky. 1957).

       <p>
        Subsection (1) of this section changes the common-law rule limiting a grant without words of inheritance to a life estate and does not apply where there are any words in the conveyance indicating how the title is to pass. See Hall v. Wright, 121 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 16</cite>, 87 S.W. 1129, 27 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1185</cite>, 1905 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        This section merely dispensed with the necessity of using words of inheritance in a deed or will to create a fee and did not apply to a testamentary bequest of residuary estate to widow with power to appoint at her death to some fund that she might see fit. McKee v. Hedges, 297 S.W.2d 45, 1956 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 13</cite> (Ky. 1956).

       <p>
        Where the word “children” is used, as when estate is given to “A and his children,” the uniform ruling has been that A will not take the fee, but whether he will take a life estate or a joint estate with the children is to be determined from a consideration of the relationship of the parties and the language of the instrument. McFarland v. Hatchett, 118 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 423</cite>, 80 S.W. 1185, 26 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 276</cite>, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 55</cite> (Ky. 1904).

       <p>
        In view of uncertainty in arriving at intention of maker of deed or will in use of words “heirs of his body,” “bodily heirs,” or the like, it is safer to conclude the conveyance was designed to pass the fee and not a life estate or joint interest; this construction should prevail in absence of language indicating a purpose to invest grantee with only a life estate or joint interest. Lawson v. Todd, 129 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 132</cite>, 110 S.W. 412, 33 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 557</cite>, 1908 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 143</cite> (Ky. 1908). See Belcher v. Ramey, 173 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 784</cite>, 191 S.W. 520, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 521</cite> (Ky. 1917); Williams v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where instrument creates a fee-simple legal estate in land, a subsequent clause which restrains the sale of estate during life of vendee or devisee is void. Brock v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The court will not adopt a strained construction to create a trust instead of an absolute gift. If a provision is doubtful, a trust will not be implied, for the law favors the vesting of a fee. Moore v. Garvey's Adm'r, 290 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 61</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 363, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 354</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        Where the deed clause stated that the pump and engine company and its successors agreed and covenanted with the neighbors’ predecessors to supply adequate water and that this agreement was appurtenant to the land, this was sufficient to create a covenant that ran with the land pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc381s381.060ol11" target="_self">KRS 381.060(1)</a></cite>, despite the failure to use words of inheritance.

        Though devise to a survivor and his descendants did not at common law create an estate tail, under our statutes it creates more than a life estate in survivor; considering devise of land to two (2) grandsons, it was held that upon death of one (1) without child, the other, if living, takes the property, and, if he is dead, it passes to his descendants. Simpson v. Adams, 127 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 790</cite>, 106 S.W. 819, 32 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 617</cite>, 1908 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 21</cite> (Ky. 1908).

        In such case, the fact that the will made the widow and daughter joint executrices, with power of sale but with no provision as to disposition of proceeds of sale, did not limit the daughter’s estate.

        Where testator devised his property to his widow for life, with remainder to his daughter with further provision that if daughter “shall predecease me, or die after me, without issue,” the estate should go to other persons, it was held that the contingent remainder to others could take effect only if the daughter died before the termination of the widow’s life estate and, if the daughter survived the widow, her estate became an absolute fee.

        Words “with the understanding that any of my estate remaining at the time of his death, be given according to a verbal agreement between us” cannot reasonably be construed to be words of limitation, but only as precatory words — words referring to a wish or desire which the testatrix intended to express but never did.

        The law of the state where the land is situated governs the construction of a deed, insofar as it determines the title or interest that one takes thereunder. Middleton's Trustee v. Middleton, 172 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 826</cite>, 189 S.W. 1133, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 270</cite> (Ky. 1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the granting clause and the habendum clause of a deed are irreconcilable, and the other parts of the deed do not make it appear which the grantor intended should control, the granting clause will prevail. Ratliffe v. Ratliffe, 182 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 230</cite>, 206 S.W. 478, 1918 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 359</cite> (Ky. 1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any confused or ambiguous language in deed will be construed against grantor and in favor of grantee. Campbell v. Wells, 278 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 209</cite>, 128 S.W.2d 592, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 408</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        A deed regular on its face will not be adjudged a mortgage in the absence of clear and satisfactory proof showing that the instrument was intended to be a mortgage. Evidence supported chancellor’s finding that deed was not a mortgage. Schuster v. Caldwell, 280 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 802</cite>, 134 S.W.2d 624, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        The rule that wills must be so construed, if possible, as to avoid imputing to testator an intention to die intestate as to part of his property has no application in the construction of deeds. Hopson's Trustee v. Hopson, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 181</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 365, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 156</cite> (Ky. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the intention of the parties is apparent from the examination of a deed “from its four corners” without regard to its technical and formal divisions, it will be given effect even though, in so doing, technical rules of construction will be violated. Hays v. Kentucky West Virginia Gas Co., 290 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 174</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 376, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 357</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule that an habendum creating an estate contradictory or repugnant to that given in the granting clause must be rejected is not a rule of property, but is merely a rule of construction, which will be resorted to only where the court cannot determine which of the clauses was intended to be controlling. Hays v. Kentucky West Virginia Gas Co., 290 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 174</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 376, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 357</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ambiguous qualifications imposed upon a grant that would otherwise create a fee simple will not be given effect. Winn v. William, 292 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 44</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 961, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 24</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        Deed to wife of property “to have, to hold and to use as she may wish” gave her fee-simple estate, the words “to use” not restricting preceding words. Scott v. Scott, 105 S.W. 896, 32 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 464</cite> (1907).

        Deed conveying property to trustee for benefit of grantor’s children and giving trustee full power to sell and convey the trust property conveyed a fee-simple estate to trustee.

        Where deed did not mention children of grantee in caption or granting clause, and habendum clause was “to the use of the party of the second part and her children forever,” it is apparent “children” was used in sense of “heirs,” giving grantee a fee-simple title. Miller v. Campbell, 167 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 252</cite>, 180 S.W. 372, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 837</cite> (Ky. 1915).

    . . . . .

Campbell v. Wells, 278 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 209</cite>, 128 S.W.2d 592, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 408</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        Where consideration for deed was grantee’s agreement to support grantor for life, but there was no reservation of a right of re-entry for breach, nor any provision for reversion, the support agreement was not a condition subsequent, and grantor’s heirs could not maintain an action for rescission. Manning v. Street, 279 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 253</cite>, 130 S.W.2d 735, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 266</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        Under deed conveying land to trustees and their successors in perpetual succession in trust for the use of churches “that hold meeting there and for school purposes forever,” the deed reciting a valuable consideration and there being no words implying a condition or limitation, and there being no reversionary clause, the trustees took a fee-simple title. The words “for school purposes” were only descriptive of the nature of the only use the trustees might make of the property, and did not create a limitation or condition on the fee. Therefore, subsequent transfer of title to all school property to state, under act of legislature, did not cause a reverter. Board of Education v. Board of Education, 292 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 261</cite>, 166 S.W.2d 295, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 69</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        19. Easement.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A conveyance to a railroad specifically for a right of way conveys only an easement, and the fact that the deed contains a warranty or designates the conveyed interest as a fee is not controlling. Sherman v. Petroleum Exploration, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 105</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 768, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 86</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        A deed must be interpreted as a whole and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made and, in construing an indefinite and ambiguous conveyance of property specifically for a railroad right of way, the court will consider the fact that much railroad right of way is expressly or by operation of law limited to an easement, which is usually sufficient for the use intended. Sherman v. Petroleum Exploration, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 105</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 768, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 86</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grantor conveyed a narrow strip of land, described by reference to a surveyed line on which railroad tracks were to be laid, “unto the party of the second part and its successors and assigns
    . . . . .
    for railroad right of way
    . . . . .
    to have and to hold
    . . . . .
    unto the party of the second part and its successors and assigns forever, with covenant of general warranty of title.” The deed conveyed an easement for railroad purposes, and not a fee, and the easement reverted to the grantor when the strip was abandoned. Sherman v. Petroleum Exploration, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 105</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 768, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 86</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a deed conveying a railroad right of way, the words “railroad right of way” cannot be treated as surplusage, since it is presumed that no word or clause in a deed is used without meaning or intent; the words quoted are a declaration of purpose. Sherman v. Petroleum Exploration, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 105</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 768, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 86</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because railroad owned nothing more than a right-of-way easement, upon abandonment of the easement, it could not be obligated to maintain fencing along the easement and its attempt to convey by quit-claim deed a certain stretch of the right of way to outside parties was ineffective; present owners of the servient estates hold the underlying strips of land discharged with the easement; owners generally holding to the center of the strip of land comprising the easement to be determined on remand.

        Party maintaining action for forcible entry must have been in actual possession when entry was made; neither right of possession nor constructive possession will avail. Cuyler v. Estis, 64 S.W. 673, 23 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1063</cite> (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Delivery of deed showing intent to vest fee-simple title vested possession of land in grantee, and grantee could not be ousted from this constructive possession except by taking of actual possession by someone. Travis v. Bruce, 172 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 390</cite>, 189 S.W. 939, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 264</cite> (Ky. 1916).

       <p>
        Constructive possession is in title holder to land, and, when title of an owner is conveyed and he remains in possession thereafter, he presumably holds under and not against his grantee, unless and until he brings home to grantee the fact he is holding and claiming adversely. Wiser v. Shacklett, 208 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 317</cite>, 270 S.W. 754, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 276</cite> (Ky. 1925).

       </p>
       <p>
        A vendee in possession under a general warranty deed must sue at law for any breach of warranty and may not have equitable relief of cancellation in absence of extraordinary circumstances, but a vendee not in possession, and who cannot lawfully be put in possession because vendor had no title, may sue in equity for rescission. Creech v. Jenkins, 276 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 163</cite>, 123 S.W.2d 267, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 540</cite> (Ky. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a single deed was so drafted as to constitute a conveyance from the grantors to the grantee, and from the grantee back to the grantors as joint tenants, the intention to make a valid delivery to the grantee was clear, and the deed was valid to create the joint tenancy. Preston v. Harlow, 276 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 799</cite>, 125 S.W.2d 726, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 594</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        There can be no such thing as an unvested title to real estate. Hardin v. Sherley, 292 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 275</cite>, 166 S.W.2d 425, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 77</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        Where conveyance is to a person and his “children,” it is uniformly held that such person does not receive the fee, unless from the entire instrument it appears that the grantor used the word “children” in the technical sense of the word “heirs.” McFarland v.

       <p>
        The rule that the words “heirs of the body” or “bodily heirs” or similar words create an estate tail, convertible by this section into a fee simple, does not prevail where it appears from other language of the instrument that the words were used as words of purchase and not of limitation.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a will the term “issue” may be employed either as a word of purchase or of limitation, according to which sense will best effectuate the testator’s intention; it is usually construed as a word of limitation, unless there be controlling words clearly showing that the contrary meaning was intended by its use. Bonnycastle v. Lilly, 153 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 834</cite>, 156 S.W. 874, 1913 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 925</cite> (Ky. 1913) (Ky. 1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        “Posterity” embraces descendants to the remotest generation; “issue” is as comprehensive as “posterity” and embraces as does the latter not only children but descendants to the remotest generations. Bonnycastle v. Lilly, 153 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 834</cite>, 156 S.W. 874, 1913 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 925</cite> (Ky. 1913) (Ky. 1913).

       <p>
        The controlling rule of construction recognized by the courts of Kentucky is that the intent is to be ultimately determined upon a consideration of the whole deed and with the endeavor to give every part of it meaning and effect; the rules that a conveyance in fee is not overthrown by a subsequent proviso, and that a deed is to be construed strongly against the grantor, are merely aids to the application of the controlling rule. Woodward v. Thissell, 218 F. 810, 1914 U.S. App. LEXIS 1611 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1914</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        An examination of the cases will show that in some of them the Court of Appeals construed the term “bodily heirs” or others of similar import to be words of limitation and not words of purchase, since there was nothing in the instrument to indicate a significance to be given them other than their primary effect as fixed by the law, thus passing a fee-simple estate to the grantee or devisee, while in other cases it was held that, because of expressions found in some parts of the instrument and the particular manner and connection with which the terms were used, the maker intended to use them in the sense of “children,” and the court thereby construed them as words of purchase, giving to the grantee or devisee either a life estate or a joint interest with those included as “children,” dependent upon what the court found was the intention of the grantor or testator. Wilson v. Woodward, 190 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 326</cite>, 227 S.W. 446, 1921 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 432</cite> (Ky. 1921).

        Devise to son and his bodily heirs, and should he die without bodily heirs then to be divided among his brothers or sisters, gave son only a defeasible fee. Littell v.

        Extrinsic evidence is never admissible to enlarge or diminish estate devised, or to vary legal effect of language of will. Simons v. Bowers, 258 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 755</cite>, 81 S.W.2d 604, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 246</cite> (Ky. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a conveyance is to a person “and his children,” the person takes only a life estate with remainder to the children, unless it appears that the grantor used “children” in the sense of “heirs.” Where a conveyance is to a person “and the heirs of the body” or “and his bodily heirs,” the person takes a fee simple, unless it appears that the words “heirs” was used in the sense of “children,” in which case the person will take only a life estate. Combs v. Combs, 294 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 89</cite>, 171 S.W.2d 13, 1943 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 391</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The use of the words “these requests are not to be interpreted as entailing the estate” was to avoid any implication of inconvenience or trouble or involvement of the estate and not the legal aspects of “estates tail.” Bosworth v. Kilbourn, 304 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 628</cite>, 201 S.W.2d 904, 1947 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 694</cite> (Ky. 1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section will control except where it is apparent from the entire deed or will that the intention of the testator was to create a life estate in the first taker with remainder to his or her children, and then only when such intention is so clear as to more than overbalance the ordinary meaning of the words “heirs of the body” or “bodily heirs.” Sallee v. Warner, 306 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 846</cite>, 209 S.W.2d 491, 1948 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 663</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the existence of estates tail had been prohibited, in the construction of deeds it could not be considered that a person intended to create such an estate unless the language forbade any other construction.

        “Children” was not, like “heirs,” or, as construed under our law, “heirs of the body,” a word of limitation, importing by its own force a fee-simple estate.

        In view of uncertainty in arriving at intention of maker of deed or will in use of words “heirs of his body,” “bodily heirs,” or the like, it is safer to conclude the conveyance was designed to pass the fee and not a life estate or joint interest; this construction should prevail in absence of language indicating a purpose to invest grantee with only a life estate or joint interest.

        Devise to testator’s son, with provision that if he should die without issue the property should go to testator’s unmarried daughters, “but if he should die with heirs” it was to go to them, created an estate tail which was converted by law into an estate in fee.

        Where property was devised to A for life, then to B “and his children forever” without the right to dispose of it during his life or the life of his children and in the event B “should die childless” then to another, the interest devised to B was an unconditional fee-simple title by operation of this section and not a defeasible fee or a life estate.

        Deed which conveyed land to husband and wife and the heirs of the wife “belonging to” the husband would have created an estate tail at common law, but under this section the estate created was a fee simple in the husband and wife, and their children had no interest under this deed.

        Where granting and habendum clauses were in the usual language “heirs and assigns” which are words of limitation, the conveyance was converted into a fee-simple estate under this section, although, in the paragraph reciting the parties, the words “her heirs after her death” were used which might have been interpreted to convey a remainder estate to her children or descendants.

        It is the settled rule in this state that the words “bodily heirs” and “heirs of the body” and other similar expressions are appropriate words of limitation and when used in a deed will be given their ordinary legal meaning, unless there be something in the instrument itself which shows that they were used in a contrary sense as “children” or words of purchase.

        The terms “bodily heirs,” “heirs of the body,” “heirs lawfully begotten of the body,” and other similar ones, as applying to a grantee in a deed or a devise in a will, at common law created an entailed estate giving to the grantee or devisee a life estate and a similar estate to his lineal descendants, and so on in a successive line as long as there were such lineal descendants, but in 1796 the legislature of Kentucky enacted what became this section which converted such estates into estates in fee simple, unless from the language found in the whole instrument, deed or will, it appeared with reasonable clearness that it was the intention of the creator of the estate that a different construction prevail.

        Conveyance to woman and “her bodily heirs” created an estate tail which was by law converted into a fee simple, since nothing in deed indicated the words “bodily heirs” were used in the sense of “children” as words of purchase.

        Conveyance to grantee and “bodily heirs or issue of her body” were intended as words of limitation and created an estate tail at common law, converted by this section into a fee but subject to imposed valid qualifying limitations the same as a common law created fee.

        Deed from father to daughter, conveying land to “the grantee and her bodily heirs, and assigns, forever,” was governed by this section, and so daughter took a fee-simple estate, as against contention that she had only a life estate with remainder to children, or a joint estate with children.

        Since deeds will be interpreted so as to make all of their provisions operative if the terms are susceptible of such an interpretation and one (1) clause in a deed will not be given more weight than another, where granting clause was to grantee, his bodily heirs and assigns but habendum clause read to have and to hold the same to grantee, his bodily heirs and assigns forever and the description read to grantee to sue as long as he live and at his natural death then go to his bodily heirs, grantee took a life estate with remainder to his children; and thus <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc381s381.090" target="_self">KRS 381.090</a></cite> should apply rather than this section.

        Codicil that provided “In stating Robert Stanley Harmon (the grandchild referred to in the will) or Robert Owens Moss’ (son of testator) children are to heir his property heired from me does not mean said properties are entitled to said heirs” did not have the effect of revoking portions of will creating life estates in children and converting them into fee-simple estates.

        This section means that unless a different purpose is expressed, every limitation in a deed or will contingent upon a person dying without issue shall take effect when this person shall die, unless the issue (the object on which the contingency is made to depend) is then living, or if a child of his body be born within ten (10) months thereafter. Harvey v. Bell, 118 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 512</cite>, 81 S.W. 671, 26 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 381</cite>, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 69</cite> (Ky. 1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section simply abolishes the common-law rule by which the words referred to were construed to refer to an indefinite failure of issue, and makes the estate to depend only on the failure of issue at the death of the person named; it was so construed by the Court of Appeals at the time of the enactment. Harvey v. Bell, 118 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 512</cite>, 81 S.W. 671, 26 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 381</cite>, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 69</cite> (Ky. 1904).

        Courts may invoke the transposition of employed words and phrases so as to bring them in accord with the evident intention of those employing them and to supply glaringly omitted words so as to make the meaning clear. Kentucky Real Estate Board v. Smith, 272 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 313</cite>, 114 S.W.2d 107, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 117</cite> (Ky. 1938).

       <p>
        The common rule that, where testator first devises a fee-simple title, he cannot later in the same will limit the fee by other dispositions upon the theory that, having disposed of the entire estate by an absolute devise, nothing remained in the testator upon which a limitation could be placed, has been departed from because it conflicts with the cardinal rule of construction of wills, that the court will look to the four (4) corners of the will to determine the intent of the testator and will give due weight to each provision. Johnson v. Foley, 302 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 848</cite>, 196 S.W.2d 733, 1946 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 772</cite> (Ky. 1946).

        Where the instrument disposes of personal property, the words “dying without issue,” and others of similar import, refer to a death of the first taker before that of the one from whom he obtains the property, unless a different intention appears from the entire language of the instrument. Whitlow's Adm'r v. Saunders' Adm'r, 237 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 842</cite>, 36 S.W.2d 659, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 879</cite> (Ky. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the intention of the testator cannot be ascertained from the will, this section is not applicable and it is presumed that the phrase “dying without issue” where personal property is involved refers to such death before the death of the testator; but when real estate is involved, it is presumed that the phrase means death at any time without issue and where the real and personal property are not separated, but are devised as a whole, both classes will be governed by the real estate rule. Prewitt v. Prewitt's Ex'rs, 303 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 772</cite>, 199 S.W.2d 435, 1947 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 550</cite> (Ky. 1947).

        The rule of construction is technical, and is to be applied only when there is no period to which the words “dying without children” can be reasonably referred, and in the absence of something in the will evidencing a contrary intent; rules of construction are but means of ascertaining the testator’s intention, and when this is apparent from the whole will, it must be enforced. Duncan v. Duncan, 175 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 253</cite>, 194 S.W. 328, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 318</cite> (Ky. 1917).

        The words “should they die before her death” have the same legal effect as “should she die without children.” Wallen v. Nicely, 222 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 825</cite>, 2 S.W.2d 648, 1928 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 252</cite> (Ky. 1928).

       <p>
        Where will devised property to testator’s son and daughters as tenants in common, with provision that upon death of any of devisees “without issue” his interest should pass to survivors, the phrase “without issue” meant without surviving issue. Sipes v. Boehmer, 291 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 824</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 807, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 326</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        Instrument which purported to give estate, but with limitation over should devisees or grantee die without issue, or without heirs, gave the devisee or grantee a defeasible fee, subject to be defeated upon contingency of his death at any time without survival of any of the persons named upon whose survival the fee became absolute.

        Since the first enactment of this section, it uniformly has been held by the Court of Appeals that the limitation over took effect at the death of the immediately preceding taker (vendee or devisee) at any time, without being survived by any of the persons upon whose survival the fee became absolute. Kimbrell v. Parmer, 202 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 686</cite>, 261 S.W. 11, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 777</cite> (Ky. 1924).

       <p>
        The correct rule is that where an estate is given or conveyed directly to the devisee, without any intervening particular estate, and without anything in the instrument indicating a contrary purpose, limiting words such as “dies without heirs” have reference to the death of the taker at any time and devise to daughter but if she dies without heirs to go to brother gave a defeasible fee in land subject to be defeated by her death at any time without heirs or without issue where there was nothing in the will to indicate to the contrary. Atkinson v. Kern, 210 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 824</cite>, 276 S.W. 977, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 789</cite> (Ky. 1925).

       <p>
        Where there is no intervening estate and no other period to which the words “die without issue” can be reasonably said to have reference, they are held, in the absence of something in the will showing a contrary purpose, to create a defeasible fee, which may be defeated by the death of the devisee at any time without issue surviving him. Wallen v. Nicely, 222 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 825</cite>, 2 S.W.2d 648, 1928 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 252</cite> (Ky. 1928). See Laughlin v.

        Where testatrix did not separate the personal and real property but devised it as a whole, and indicated no intention or purpose of making an absolute devise as to one class of property and limiting the interest devised as to another class, both personal and real property were devised together and must all be governed by the general rule that “dying without issue” had reference to death of devisee at any time. Ryan v. Ball, 267 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 83</cite>, 101 S.W.2d 187, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 273</cite> (Ky. 1937).

        Testator devised land to A and B, providing that if A or B should die before reaching the age of 21 or without “issue of the body” his interest should pass to the other, and that if both A and B should die before reaching the age of 24 or without issue of the body their interest should revert to the testator’s estate. Thus, the will contemplated a definite failure of issue so that the property would revert only if A or B died without issue before reaching the age of 21 or both died without issue before reaching the age of 24. Lindsay v. Williams, 279 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 749</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 65, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 348</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        The common-law rule that where one conveys a life estate to another with remainder to the heirs of the grantor they take as reversioners, and the grantor being himself the reversioner, after making such limitation may grant the reversion, is not affected by this section, as the heirs therein referred to are the heirs of the grantee and not those of the grantor.

        If the intention of the parties is apparent from the examination of the deed “from its four corners” without regard to its technical and formal divisions, it will be given effect even though, in so doing, technical rules of construction will be violated.

        Where there is nothing in a deed or will to show a contrary purpose, an estate deeded or devised to a man and his children is a life estate to the first taker, with remainder to the children; however, even though devise read to my son and his children, it was clear from other provisions of the will that testator knew the language to employ to pass a life estate if he so desired and since he had imposed restraint on alienation of the land in expectation that he had conveyed a fee to his children and since son was required to pay certain sums to his sisters, the devise to the son was a fee-simple estate.

Louisville Cooperage Co. v. Rudd, 276 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 721</cite>, 124 S.W.2d 1063, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 562</cite> (Ky. 1938).

        A deed conveying land to grantor’s niece for life and at her death to her bodily heirs conveyed a life estate to niece and the remainder in fee simple to her children. Lawson v. Asberry, 283 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 390</cite>, 141 S.W.2d 564, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 342</cite> (Ky. 1940).

        Where grantor conveyed life estate to niece with remainder to her bodily heirs in consideration of niece’s promise to support him for life, and provided for reversion if niece failed to perform, and niece later reconveyed to grantor in consideration of cash and release from agreement, the grantor’s successor in title could assert the release agreement was effectual to deprive niece’s children of title to reconveyed property. Lawson v. Asberry, 283 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 390</cite>, 141 S.W.2d 564, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 342</cite> (Ky. 1940).

        Where deed conveyed property to grantee for life, and upon her death to grantee’s son for his life, and upon his death “to go to his son, A. V. Combs, to be held for the children of said A. V. Combs,” the deed vested a present fee-simple title in the children of A. V. Combs, subject to the life estates of their grandfather and great-grandmother, notwithstanding that the children were named only in the habendum clause and not in the granting clause; the only interest acquired by A. V. Combs was that of trustee of a naked trust for his children. Combs v. Combs, 292 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 445</cite>, 166 S.W.2d 969, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 109</cite> (Ky. 1942).

       <p>
        Where owner of property prepared in his own handwriting a deed purporting to convey property to his wife and his heirs, the latter being named as grantees by the phrase, “Matilda Combs and J. W. Combs’ heirs, of the second part,” and the granting, habendum and warranty clauses conveyed the land to “the party of the second part and to his heirs and assigns forever,” the wife took only a life estate, with a remainder to the children of the grantor. Combs v. Combs, 294 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 89</cite>, 171 S.W.2d 13, 1943 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 391</cite> (Ky. 1943).

       <p>
        Where a deed stated that at the death of the party to whom the property was conveyed, the property would “descend” to certain heirs, the estate conveyed to that party was to continue for her life. East Kentucky Energy Corp. v. Niece, 774 S.W.2d 458, 1989 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 99</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).

        Bankruptcy trustee was permitted to sell a debtor’s interest in property where the interpretation of an entire document showed that a grantor intended to convey a life estate and remainder in certain property, despite fee simple language in the document.

        Although five (5) of six (6) joint owners of land containing minerals preferred to divide the land, the other joint owner had the right, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.33.html#tXXXIIIc389s389.020" target="_blank">KRS 389.020</a></cite> to have the entire tract sold on ground of indivisibility.

        The generally established rule in this state is that a partition may generally best be had of a tract of mineral land by a sale on the ground of indivisibility. Laws v. Sturgill, 287 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 37</cite>, 151 S.W.2d 423, 1941 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 482</cite> (Ky. 1941).

        Where defendant owned surface rights in one (1) parcel of land and another person owned surface rights in adjoining parcel, and these two (2) persons together with plaintiff each owned an undivided one third (1/3) of mineral rights under both parcels, defendant’s conveyance to another of the parcel owned by him, which conveyance purported to include an absolute title to the mineral rights, and which conveyance was acquiesced in and consented to by the other joint owners of the mineral rights, constituted a partition of the mineral rights, and severed any interest defendant had in the mineral rights under the surface of the other parcel. Fugate v. Smith, 290 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 115</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 328, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 344</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        Land containing minerals may be partitioned unless the mineral is so situated that a fair division of it cannot be made by dividing the surface of the land, but mere speculation as to presence of minerals in commercially valuable amount is not sufficient to defeat partition. Tuggle v. Davis, 292 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 27</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 844, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 19</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where surface of land was capable of being divided fairly, the presence of coal seams and the probable presence of natural gas below the surface would not prevent partition in the absence of convincing proof that the coal and gas were capable of successful commercial development. Tuggle v. Davis, 292 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 27</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 844, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 19</cite> (Ky. 1942).

       <p>
        Where there had never been any attempt to lease or develop coal and gas, and evidence indicated that coal and gas were not present in sufficient quantities to justify commercial development, it was proper to decree physical partition.

        A provision, in deed conveying land to husband and wife, “during their natural lives only, and at their death the same revert to the legal heirs of the party of the first part,” amounts to an express provision for right of survivorship, unless presumption is rebutted by terms of deed.

        It is the rule in this state that the law favors a division of land in kind rather than a sale and a division of the proceeds and this rule particularly obtains where the property sought to be divided or sold is farmland or other parcels of real estate reasonably susceptible of division. However, with respect to town lots, it has been consistently held that the court will presume, without necessity of proof, that such lot is not susceptible of advantageous division. Fannin v. Fannin, 256 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 273</cite>, 75 S.W.2d 1042, 1934 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 375</cite> (Ky. 1934).

        Where the owner of an undivided remainder interest and the life tenant filed a petition in equity against the other owners of remainder interests for partition of the remainder, it was an equitable action for partition under subsection (14) of this section as opposed to one to divide lands jointly owned under subsection (1).

        The county court has jurisdiction to divide land which is held jointly by two (2) or more persons, and, upon an application for a division by one of several joint owners, may hear and determine any equitable defense that may be pleaded against a division. Hopkins v. Crouch, 86 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 281</cite>, 5 S.W. 557, 9 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 554</cite>, 1887 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 125</cite> (Ky. 1887).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the right to partition the land is contested or the title to the land is involved, then on the motion of either party the action is to be removed to the Circuit Court for the trial of the question of title. Hunt v. Phillips, 105 S.W. 445, 32 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 257</cite> (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Circuit Court and the county court have jurisdiction over partition proceedings, and the pendency of such a suit in one court constitutes a bar to a later filed suit in a different or the same court. Webb v. Martin, 194 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 360</cite>, 238 S.W. 1043, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 153</cite> (Ky. 1922).

       <p>
        Subject to the right of a party to have the action removed from the county court to the Circuit Court after the filing of an answer controverting the allegations of the petition, or contesting the rights therein claimed, county courts and circuit courts have concurrent jurisdiction of partition proceedings. Duke v. Allen, 198 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 368</cite>, 248 S.W. 894, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 458</cite> (Ky. 1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        A county court, in a proceeding to partition land, is a court of general jurisdiction, and its judgment is immune from collateral attack as the judgment of any other court of general jurisdiction, and the same presumptions are indulged in its favor. Morgan v. Big Woods Lumber Co., 198 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 88</cite>, 249 S.W. 329, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 486</cite> (Ky. 1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        County courts and Circuit Courts have concurrent jurisdiction of partition proceedings and, from a final judgment rendered by either court an appeal, may be taken to the Court of Appeals, but a claim to dower is an assertion of a right to an interest in real estate and the Circuit Court has exclusive jurisdiction under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc23s23.010" target="_blank">KRS 23.010</a></cite> of actions in which the title to real estate is in question.

       </p>
       <p>
        Sale of property and distribution of proceeds was properly ordered by common-law court where it determined land could not be partitioned though court failed to enter an order transferring the case to the equity docket. Cunningham v. Grey, 271 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 84</cite>, 111 S.W.2d 579, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 200</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Circuit Court properly adjudicated the validity of two (2) deeds under which plaintiff was claiming in a partition proceeding and the proceeding did not constitute a collateral attack on the deeds.

        The court has no authority to partition land, or direct the commissioners how to make the division, but the partition should be set aside and new commissioners appointed to make proper partition where a party is entitled to such relief. Rudy v. Ramey, 160 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 842</cite>, 170 S.W. 179, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 541</cite> (Ky. 1914).

However, in partition in equity, parties, by pleadings, may make issues they deem best, and court must try issues as in other equitable actions, and may adjudge parties’ rights as to taxes, rents, improvements, owelty and reasonable easements authorized by the pleadings.

        In statutory petition the court could not partition land or direct commissioners how to make division but it had authority only to direct commissioners to make partition having due regard to rights of all interested parties and to divide it as nearly equal as possible, considering quantity, quality and value.

        This section does not limit the persons between whom a court may make a partition of lands to holders of legal titles. The term used therein to describe the person who may compel a partition is one holding land jointly with others. It includes a coparcener, tenant in common, joint tenant, and the holders of both legal and equitable titles. Holder of an equitable title to an interest in land, if he has a present right of possession in contradistinction to an interest to be enjoyed in the future such as a remainder or a reversion, may assert his right and have a partition.

        In action brought by part of appellees, under this section, for division of land among heirs of the deceased, and all persons claiming under the deceased appear to have been made parties, lower court properly refused to permit filing of petition by other parties setting up claim of title to part of the tract, adverse to title of deceased.

       <p>
        In an action for partition of land under this section, it is not necessary to make one who has mortgage lien on the one-fifth (1/5) interest of one of the owners a party to such action. When a person takes a lien upon an undivided interest in land, he must receive it with the understanding that his lien will follow upon the particular interest wherever placed in the division.

        Where wife, a contingent remainderman, died before termination of life estate, she was at no time seized of the land, and her husband was therefore not entitled to curtesy.

        A valid partition may not be had unless all the tenants in common have been subjected to the jurisdiction of the court rendering the decree.

       </p>
       <p>
        While infants are necessary parties to an action for partition of land held by them as joint tenants, and a judgment of partition in a suit to which they were not parties was erroneous, their statutory guardian, after they have been brought before the court, may in open court adopt the report if the partition was equal and just. Blue v. Waters, 114 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 659</cite>, 71 S.W. 889, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1481</cite>, 1903 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 33</cite> (Ky. 1903).

        Judgment ordering sale and division of proceeds instead of partition in kind was in error where spouses, objecting to partition on ground oil and gas existed under the land and there was a possibility of development of coal, conceded divisibility of the land and that existence of oil and gas was speculative and possibility of developing coal remote.

        Where there is a compulsory partition of lands between joint tenants, tenants in common or coparceners, neither the commissioner who conveys the separate allotments nor the court has any authority to insert in the deed a warranty of the title to the land allotted, and if such warranty is inserted in such a deed, in the absence of any fact creating an estoppel to deny the obligations upon the warranty, the owners will not be bound by the warranty, except to the extent of the partitioners and their heirs, and such warranty cannot be invoked by an alienee of one of the joint owners after partition is made, as it will not run with the land.

        Because a Circuit Court had subject matter jurisdiction over a partition action pursuant to a constitutional grant of general jurisdiction, any error associated with the application of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc381s381.136" target="_self">KRS 381.136</a></cite> rendered the judgment voidable, not void.

        Generally, state courts of general jurisdiction have
    in rem
    subject matter jurisdiction over real property in the state. While a partition action is in the nature of an in rem proceeding, it also has characteristics of a
    quasi in rem
    proceeding because it deals with the title to realty and operates as to the parties in the proceeding. Accordingly, a partition action requires both
    in rem
    subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction. Hisle v. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Gov't, 258 S.W.3d 422, 2008 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 27</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).

       <p>
        While by the common law a tenant for life who executed a deed conveying the property in fee accelerated the remainder and gave the remainderman an immediate right of entry, this was remedied in this state by law prior to 1852. Superior Oil Corp. v. Alcorn, 242 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 814</cite>, 47 S.W.2d 973, 1930 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 855</cite> (Ky. 1930).

        The vendee of a life tenant takes only a life estate, notwithstanding the deed of the life tenant purports to convey a fee-simple title. Adkins v. Hackworth, 279 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 352</cite>, 130 S.W.2d 774, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 277</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        Grantees obtained from the life tenant only the estate he actually had and not the fee simple he pretended to convey and possession by grantees and life tenant grantor were not adverse to remainder interest for they were constructively notified by recordation of deed of remainder interest and they did nothing to signify to remaindermen that they were claiming adversely.

       <p>
        Lease of minerals underlying land surface, by persons owning undivided fourth of land in fee and life estate in other three fourths (3/4), was valid, but lessors were entitled only to one fourth (1/4) of royalties and income from remaining three fourths (3/4) of royalties, the corpus to be preserved for remaindermen.

       <p>
        Where deed purported to convey entire fee simple but, at time of conveyance, grantor actually owned only an undivided interest in the land, “reservation” of mineral rights in favor of grantor was effective only as to undivided portion of mineral rights equal to grantor’s undivided interest in land.

        Evidence was insufficient to establish a prior claim to mineral rights where it was claimed title bond or option to plaintiff’s predecessor was lost by fire and the usual length of time for such options was three (3) to six (6) months and, if an option or title bond had existed, it would have expired prior to the deeds to defendants.

        Where one entrusts funds to another to be invested for his benefit, and the latter, without the consent of the former and in fraud of the former’s rights, purchases property and has the title thereto put in the name of a third person, a constructive trust will result in favor of the person who has been defrauded.

        The mere fact that the purchase price was paid by the wife is not sufficient evidence to overturn the terms of a deed, as this would be entirely consistent with the taking of title jointly with a survivorship clause.

        Although it might be true that husband paid for the one-half interest in property which was conveyed to wife, yet it was her property free of any trust, and, if she made an agreement that she would make a certain devise of her one-half interest, the agreement to that extent was within the statute of frauds and unenforceable.

        Constructive trusts never arise except where the holder of the legal title obtained it through fraud, misrepresentation, concealments, undue influence, duress or some other wrongful act whereby another is deprived of the title to his property and infant vendees could not and did not obtain the legal title which their father vested in them through any such methods as is necessary to create a constructive trust.

       <p>
        Whenever the legal title to property has been obtained through any circumstance which renders it unconscientious for the holder of legal title to retain and enjoy the beneficial interest, equity impresses a constructive trust on the property thus acquired in favor of the one who is truly and equitably entitled to the same, although he may never, perhaps, have had any legal estate therein; this principle is not affected by law. Graham v. King, 96 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 339</cite>, 24 S.W. 430, 16 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 440</cite>, 1893 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 147</cite> (Ky. 1893).

        A constructive trust is a way of compelling the parties to do what they agreed to do, and to undo that which in fraud has been done in violation of an agreement. Wright v.

        Where husband turned earnings over to wife, under agreement that she was to keep and invest them for him, she to be entitled to them only if she survived him, wife was a constructive trustee for the benefit of husband.

        A constructive trust is one not created by any words either expressly or impliedly evidencing a direct intention to create a trust, but by the construction of equity in order to satisfy the demands of justice. They are entirely invitum and forced upon the conscience of the trustee for the purpose of working out right and justice or frustrating fraud. Long v.

        Constructive trusts are bottomed on principles akin to the doctrine of equitable estoppel with fraud, active or constructive, as their essential element and, since they arise by operation of law from certain essential facts upon which they rest, they do not come within the statute of frauds requiring duly executed writing for their support and may therefore be established by parol evidence.

        To establish a resulting (constructive) trust under the two (2) exceptions contained in this section, the proof that title was taken in name of nominal purchaser without the consent of real purchaser, or that grantee, in violation of trust, bought land with money or property of another, must be clear and convincing.

        The evidence to establish a parol trust in realty must be clear, definite and convincing, and it is closely scrutinized and carefully weighed by courts because its effect is to upset paper title. Evans v. Payne, 258 S.W.2d 919, 1953 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 896</cite> (Ky. 1953).

        Where title to land purchased with funds of wife is taken by husband in himself, the equitable interest of the wife is not open to attack by creditor of husband, where creditor has not been misled or defrauded by any voluntary act of wife and fails to assert his claim before the completion of wife’s legal title.

        At common law, where property was purchased and the conveyance was taken in the name of one (1) person, while the price was paid by another, a trust at once resulted in favor of the party paying the price, and the holder of the legal title became a trustee for him; such a resulting trust has now been abolished by law, and the rule is, where the contract is not illegal, an action will lie upon the implied promise raised by law to refund the money if the party receiving the title refuses to execute the trust or return the money.

        The nonuse of a clubhouse for approximately five years must be deemed a period of substantial duration, and the informal, indefinite intent of the club to use the property for its legitimate purposes was not sufficient to prevent the operation of the terms of deed which provided for reverter when land ceased to be used for legitimate purposes of the club.

        Where 1869 deed created a possibility of reverter which carried with it an automatic termination on cessation of use as a railroad depot and railroad ceased using the lot as a depot no later than 1948, reversion of property to heirs of original grantor was not prevented by this section since, reversion having already occurred, the possibility of reverter no longer existed by the time the declarations of intent to preserve were required to be filed.

        It was clear error for the trial court to set aside, in a wholesale manner, the original restrictions attached to a deed giving land to the city for a park because, although the heirs right of re-entry had been terminated, the original owner did have a right to specify the particular use to which the land could be devoted, although deed conditions could nevertheless be changed to a certain degree to make them consistent with the times.

        This section has not changed the general equity rule that a suit to quiet title cannot be maintained except by one having both legal title and possession. Morse v. South, 80 F. 206, 1897 U.S. App. LEXIS 2594 (C.C.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1897</cite>).

       <p>
        The word “owner” in this section, authorizing the owner of land, though not in actual possession, to sue for trespass thereon, means one who owns the land by a title of record deducible from the Commonwealth, or who has acquired ownership by adverse possession of the land. Scroggins v. Nave, 133 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 793</cite>, 119 S.W. 158, 1909 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 231</cite> (Ky. 1909).

        The word “owner” in this section means one who owns the land by a title deducible from the Commonwealth or has acquired title by adverse possession. French v. Childers, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 339</cite>, 133 S.W.2d 63, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 117</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        Even if the defendant’s claim is faulty, the plaintiff’s right to recover is dependent not upon the good faith of his claim but the validity of his title. Phillips v. Alma Coal Co., 7 F.2d 42, 1925 U.S. App. LEXIS 3479 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1925</cite>), cert. denied, 271 U.S. 669, 46 S. Ct. 483, 70 L. Ed. 1142, 1926 U.S. LEXIS 747 (U.S. 1926).

        Deed which did not show where grantor obtained title is insufficient to establish plaintiff’s title in action for trespass. French v. Childers, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 339</cite>, 133 S.W.2d 63, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 117</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        In action for trespass, plaintiff cannot prove his own title by proving that his predecessor in title successfully defended actions brought by third parties to quiet title and to recover value of timber removed, where those actions did not require the defendant therein to prove the validity of his own title. French v. Childers, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 339</cite>, 133 S.W.2d 63, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 117</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for trespass, where the title to the land is put in issue, the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title and not on the weakness of defendant’s title. French v. Childers, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 339</cite>, 133 S.W.2d 63, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 117</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        In order to obtain complete relief on the trial of an issue of title, the one trespassed upon must allege and prove, if denied, title back to the Commonwealth, or title by adverse possession, unless title of each litigant is traceable to a common source, in which case no title beyond that source need be proven. Oglesby v. Nation, 282 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 458</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 967, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 188</cite> (Ky. 1940).

        Under this section, an owner of land may maintain an action for the cutting and removing of timber thereon, and destroying the monuments of title, without being in the actual possession of the land at the time of the commission of the injury. Goff v. Lowe, 80 S.W. 219, 25 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 2176</cite> (1904).

        Action for trespass was properly joined with action for recovery of land, and causes should have been transferred to common-law docket and heard by a jury. Turk v.

        The action was not one to quiet title, so as to render the complaint bad for lack of an allegation of possession, but was properly brought under this section, providing that the owner of land may maintain the appropriate action to restrain any trespass thereon or injury thereto, though he may not have the actual possession of the land.

        Injured child’s mother brought action for damages against owner of horse, not known to be violent. Horse injured five (5) year old child who climbed through a barbed wire fence surrounding the farm. Horse was kept on a farm which was in close proximity to two (2) subdivisions. Horse was not an attractive nuisance and thus landowner was not liable. The landowner had attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to prevent trespassing by the children and the cost of rendering the farm inaccessible to children would have been prohibitive.

        Property owner and a contractor were entitled to judgment as a matter of law in a personal injury action because the attractive nuisance doctrine was not applicable when a sixteen-and-a-half year old youth was injured when the youth overturned a piece of heavy equipment that was parked at a residential construction site. The presence of the equipment on the construction site posed an unreasonable risk of harm to the youth, who was a licensed driver, which the youth should have been able to appreciate. Hayes v.

        This section is liberally construed by the courts to carry out, if possible, the charitable purposes of the donor of the trust, and no such trust will be permitted to fail for want of a trustee. State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patridge, 198 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 403</cite>, 248 S.W. 1056, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 483</cite> (Ky. 1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the policy of the law to encourage gifts and devises to charitable institutions. Gill's Ex'r v. Woman's Club of Louisville, 205 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 731</cite>, 266 S.W. 378, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 211</cite> (Ky. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Charitable bequest or devise is valid only when purposes, beneficiaries, and objects are nominated and described with reasonable certainty. Gooding v. Watson's Trustee, 235 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 562</cite>, 31 S.W.2d 919, 1930 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 412</cite> (Ky. 1930). See Thornton v. Kirtley, 249 S.W.2d 803, 1952 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 874</cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Test of validity of charitable bequest is reasonable certainty in respect to beneficiaries thereof, either individually or as class. Owens v. Owens' Ex'r, 236 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 118</cite>, 32 S.W.2d 731, 1930 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 699</cite> (Ky. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts look with favor on charitable gifts and will uphold them when it can be done consistently with established rules of law, and will protect them from assault. Kentucky Christian Missionary Soc. v. Moren, 267 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 358</cite>, 102 S.W.2d 335, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 326</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Charitable bequest will be upheld if bounty can be applied to any single object within a specified class of beneficiaries, or if it can be upheld without violating any rule of law, principle of justice, or public policy. Bush's Ex'r v. Mackoy, 267 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 614</cite>, 103 S.W.2d 95, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 370</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where testator designates neither class nor object of charitable bequest, and leaves choice to the trustee, the bequest fails under law as an attempt to delegate testator’s authority to make the will. Bush's Ex'r v. Mackoy, 267 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 614</cite>, 103 S.W.2d 95, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 370</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section should receive a construction similar to that given the English statute which is that devises made for charitable uses will be sustained as valid trusts and the rule against perpetuities does not apply; thus, a valid charity is established where the purpose for which it is created is maintenance of a public cemetery but this section does not prevent the state from requiring a nonprofit cemetery corporation to pay unemployment compensation tax. Lexington Cemetery Co. v. Commonwealth, 297 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 851</cite>, 181 S.W.2d 699, 1944 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 839</cite> (Ky. 1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        All the limitations applicable to private trusts are not applicable to charitable trusts. Young v. Redmon's Trustee, 300 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 418</cite>, 189 S.W.2d 401, 1945 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 560</cite> (Ky. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the purposes of the charity are made reasonably certain by the instrument creating it, the beneficiaries may be designated by class, leaving particular beneficiaries within the class to be determined by the trustee. Druker v. Levy, 262 S.W.2d 681, 1953 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1117</cite> (Ky. 1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Charitable gifts are favored and are valid if the purpose and the beneficiaries thereof are pointed out with reasonable certainty. Davis v. Cary, 429 S.W.2d 411, 1968 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 752</cite> (Ky. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (1) of this section does not require any statement of purpose or object in a devise to any organizations which are specifically named because the designation of the particular organization carries with it the implication that the objects of the testator and the objects of the organization selected are the same. Bank of Maysville v. Calvert, 481 S.W.2d 24, 1972 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 208</cite> (Ky. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (2) of this section validates devises for charitable purposes even where the devise is not made to any specific entity as long as the devise points out with reasonable certainty the purposes of the charity and the beneficiaries thereof. Bank of Maysville v. Calvert, 481 S.W.2d 24, 1972 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 208</cite> (Ky. 1972).

       <p>
        A devise to wife for life then to university in trust with proceeds to be used for education of descendants of two (2) named persons was not a charitable trust. Johnson v. De Pauw University, 116 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 671</cite>, 76 S.W. 851, 25 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 950</cite>, 1903 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 246</cite> (Ky. 1903).

       <p>
        A testamentary trust to establish and maintain an orphans’ asylum for the maintenance and education of the orphan children under 17 years of age of members of a secret society is a “public charity,” and valid, within this section relating to gifts to charity. Green's Adm'r v. Fidelity Trust Co., 134 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 311</cite>, 120 S.W. 283, 1909 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 376</cite> (Ky. 1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conveyance of land to organization for the purpose of a lodge room, church and a graveyard created a valid trust for charitable purpose of the kind described in this section. Tate v. Woodyard, 145 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 613</cite>, 140 S.W. 1044, 1911 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 914</cite> (Ky. 1911).

       <p>
        Charitable gifts are (1) gifts for eleemosynary purposes, (2) gifts for educational purposes, (3) gifts for religious purposes, and (4) gifts for public purposes, and humane purpose is the basis of all valid charities. Neptune Fire Engine &amp; Hose Co. v. Board of Education, 166 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 1</cite>, 178 S.W. 1138, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 628</cite> (Ky. 1915), overruled,

       </p>
       <p>
        Bequest for maintenance of burial lot of testatrix was for a humane purpose as provided by this section and was valid. Street v. Cave Hill Inv. Co., 191 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 422</cite>, 230 S.W. 536, 1921 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 326</cite> (Ky. 1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        A trust created for the use and benefit of a dog was for a “humane purpose” within this section, although it did not create a charity in its strict technical sense. Willett v. Willett, 197 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 663</cite>, 247 S.W. 739, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 685</cite> (Ky. 1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a clear distinction between a charity and a humane purpose as charity extends to every one of a class, while it is a humane purpose which moves a person to take care of or feed a single hungry person, bird or dog. Willett v. Willett, 197 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 663</cite>, 247 S.W. 739, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 685</cite> (Ky. 1923).

        Devise of property to Society of Soul Winners to constitute a fund the interest from which should be used in the prosecution of the objects of the society which are to help the mountain people by employing preachers and teachers to instruct them and help them build churches and school houses is valid, as such objects are sufficiently certain within the meaning of this section. Goldberg v. Home Missions of Presbyterian Church, 197 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 724</cite>, 248 S.W. 219, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 737</cite> (Ky. 1923).

        A bequest to be applied for masses to be celebrated for the repose of soul of testator after his decease was a charitable use; being an act of public worship, it was for a religious purpose, general to the public in nature. Obrecht v. Pujos, 206 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 751</cite>, 268 S.W. 564, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1051</cite> (Ky. 1925).

       </p>
       <p>
        A devise to a trustee for the benefit of a Young Women’s Christian Association in a certain city when one was properly organized and giving the trustee exclusive power to determine when such had been properly organized was valid. Russell v. Tyler, 224 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 511</cite>, 6 S.W.2d 707, 1928 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 642</cite> (Ky. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Charity is gift for benefit of indefinite number of persons, either by bringing their minds or hearts under influence of education or religion, by relieving bodies from disease, suffering, or constraint, by assisting them to establish themselves in life, or by erecting public buildings or works or otherwise lessening burdens of government and it is immaterial whether the purpose is called charitable in the gift itself, if it is so described as to show that it is charitable in its nature. Goode's Adm'r v. Goode, 238 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 620</cite>, 38 S.W.2d 691, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 305</cite> (Ky. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether the uses of a trust are charitable, equity will look to the purposes to which the trust fund is to be devoted and the ends that may be attained by proper administration of that fund rather than to motive actuating the testator or donor. Goode's Adm'r v. Goode, 238 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 620</cite>, 38 S.W.2d 691, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 305</cite> (Ky. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        In making determination as to whether trust comes within permitted uses as set out in this section, court is not bound by strict letter of the law but may take into account other uses not specifically named but which come within the spirit, equity and analogy of the law. Goode's Adm'r v. Goode, 238 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 620</cite>, 38 S.W.2d 691, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 305</cite> (Ky. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of trust fund for the higher education of young people in three (3) counties named in will and for trustees of testator’s church to be used by them to carry on and foster the manifold purposes of the church are permitted by this section. Goode's Adm'r v. Goode, 238 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 620</cite>, 38 S.W.2d 691, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 305</cite> (Ky. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        A test of public charitable trust is indefiniteness of ultimate beneficiaries, for, if they are confined too particularly, the trust becomes a private one. Kentucky Christian Missionary Soc. v. Moren, 267 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 358</cite>, 102 S.W.2d 335, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 326</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Essential feature of trust for charitable use is that beneficiaries are uncertain, although they should be of a class described in general language. Kentucky Christian Missionary Soc. v. Moren, 267 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 358</cite>, 102 S.W.2d 335, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 326</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Devise of 500 acres of land to church in trust for purpose of maintaining the Church House was not a grant for a charitable or humane purpose, as distinguished from a grant for religious purposes, notwithstanding that the Church House was a residence not used for worship but only as a meeting place for various church organizations. Letcher's Trustee v. Letcher, 302 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 448</cite>, 194 S.W.2d 984, 1946 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 696</cite> (Ky. 1946).

       <p>
        A devise for the erection of a monument over the graves of testator’s family consisting of the testator and his wife was a devise for a humane purpose under the law authorizing charitable devises, and was valid.
    Ford v. Ford, 13 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 183</cite> (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        A bequest of $3,000 to the Roman Catholic Bishop of Louisville “to be invested, and the income of which to be applied in rewards of merit to pupils in the parochial poor schools in L.” was certain and valid as the class to be benefited was plainly expressed, the intention unmistakable, the bequest could be readily carried out by the named trustee, under the supervision of the court, if necessary, and the object was a charitable one.
    Coleman v. O'Leary's Ex'r, 114 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 388</cite>, 70 S.W. 1068, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1248</cite>, 1902 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 169</cite> (Ky. 1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        A bequest to a named bishop for masses for the repose of the souls of testator and named members of his family was a valid charity enforceable by the court on application of the heirs for, while testator might have had a belief it would benefit his soul or the souls of others doing penance for their sins, it would also have been a benefit to all others who might have attended or participated in it.
    Coleman v. O'Leary's Ex'r, 114 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 388</cite>, 70 S.W. 1068, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1248</cite>, 1902 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 169</cite> (Ky. 1902).

        Where deed conveying property to hospital association organized for purpose of accepting certain property for operation of hospital as monument to memory of grantor’s wife provided for reversion to grantor on failure of association to carry out the conditions set out in the deed and property later became unfit for hospital purposes, trust was not violated by arrangement under which association deeded property to county and county was to erect hospital and lease it to association as operating agent.

        The ministerial power of the English chancellor which was the progenitor of the cy pres doctrine does not exist in any American magistrate, judicial or ministerial, and none can exist until conferred by the legislature and the cy pres doctrine as a judicial doctrine has never been in force in this state.

        This section has uniformly been given a liberal construction by the courts so as to carry out, if possible, the humane and charitable purposes of the donor of the trust, and further, that no such trust will be permitted to fail for the want of a trustee, but it has not adopted the cy pres doctrine, permitting the trust funds to be expended for a charitable purpose though no specific one is expressly named.

        A bequest to the “Children Orphans Home at Lynden” did not lapse by reason of the dissolution of the original Kentucky Children’s Home Society, a private corporation, and the taking over of its property by the state department of welfare, where the change occurred before testator’s death and was a matter of public knowledge, and it appeared from the will that the testator was primarily concerned with the result to be accomplished in the administration of the charity rather than with the ownership of the property employed.

        The cy pres doctrine will be applied in Kentucky to the extent that it authorizes liberal rules of construction to uphold charitable bequests. It has never been adopted by Kentucky courts to the extent of supplying a beneficiary or purpose where these objects are not expressed by the donor, but it is fully operative where a general charitable intent is manifest and the object of the charity is identified or ascertainable, although the particular method of administering the charity is inadequate, illegal, or inappropriate, or happens to fail.

        A testator who resided in Kentucky devised his property, situated in Kentucky, in trust to establish and maintain in a sister state an orphans’ asylum for the nurture and education of orphans under the age of 17 years of members of a secret society of the sister state. Courts of equity of Kentucky would administer the trust in Kentucky, and require the trustee in Kentucky to protect the trust by paying the income over to a trustee appointed by the sister state, on it being found necessary to have two (2) trustees to carry the trust into effect.

        Codicil imposing upon the devisee accepting a trust the duty to enter into terms with executors, binding and obligating devisee to establish and maintain an orphans’ home in perpetuity upon terms satisfactory to executors did not give executors power to defeat her purpose by imposing unreasonable conditions upon trustee and court properly declined to require trustee to agree not to operate or maintain any other similar institution in the state as a condition to receiving the trust funds.

        Trust to church of which testator was a member to be used by its trustees to carry on and foster the manifold purposes of the church was not invalid because a part of the income was to be paid to the church trustees to be expended by them in the manner they deemed proper as the fund did not go to the trustees as individuals but as trustees of and for the church and it was not to be presumed that they would use the fund for purposes other than to carry on and foster the proper activities of the church.

        The general rule is that where property is devised for charitable uses, the donor or a residuary legatee has no interest in the trust property save as one of the public and can only question the activities of the trustee by a bill preferred on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, in conjunction with the attorney general.

       <p>
        Where a provision in the instrument creating a charitable trust as to the use of the property is merely a direction, and not a condition, a breach of duty by the trustee in using the property for a purpose other than the one designated will not work a forfeiture in favor of the heirs of the donor, but will furnish grounds for an action by the attorney general or the beneficiaries of the trust to compel compliance with the terms of the trust.

       <p>
        Where testator placed property in trust to maintain school for indigent girls but, because of decrease in value or trust assets, school could not be maintained and property was used merely as home for indigent girls, such departure from terms of trust did not work a forfeiture in favor of testator’s heirs.

        Whether a provision in an instrument creating a charitable trust is a direction or a condition depends upon the intent of the settlor and, where the language used indicates that the settlor had a general charitable intent, the use of the property for a charitable purpose other than the one designated will not work a forfeiture.

        A bequest of a fund to a trustee, to be expended in securing an evangelist, and in the advancement of the principles of primitive Christianity as taught by the Christian church, is valid as a charitable bequest, as the purposes of the charity and the beneficiaries thereof are pointed out with reasonable certainty.

        A residuary bequest of remainder of estate in trust to the “Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Louisville and three others to be chosen by him, for the establishment of a home for poor Catholic men” was not too indefinite as to the location in which the home should be established, and from which the beneficiaries should be selected, as equity could uphold a charitable trust by the court taking control of the fund, and directing its management, and settling who was the beneficiary thereof, and the will would be construed as requiring the establishment of the home in Louisville, and the selection of beneficiaries from that diocese.

        Beneficiaries may be designated only as a class with particular objects of the testator’s benefaction to be determined by trustee appointed to administer the trust and such is a valid charitable trust, for the testator has chosen the class of beneficiaries and granted a power to the trustee to select only the individual members of the class.

        Bequest “to the needy widows’ home or children’s home” with no kind of identification was not invalid for failure to point out beneficiary with reasonable certainty as it was a specific bequest for unidentified classes within a designated territory, it being understood as intending either a widows’ home or a children’s home of testatrix’s county.

        Trust of residue of estate to “the Catholic Diocese of Kentucky, at Louisville, Kentucky, for the education of young priests” was valid devise to the Roman Catholic Bishop at Louisville, where the Catholic Diocese of Kentucky at Louisville had been created as a corporation sole under the name of the “Roman Catholic Bishop of Louisville,” although there were other denominations in Louisville using the words “Catholic” and “Bishop.” Shrader v.

        Where the testator left a devise to the Widows and Orphans Home of the Church of Christ, Louisville, Ky., and no such institution existed but there was a home for widows and orphans called The Christian Church Homes of Kentucky, the will clearly exhibited a charitable purpose, and it named a distinct class of persons who were to be the beneficiaries, and the fact that the institution was not named with technical accuracy in the will would not justify violating the testator’s charitable purpose.

        Testamentary trust specifying the Southern Presbyterian Church as the object of testatrix’s bounty, and investing her executors and trustees with discretion to select the particular activities of the church to which the property should be applied, was sufficiently specific to come within this section.

        Purpose of the charity was pointed out with reasonable certainty where devise was to college controlled by a church for the establishment of an educational fund or endowment for the support of a Bible chair for education of preachers of the gospel and to teach designated doctrines of the church which doctrines were then being taught by the college and were held by testator and a faction of the church although not by all members.

        When a devise is made to a society or organization such as a named missionary society founded for and engaged in a specific work without setting out in the will a different use to which the devise is to be applied, the mere devise sufficiently indicates the purpose intended and may be enforced in equity.

        A clause in a will which directs the executor to dispose of the residuary estate according to his judgment for good and charitable purposes is invalid for failing, as required by this section, to point out the purpose and beneficiary.

        A gift to charity, designating no beneficiary or charitable purpose, was void under this section, for uncertainty. Simmon's Ex'r v. Hunt, 171 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 397</cite>, 188 S.W. 495, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 380</cite> (Ky. 1916).

       <p>
        An agreement of owners that money be used for charitable purposes, constituting a gift void for uncertainty, could not support a valid executed trust, by the one named as trustee bequeathing it in trust for named beneficiaries. Simmon's Ex'r v. Hunt, 171 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 397</cite>, 188 S.W. 495, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 380</cite> (Ky. 1916).

        The purpose of the charity was uncertain where will provided trustee was to pay the principal of the trust on the death of the life tenant to such charitable organizations in two (2) designated cities, excluding educational institutions, “as in its then judgment may be right and proper.” Gooding v. Watson's Trustee, 235 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 562</cite>, 31 S.W.2d 919, 1930 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 412</cite> (Ky. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        That part of bequest which provided that trustee in alternative might distribute the funds “as he thinks best wherever he thinks needed” was clearly invalid for want of compliance with the law and because it was in effect but the delegation of authority to make the will and dispose of the property according to the trustee’s purposes rather than the testator’s. Bush's Ex'r v. Mackoy, 267 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 614</cite>, 103 S.W.2d 95, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 370</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where testator designates neither class nor object of charitable bequest, and leaves choice to the trustee, the bequest fails under law as an attempt to delegate testator’s authority to make the will.

       <p>
        Where will stated testator would go to Germany to select institution to receive bequest and would designate the selected institution by a codicil, but testator did not make the contemplated trip nor add a codicil, the unfilled expressed intentions were sufficient to throw a cloud of doubt on the attempted gift.

       <p>
        Where will provided trustees should determine worthy educational or charitable institutions or individuals and gave trustees sole discretion to determine beneficiaries, it was void as the particular charity to be benefited was uncertain.

        Where husband had been convicted of a felony for taking the life of his wife, he was barred from asserting any interest he would receive as a surviving tenant in residence owned by them. Therefore, the entire value of the residence was a part of the estate of the wife. First Kentucky Trust Co. v.

        The conviction of wife of decedent for reckless homicide, a felony homicide, in causing decedent’s death operated as a matter of law under this section to forfeit any rights she otherwise might have had to decedent’s CSRS pension benefits and consequently such benefits were payable to decedent’s children by a previous marriage.

        Where husband, who held insured property with wife as tenants by entireties, murdered wife, neither he nor his heirs could claim all of the property under a right of survivorship; equity dictates under the circumstances that the property be divided equally between the husband or his heirs and the heirs of the deceased spouse. This result was not in contravention of this section which merely preempts operation of the right of survivorship in such situations. Heuser v. Cohen, 655 S.W.2d 9, 1982 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Where a husband caused the death of his wife, and one (1) month later certain residential property that they had held as tenants by the entirety was totally destroyed by fire, equitable principles dictated that the husband was entitled to retain a one-half (1/2) interest in the casualty insurance proceeds and the other half would be paid to the estate of the deceased wife. Heuser v. Cohen, 630 S.W.2d 79, 1982 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 296</cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), op. withdrawn, 655 S.W.2d 9, 1982 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 205</cite> (Ky. Ct.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Proceeds of insurance policies on the life of wife killed by husband, which were owned by husband and payable to him as beneficiary, were correctly included in wife’s estate under § 2042(1), Internal Revenue Code, on the basis of this section even though the contingent beneficiaries were the husband or his executors or administrators, since husband was alive at the time of wife’s death and no executors or administrators existed. First Kentucky Trust Co. v. United States, 737 F.2d 557, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 21268 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1984</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband killed wife, to the extent that the wife’s will named a residuary legatee other than her husband, the proceeds of insurance policies on the wife of which husband was the beneficiary were payable under this section to the executor of the wife’s estate for distribution to such legatee subject to the payment of debts and other claims and charges against the estate; however if the husband was the only named legatee, the insurance proceeds would pass as intestate property to wife’s heirs and as such would also be subject to any claims and charges against the estate. First Kentucky Trust Co. v. United States, 737 F.2d 557, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 21268 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1984</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since federal law rather than state law governed action where natural children of deceased were seeking benefits of deceased’s federal life insurance where deceased was killed by wife who had been named as beneficiary, this section was not relevant in determining the receipt of the life insurance benefits. Mounts v. United States, 838 F. Supp. 1187, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16996 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1993</cite>).

       <p>
        With regard to husband who was convicted of killing his wife, where he contended that until his appeal is concluded, he cannot technically be considered convicted under this section the better rule would be to allow the provisions of this section to apply as soon as a conviction occurs, regardless of whether an appeal is taken.

        A court of chancery will restrain equitable waste only when it is shown that the particular tenant has been guilty of a wanton and unconscientious abuse of his rights, ruinous to the interests of other parties. Continental Fuel Co. v. Haden, 182 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 8</cite>, 206 S.W. 8, 1918 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 308</cite> (Ky. 1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is very similar to, and was undoubtedly modeled after, the old English statute regarding waste, and should be construed as the English statute was construed, which statute directed that all tenants, except guardians who forfeited their wardship and paid single damages, lose and forfeit the place where waste was committed and also pay treble damages to the person having the inheritance. Salyer's Guardian v. Keeton, 214 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 643</cite>, 283 S.W. 1015, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 397</cite> (Ky. 1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Modern action for waste is in nature of action on case, and is action ex delicto. Cohen v. Reif, 223 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 603</cite>, 4 S.W.2d 388, 1928 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 393</cite> (Ky. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has been consistently construed as not authorizing a contingent remainderman to maintain an action for waste against a life tenant because it could not be told then whether he would suffer any injury. Louisville Cooperage Co. v. Rudd, 276 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 721</cite>, 124 S.W.2d 1063, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 562</cite> (Ky. 1938).

        Waste is an act done by a tenant without license or authority whereby a lasting damage is done to the freehold.

        An action at law for permissive waste will not lie under this section. Smith v. Mattingly, 96 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 228</cite>, 28 S.W. 503, 16 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 418</cite>, 1894 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 118</cite> (Ky. 1894).

       <p>
        This section applies only when there is voluntary waste, leaving permissive waste to be dealt with in equity. Continental Fuel Co. v. Haden, 182 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 8</cite>, 206 S.W. 8, 1918 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 308</cite> (Ky. 1918).

        Law on subject of waste relates only to voluntary waste. Collins v. Security Trust Co., 206 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 30</cite>, 266 S.W. 910, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 277</cite> (Ky. 1924).

        3. Oral Consent.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Oral consent of landlord does not protect a tenant from an action for waste. Abel v. Wuesten, 143 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 513</cite>, 136 S.W. 867, 1911 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 417</cite> (Ky. 1911).

       <p>
        Under this section the oral consent of the remainderman would not release the life tenant from damages for waste. Adams v. Adams, 371 S.W.2d 637, 1963 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 108</cite> (Ky. 1963).

        4. Taking Timber, Coal or Minerals.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Life tenants may not take and appropriate timber, coal, or other minerals except for the upkeep of the property or for household purposes, unless the instrument creating the life estate expressly permits the commercial use thereof, or permission can be inferred from the fact that the creator of the life estate appropriated the premises to that use. Smith v. Harris, 276 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 529</cite>, 124 S.W.2d 786, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 555</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law is well settled that a life tenant may not cut timber except such as might be needed for maintaining the improvements or required for domestic purposes. Adams v. Adams, 371 S.W.2d 637, 1963 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 108</cite> (Ky. 1963).

        5. Alteration of Buildings.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Alterations tenant made were so radical they substantially changed character of building, and constituted waste. Abel v. Wuesten, 143 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 513</cite>, 136 S.W. 867, 1911 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 417</cite> (Ky. 1911).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where tenant for years took coal from mine in such a way as to render mine useless, if continued, this constituted waste, and landlord could cancel lease. Mullins v. Dees, 124 S.W. 828, 1910 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 672</cite> (Ky. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        As tenant is liable to an action of waste, the lease may be forfeited on ground of waste. Abel v. Wuesten, 143 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 513</cite>, 136 S.W. 867, 1911 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 417</cite> (Ky. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing short of such voluntary waste as a wanton or destructive act committed against the leasehold could be equitable ground for cancellation or forfeiture of a lease. Addison v. Brandenburg, 202 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 580</cite>, 260 S.W. 381, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 767</cite> (Ky. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Waste, which was chiefly such as grew out of nonuse of a mine, was not ground for forfeiture of a lease. Addison v. Brandenburg, 202 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 580</cite>, 260 S.W. 381, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 767</cite> (Ky. 1924).

        Vested remainderman was not estopped to prevent waste by life tenant by her silence while tenant prepared to commit waste, as tenant had constructive notice from records of remainderman’s claim.

       <p>
        A contingent remainderman is not authorized by law to resist recovery for lumber cut from land and sold by life tenant, nor to maintain action against life tenant for waste. Taylor v. Harvey, 100 S.W. 258, 30 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1045</cite> (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        This and allied sections have been consistently construed as not authorizing a contingent remainderman to maintain an action for waste against a life tenant, because it could not be told then whether he would suffer any injury. Louisville Cooperage Co. v. Rudd, 276 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 721</cite>, 124 S.W.2d 1063, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 562</cite> (Ky. 1938). See Fisher's Ex'r v.

       </p>
       <p>
        A contingent remainderman may bring an action at law against a stranger for waste committed before the termination of the life estate, and the trial court may use its powers as a court until the contingent remainder vests, and then apportion the fund between the parties entitled thereto, but the life tenant and other contingent remaindermen should be made parties to the action. Louisville Cooperage Co. v. Rudd, 276 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 721</cite>, 124 S.W.2d 1063, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 562</cite> (Ky. 1938). See Fisher's Ex'r v.

        The right of a contingent remainderman to maintain such action against a third person must exist outside the law. Louisville Cooperage Co. v.

        7. Permissive Waste.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A remainderman or reversioner cannot maintain an ordinary action in the nature of trespass on the case against a life tenant to recover damages for permissive waste; his remedy is by suit in equity. Smith v. Mattingly, 96 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 228</cite>, 28 S.W. 503, 16 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 418</cite>, 1894 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 118</cite> (Ky. 1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs, in an action at law to recover for voluntary waste, having averred acts of permissive waste by defendants, were entitled to a transfer to equity of their cause. Smith v. Mattingly, 96 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 228</cite>, 28 S.W. 503, 16 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 418</cite>, 1894 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 118</cite> (Ky. 1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiffs owned the remainder in certain lands as joint tenants, they were properly joined as plaintiffs in a suit for permissive waste against the life tenant’s administrator for waste. Prescott v. Grimes, 143 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 191</cite>, 136 S.W. 206, 1911 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 374</cite> (Ky. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        An action for permissive waste, the failure to take reasonable care of the premises, will lie after the life tenant’s death by the heirs and next of kin as remaindermen, although during the continuance of the life estate such heirs occupied the position of contingent remaindermen and the statute of limitations started to run at life tenant’s death. Fisher's Ex'r v. Haney, 180 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 257</cite>, 202 S.W. 495, 1918 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 40</cite> (Ky. 1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        A petition against personal representative of tenant per autre vie in equity for permissive waste seeking damages or in alternative that land and improvements be restored was not premature since it accrued before the life estate expired and it was error to sustain demurrer on ground that action was premature. Collins v. Security Trust Co., 206 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 30</cite>, 266 S.W. 910, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 277</cite> (Ky. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tenant’s heirs and devisees of the tenant per autre vie are not necessary parties to a suit in equity for damages for permissive waste against the tenant’s personal representative. Collins v. Security Trust Co., 206 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 30</cite>, 266 S.W. 910, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 277</cite> (Ky. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        While limitation for permissive waste does not run against the remainderman, during the life of the life tenant, the person who holds under the life tenant may not commit waste and if he commits waste an action may be brought by the remainderman against him. Burns v. Dillon, 226 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 82</cite>, 9 S.W.2d 1095, 1928 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 12</cite> (Ky. 1928).

        Looking at the manner in which the life tenant neglected the property of 450 acres and the improvements thereon as exhibited in the evidence of the witnesses who had opportunity to know its condition when he took it and at his death, the finding of the lower court, in an action by the remaindermen, for damages of $4,500 for waste was substantially correct.

        Homestead statutes do not create an estate in land but only give to the owner of the homestead the right to use, occupy and enjoy it as a home free from disturbance by the heirs, creditors or others and although a widow could have prevented lessees under a lease executed by her husband’s adult children from entering upon the land and interfering with her use of the surface she could not enjoin them, in an action brought after oil was discovered in paying quantities at great expense to lessees, from operating the oil and gas wells where she permitted them to enter, explore for gas and oil and they paid her damages for her right of use and occupancy of the homestead and the injunctive relief would be of small benefit to her and would operate to the great injury of lessees.

        It is thoroughly established in this state that the one in possession of surface under a separated title thereto holds possession of the minerals as trustee for legal owner of same and it was not necessary to allege eviction to sue on warranty under this rule.

        At common law and by law, possession of surface does not give possession of mineral rights which have been sold and separated from surface estate, but presumption prevails that holder is trustee of minerals for use and benefit of owner.

        A “free gas clause” in an oil and gas lease, allowing the lessor the right to sufficient gas for domestic use on the premises, is a covenant running with and attached to the surface of the land, and cannot be taken advantage of by the owner of the oil, gas and mineral rights. Warfield Natural Gas Co. v. Small, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 347</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 488, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 169</cite> (Ky. 1940).

       <p>
        Lease executed by owner of oil, gas and mineral rights, without referring to a “free gas clause” in favor of the surface owner contained in an earlier lease, did not destroy surface owner’s right to free gas for domestic use on the premises. Warfield Natural Gas Co. v. Small, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 347</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 488, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 169</cite> (Ky. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under a “free gas clause” permitting lessor to use gas for domestic purposes, and authorizing the lessee to shut off the gas for failure to use reasonable economy, lessee had right by notifying lessor to shut off the gas in order to compel lessor to pay for any amount of gas used in excess of reasonable amount needed for domestic purposes, and lessor could enjoin lessee from interfering with his use of such a reasonable amount. Warfield Natural Gas Co. v. Small, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 347</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 488, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 169</cite> (Ky. 1940).

       <p>
        Where oil and gas lease contained “free gas clause” in favor of surface owner, a later deed, conveying the surface but reserving to the grantor the oil, gas and mineral rights and those rights covered by the lease, did not destroy surface owner’s right to free gas for domestic use on the premises, since that right was a covenant running with the surface and could not be of any value to the owner of the oil, gas and mineral rights. Warfield Natural Gas Co. v. Small, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 347</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 488, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 169</cite> (Ky. 1940).

        9. — Continuity.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Judgment against claimants of surface in suit to quiet title in federal district court broke continuity of their possession, and was conclusive as against purchaser from them. Tennis Coal Co. v. Sackett, 172 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 729</cite>, 190 S.W. 130, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 280</cite> (Ky. 1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a vendor who has defective title to land properly conveys the mineral rights and continues in possession of the land, the continuity of such possession is not broken, but inures to benefit of grantee. J. B. Gathright Land Co. v. Begley, 200 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 808</cite>, 255 S.W. 837, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 202</cite> (Ky. 1923).

        10. — Adverse.
       </h5>
       <p>
        One holding land cannot hold mineral rights therein by adverse possession, and limitations do not run against either the owner of surface or the owner of mineral rights. Farnsworth v. Barret, 146 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 556</cite>, 142 S.W. 1049, 1912 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 104</cite> (Ky. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        If vendors in possession were in possession of the land when they sold the coal or minerals to the vendee and thereafter remained in possession until they had been in the adverse possession of the land for the statutory period counting from their first acquiring actual possession of the land, the title of vendee was valid, but if, before the statutory period had expired, they had abandoned the possession or been evicted by the owners of the paramount title, then the title of vendee failed. Tennis Coal Co. v. Sackett, 172 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 729</cite>, 190 S.W. 130, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 280</cite> (Ky. 1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        The opening of a coal bank or oil and gas wells by the surface owner, for the purpose of taking a small quantity of minerals for domestic purposes and not with the avowed intention of acquiring title to the whole mineral estate, does not start limitations running against the owner of the minerals. Hoskins v. Northern Lee Oil &amp; Gas Co., 194 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 628</cite>, 240 S.W. 377, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 226</cite> (Ky. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutes of limitations do not run in favor of the owner and holder of the surface against the fee owner of the mineral estate in the same land, and the only way the statute can be started running in favor of the surface holder as against the mineral, is by the former taking actual possession of the mineral under claim of right, by opening mines or wells and operating the same and when this possession has continued for the statutory period, title to the mineral by adverse possession is perfected. Hoskins v. Northern Lee Oil &amp; Gas Co., 194 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 628</cite>, 240 S.W. 377, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 226</cite> (Ky. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        To start limitations running against the owner of a mineral estate in land, the entry into possession of the mineral estate must be accompanied by such open, notorious, and adverse acts as would be sufficient to set the statutes running in favor of one in possession of the surface of the land. Hoskins v. Northern Lee Oil &amp; Gas Co., 194 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 628</cite>, 240 S.W. 377, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 226</cite> (Ky. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment quieting title interrupted all prior adverse holdings of the minerals under the land so as to deprive any subsequent adverse holder of the right to tack to his holding any such prior holding so as to complete the statutory period. Asher v. Gibson, 198 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 285</cite>, 248 S.W. 862, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 438</cite> (Ky. 1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        The possession of grantees, under absolute deed without reservation of mineral rights from a grantor who received the property by deed reserving the mineral rights to his grantor, did not constitute adverse possession in the minerals. Asher v. Gibson, 198 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 285</cite>, 248 S.W. 862, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 438</cite> (Ky. 1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule that possession, such as the nature of the real estate will admit of and such as is necessary for the use it is applied to, is sufficient, applies to the adverse possession of minerals the same as to the possession of the surface. Asher v. Gibson, 198 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 285</cite>, 248 S.W. 862, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 438</cite> (Ky. 1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for surface owner to acquire title by adverse possession of minerals in place, separated from surface, he must not only open and work mines, but actual possession and work must be continuous, uninterrupted, open, and notorious for the statutory period. McPherson v. Thompson, 203 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 35</cite>, 261 S.W. 853, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 846</cite> (Ky. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        After deed to mineral rights had been recorded it brought home to all the world and the defendants occupying surface, notice of the ownership by grantee of the minerals just as fully as if grantee had a notice of his ownership with a copy of the deed attached served upon each defendant occupying the surface by the sheriff and caused such copy to be read to them by him in the presence of witnesses. Piney Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Scott, 258 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 51</cite>, 79 S.W.2d 394, 1934 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 577</cite> (Ky. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        After grantee recorded deed to mineral rights in proper office grantor retaining ownership of surface and all persons claiming under him became, were and remained trustees for grantee of minerals and those claiming under him and they could never no matter how long they held the surface disseise grantee and those claiming these minerals under him without openly disavowing or repudiating the trust and giving to the owner of mineral estate notice thereof. Piney Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Scott, 258 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 51</cite>, 79 S.W.2d 394, 1934 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 577</cite> (Ky. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Execution of oil and gas leases by owners of the surface and collection of rent under them would not be an adverse possession of the oil and gas where there had been a previous severance of the ownership of the minerals from the surface. Smith v. Graf, 259 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 456</cite>, 82 S.W.2d 461, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 323</cite> (Ky. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where driller of oil and gas well held a lease from the owner of the minerals as well as a lease from the surface owner, the drilling of the well did not constitute adverse possession by surface owner. Smith v. Graf, 259 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 456</cite>, 82 S.W.2d 461, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 323</cite> (Ky. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Limitation does not run in favor of owner or holder of surface estate against owner of mineral estate merely because of ownership or possession of surface for any length of time. Curtis-Jordan Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Mullins, 269 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 514</cite>, 106 S.W.2d 979, 1936 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 780</cite> (Ky. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Owner of surface estate may acquire title by adverse possession of minerals separated from surface but to do so he must not only open and work mine, but actual possession and work must be uninterrupted, continuous, open, and notorious for statutory period. Curtis-Jordan Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Mullins, 269 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 514</cite>, 106 S.W.2d 979, 1936 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 780</cite> (Ky. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        After severance of the mineral title one who acquires possession of the surface from the same grantor is deemed to hold possession of the minerals as trustee for the holder of the mineral title and, in the absence of an explicit disclaimer and clear repudiation of this existing relationship in a manner sufficiently open and notorious to bring home to the mineral owner knowledge or notice of the hostility of the surface holder’s possession, the surface holder, being a trustee in possession, can never acquire the title of his cestui que trust by any length of possession for his possession never becomes adverse. Kentucky River Coal Corp. v. Singleton, 36 F. Supp. 123, 1941 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3845 (D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1941</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Adverse possession of subsurface interests must be evidenced by notice or notorious action amounting to notice. Warfield Natural Gas Co. v. Ward, 286 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 73</cite>, 149 S.W.2d 705, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1</cite> (Ky. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        The surface owner must give the mineral owner formal notice that he is taking the minerals under an adverse claim in order to repudiate the trust and initiate limitations. Diederich v. Ware, 288 S.W.2d 643, 1956 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 270</cite> (Ky. 1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        After a severance of the minerals from the surface, any adverse possession of the surface will be deemed to be a holding in trust for the mineral owner unless trust is openly repudiated by the adverse holder. Inland Steel Co. v. Isaacs, 291 S.W.2d 522, 1956 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 374</cite> (Ky. 1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for the surface owner to obtain title by adverse possession to the minerals which constitute a severed estate, he must have openly disavowed or repudiated the trust declared by the statute and have exercised dominion over the mineral estate and brought notice thereof to the owner of that estate. Ward v. Woods, 310 S.W.2d 63, 1958 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 375</cite> (Ky. 1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the mineral estate was severed from the surface estate, adverse possession of the surface alone, no matter how long continued, would not create title to the minerals. Griffith v. J. C. Miller Oil Co., 349 S.W.2d 833, 1961 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 72</cite> (Ky. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff landowners took title to property with knowledge of reservation by original owner of mineral rights to subsurface coal and mined the property for domestic use only, there was not sufficient repudiation of possessory trust for benefit of owner imposed by this section to establish adverse possession entitling them to title to the coal rights. Brockman v. Jones, 610 S.W.2d 943, 1980 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 417</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        For surface estate owners to adversely possess the mineral estate, they must continuously and uninterruptedly hold the mine or seam for the statutory period and if they should cease operating or removing the minerals, the statute stops running. East Kentucky Energy Corp. v. Niece, 774 S.W.2d 458, 1989 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 99</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Surface owner, holding severed mineral estate acquired from common grantor as trustee, can only acquire title by adverse possession by unequivocal repudiation of the trust, given in such a way as to unmistakably place mineral estate owner on notice. Great W. Land Mgmt. v. Slusher, 939 S.W.2d 865, 1996 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 71</cite> (Ky. 1996), modified, 1997 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 41</cite> (Ky. Mar. 27, 1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where there is a severance of the mineral estate from the surface estate, the owner of the minerals does not lose his right or his possession by any length of nonuser, nor can the owner of the surface acquire title to the minerals by his exclusive and continued occupancy of the surface merely. Scott v. Laws, 185 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 440</cite>, 215 S.W. 81, 1919 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 316</cite> (Ky. 1919).

        Owner of minerals does not lose rights as against owner of surface by mere nonuser, his title can only be defeated by acts which actually take mineral out of his possession.

        The claimant must show that he believed himself to be the owner by reason of a claim founded upon a grant from the Commonwealth; in order to do so, he must necessarily connect himself with the grant by showing that he held the title which it granted. Shaw v. Robinson, 111 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 715</cite>, 64 S.W. 620, 23 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 998</cite>, 1901 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 242</cite> (Ky. 1901).

        The general rule is that a person basing his claim on a “public record” or “title of record” must trace his title back to a patent from the Commonwealth; in this case neither party is in position to question title of the other, since they both claim title from a common source.

        Certain painting and partitions were held “permanent improvements” for which occupant was entitled to credit. Moore's Guardian v. Williamson's Ex'r, 201 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 561</cite>, 257 S.W. 711, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 340</cite> (Ky. 1923).

        Persons in possession of land under color or claim of title to mineral rights were entitled to lien against oil and gas rights for amount the well they drilled had increased value of the land but not to exceed the cost of drilling the well and connecting pipe.

        Where the parties built a dwelling on nonmarital property in which the husband owned a life estate and his daughter by a previous marriage owned the remainder, the value of the life estate in the improvements was marital property, as it resulted from the joint efforts of the parties; such value should be computed on the husband’s life expectancy at the time of the dissolution of the marriage.

The costs of improvements was not the measure of credit allowable to the occupant, but nevertheless might be considered in determining whether and to what extent the vendible value of the property had been increased.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The language in this chapter indicates that the term “cemetery” contemplates places where dead persons are buried; therefore, the trial court erred in extending the definition of cemetery to include a pet cemetery. Loid v. Kell, 844 S.W.2d 428, 1992 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 189</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court incorrectly classified the accident victim in a negligence action as a licensee rather than an invitee and should have determined the city’s duties based upon the victim’s status as an invitee when a headstone at the grave of the victim’s child in the city’s cemetery fell on the victim while the victim was visiting the grave. As an invitee, the city owed the victim a duty to exercise reasonable care to discover the hazardous condition of the headstone and either correct it or warn the victim of the danger. Johnson v. City of Versailles, 2020 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 71</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. June 12, 2020).

        Boat slip units could be considered as part of a condominium property regime under the Horizontal Property Law, because a boat slip could not constitute a unit under the plain language of the statute as it was located entirely upon navigable waters and was not an enclosed space that consisted of one or more rooms, and because the events and circumstances leading to the filing of the instant action clearly occurred prior to January 1, 2011, the newly enacted Kentucky Condominium Act was inapplicable.

       Since the purchaser of a condominium unit receives a recordable deed conveying a fee simple title to the unit and an undivided interest in the common elements, since the owner may convey or encumber the unit in any manner he wishes, but in so doing he does not jeopardize the interests of any co-owner in the project, and since each condominium unit is taxed separately and a co-owner has no responsibility for the individual debts of other co-owners, the instrument or deed conveying or transferring such ownership would be subject to the real estate transfer tax imposed by <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc142s142.050" target="_blank">KRS 142.050</a></cite>. However, where a corporation had only a 40-year lease which it would assign by an instrument of conveyance to individuals or corporations purchasing condominium units, the instrument used to transfer ownership was an assignment of a lease and was by definition not a deed; therefore the instruments conveying the leasehold interest of the corporation to individual purchasers were not subject to the real estate transfer tax imposed by <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc142s142.050" target="_blank">KRS 142.050</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-529</cite>.

Provided, however, that the master deed may provide for adjustments by the council of co-owners for contributions proportioned upon a consideration of a combination of floor area, the number of occupants, demand on public utilities and accessibility to limited common elements. No owner shall be exempt from contributing toward such expenses by waiver of the use or enjoyment of the common elements, both general and limited, or by abandonment of the unit belonging to him; provided, abatement or reduction in an owner’s contribution may be granted by the council of co-owners for a reasonable period of time, during which a unit is uninhabitable as the result of damage or destruction.

      All sums assessed by the council of co-owners but unpaid for the unit’s share of the common expenses constitute a lien on such unit prior to all other liens, except only (1) liens for taxes and assessments lawfully imposed by governmental authority against such unit, and (2) all sums unpaid on first mortgages of record. Such lien may be enforced by suit by the administrator or board of administration, acting on behalf of the unit owners, in like manner as a mortgage of real property. In any such enforcement action the unit owner shall be required to pay a reasonable rental for the unit, if so provided in the bylaws, and the plaintiff in such enforcement action shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the same. The administrator or board of administration, acting on behalf of the unit owners, shall have power, unless prohibited by the declaration, to bid in the unit at court sale, and to acquire and hold, lease, mortgage and convey the same. Suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid common expenses of an owner shall be maintainable without lien enforcement or waiving the lien securing the same.

       Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain, a condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least eighty percent (80%) of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.

The termination agreement shall specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof shall be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is situated, and is effective only upon recordation.

       In the case of a condominium containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide that all the common elements and units of the condominium shall be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement shall set forth the minimum terms of the sale.

       In the case of a condominium containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide for sale of the common elements, but shall not require that the units be sold following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or unless all the unit owners consent to the sale.
      </li>

       The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section. If any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (8) of this section. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his or her unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and his or her successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc381s381.9101" target="_self">KRS 381.9101</a></cite> to 381.9207 or the declaration.

       Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units, which were recorded before termination, may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination.

The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within thirty (30) days after distribution by unit owners of units to which twenty-five percent (25%) of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner’s interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner’s unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements; and

     <p>
      In any instrument heretofore or hereafter executed purporting to sever the surface and mineral estates or to grant a mineral estate or to grant a right to extract minerals, which fails to state or describe in express and specific terms the method of coal extraction to be employed, or where said instrument contains language subordinating the surface estate to the mineral estate, it shall be held, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, that the intention of the parties to the instrument was that the coal be extracted only by the method or methods of commercial coal extraction commonly known to be in use in Kentucky in the area affected at the time the instrument was executed, and that the mineral estate be dominant to the surface estate only for the purposes of coal extraction by the method or methods of commercial coal extraction commonly known to be in use in Kentucky in the area affected at the time the instrument was executed.

        2. Commonly Used Extraction Method.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where deed which conveyed land reserved certain mineral rights to grantor and contained no express or specific terms in pertaining to the method of coal extraction to be used and as there was no clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, it had to be held that the intention of the parties was that the coal was to be extracted only by the methods commonly used in the area affected at the time the instrument was executed, and the mineral estate was dominant to the surface estate only for the commonly known methods of commercial coal extraction, that is, for underground mining, for although there was some slight history of surface pit mining, there was no history of strip mining that would be considered commonly known to be used in the area for commercial coal extraction.

       <p>
        Where clauses in deed limited the grantor mineral owner’s rights to disturb the surface estate, required surface supports during underground mining, prohibited hydraulic mining (a form of strip mining), restricted the destruction of timber, and specified that all mining tunnels must be open for inspection by government agents, the provisions indicated that the 1937 deed was not intended to reserve for grantor strip mining rights and was not equivalent to the broad form deeds discussed in Akers v.

        When party holding deed of life estate, with power of sale of remainder executes a deed purporting to convey a fee-simple title to the whole or any part of this property, his life estate passes because he owns that and has, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc381s381.040" target="_self">KRS 381.040</a></cite>, power to convey it and the remainder passes because of the power given him in his father’s will.

        12. Construction of Instruments.
       </h5>
       <p>
        If the testator’s intention can be ascertained from the language employed in his will, that intention controls, regardless of collateral and subsidiary rules which may be employed in arriving at the intention when it is obscure. Jones v. Jones' Ex'rs, 198 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 756</cite>, 250 S.W. 92, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 559</cite> (Ky. 1923). See State Bank v.

       </p>
       <p>
        If the intention of the parties can be determined, it will control the construction of a written instrument though it is inaptly or awkwardly expressed or out of touch with other parts of the instrument.
    Hall v. Meade, 244 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 718</cite>, 51 S.W.2d 974, 1932 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 504</cite> (Ky. 1932), overruled in part, Townsend v. Cable, 378 S.W.2d 806, 1964 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 211</cite> (Ky. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule that wills must be construed, if possible, as to avoid imputing to testator an intention to die intestate as to part of his property has no application in the construction of deeds. Hopson's Trustee v. Hopson, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 181</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 365, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 156</cite> (Ky. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the rule permitting and requiring a survey of the whole instrument by the court, it was determined that it was intended to be an inter partes deed and not a testamentary paper and that grantor reserved to himself a life estate in the described premises and also a similar estate to his wife if she survived him and that the interest of his two (2) sons would commence at the death of grantee and his wife. Hays v. Kentucky West Virginia Gas Co., 290 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 174</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 376, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 357</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        If the granting clause and the habendum clause of a deed are irreconcilable, and the other parts of the deed do not make appear which the grantor intended should control, the granting clause will prevail. Ratliffe v. Ratliffe, 182 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 230</cite>, 206 S.W. 478, 1918 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 359</cite> (Ky. 1918).

        Confused and ambiguous language in deed will be construed against grantor and in favor of grantee. Campbell v. Wells, 278 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 209</cite>, 128 S.W.2d 592, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 408</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conveyances of real estate will be construed as transferring an absolute title rather than a lesser one, if the language employed is susceptible of two constructions. Campbell v. Wells, 278 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 209</cite>, 128 S.W.2d 592, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 408</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where language in deed is ambiguous, parol evidence as to surrounding conditions may be considered by the court in ascertaining the intent of the parties. Linn v. Milliken, 279 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 771</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 62, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 347</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the effect of an instrument is to sever the estate and invest the title to a certain part of it in another, it is a deed, regardless of what it is called. Terrill v. Kentucky Block Cannel Coal Co., 290 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 35</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 326, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 343</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where instrument, executed by successor of grantor of 999-year coal lease to successor of grantee of lease, purported to convey all of coal to grantee forever, with a covenant of general warranty which recited a consideration of a fixed sum, and reserved no rights in coal to grantor, the instrument was a deed and not a lease. Terrill v. Kentucky Block Cannel Coal Co., 290 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 35</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 326, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 343</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the intention of the parties is apparent from an examination of a deed from its four corners without regard to its technical and formal divisions, it will be given effect even though, in doing so, technical rules of construction will be violated. Hays v. Kentucky West Virginia Gas Co., 290 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 174</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 376, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 357</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule that an habendum creating an estate contradictory or repugnant to that given in the granting clause must be rejected is not a rule of property, but is merely a rule of construction, which will be resorted to only where the court cannot determine which of the clauses was intended to be controlling. Hays v. Kentucky West Virginia Gas Co., 290 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 174</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 376, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 357</cite> (Ky. 1942).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a deed, a reservation or exception, to be effective, must be made in favor of one (1) of the grantors and not to a stranger to the deed for a reservation in favor of a stranger is of no effect even though the deed is signed and acknowledged by him.
    Flynn v. Fike, 291 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 316</cite>, 164 S.W.2d 470, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 227</cite> (Ky. 1942), overruled in part, Townsend v. Cable, 378 S.W.2d 806, 1964 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 211</cite> (Ky. 1964).

        A misnomer will not defeat an attempted reservation or exception. Clark v. Pauley, 291 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 637</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 161, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 284</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        A reservation creates some new right in the grantor issuing out of the thing granted, while an exception withholds from the grantee title to some part of the property vested in the grantor which would otherwise pass under the deed. Clark v. Pauley, 291 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 637</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 161, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 284</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purported “reservation” of mineral rights in a deed was actually an “exception.” Clark v. Pauley, 291 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 637</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 161, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 284</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reservations or exceptions of doubtful meaning will be construed most strongly against the grantor. Clark v. Pauley, 291 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 637</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 161, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 284</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where deed purported to convey entire fee simple, but at time of conveyance grantor actually owned an undivided interest in the land, “reservation” of mineral rights in favor of grantor was effective only as to undivided portion of mineral rights equal to grantor’s undivided interest in land.

      A covenant by a grantor in a deed, “that he will warrant the property hereby conveyed,” or words of like import, or the words “with warranty,” or “with general warranty,” in any deed, have the same effect as if the grantor had covenanted that he, his heirs and personal representatives, would forever warrant and defend the property unto the grantee, his heirs, personal representatives and assigns, against the claims and demands of all persons whatever.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Under this section, a general warranty includes all common-law covenants. Waggener v. Howsley's Adm'r, 164 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 113</cite>, 175 S.W. 4, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 334</cite> (Ky. 1915). See Eli v.

       </p>
       <p>
        An unbroken covenant passes to subsequent transferees with the title, but when broken it automatically becomes a chose in action and does not pass with the transfer of title but only by express assignment. Eli v. Trent, 195 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 26</cite>, 241 S.W. 324, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 265</cite> (Ky. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no implied warranty in a deed containing covenants of special warranty. Kentucky River Coal Corp. v. Swift Coal &amp; Timber Co., 221 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 593</cite>, 299 S.W. 201, 1927 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 778</cite> (Ky. 1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        A general warranty included all common-law covenants.
    Butt v. Riffe, 78 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 352</cite>, 1880 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 19</cite> (Ky. 1880). See
    Smith v. Jones, 97 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 670</cite>, 31 S.W. 475, 17 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 456</cite>, 1895 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 228</cite> (Ky. 1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        A covenant of general warranty was sufficient to compel the grantor, before receiving the full amount of the purchase money, to pay off and discharge all outstanding unpaid liens on the property.
    Smith v. Jones, 97 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 670</cite>, 31 S.W. 475, 17 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 456</cite>, 1895 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 228</cite> (Ky. 1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        It had often been held by the Court of Appeals that a covenant of general warranty in a deed to land was in substance equivalent to the several special covenants in use under the common law, as that one was seized of the land sold, that he had good and perfect right to convey, that the land was free from incumbrances, that the grantee should quietly enjoy possession, and that the grantor would warrant and defend the title against all claims of all persons.
    Smith v. Jones, 97 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 670</cite>, 31 S.W. 475, 17 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 456</cite>, 1895 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 228</cite> (Ky. 1895).

        2. Warranty as to Quantity.
       </h5>
       <p>
        “With covenant of general warranty” in deed only applied to title, and did not warrant the number of acres conveyed. Burton v. Cowles' Adm'x, 156 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 100</cite>, 160 S.W. 782, 1913 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 381</cite> (Ky. 1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        The use of the phrase “more or less” in describing a boundary line relieves a stated distance of exactness, thereby meaning that the parties are to risk the quantity of land conveyed; it also implies a waiver of warranty as to specified quantity. Salyer v. Poulos, 276 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 143</cite>, 122 S.W.2d 996, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 522</cite> (Ky. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where deed contained covenant that grantor “is seized of a good, indefeasible estate in fee simple to the hereinafter described land,” grantee could recover for deficiency of acreage without alleging or proving an eviction. Kentucky Nat'l Park Com. v. Dennison, 281 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 61</cite>, 134 S.W.2d 973, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 9</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant purchased one tract of land from plaintiff, and an adjoining tract from group of heirs one of whom was plaintiff, and there was a deficiency of acreage in tract conveyed by plaintiff because of overlapping of tract conveyed by heirs, defendant could recover from plaintiff for deficiency notwithstanding fact that defendant knew of deficiency at time of purchasing heirs’ tract. Kentucky Nat'l Park Com. v. Dennison, 281 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 61</cite>, 134 S.W.2d 973, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 9</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        3. Breach of Warranty.
       </h5>
       <p>
        To enable a vendee to recover for breach of general warranty of title, he must allege and prove that he has been evicted or that the vendor is insolvent or a nonresident. Walker v. Robinson, 163 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 618</cite>, 174 S.W. 503, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 303</cite> (Ky. 1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        To enable a vendor to recover for breach of general warranty of title, he must allege and prove that his title be adjudged inferior in a suit at law between him and the superior title holder. Waggener v. Howsley's Adm'r, 164 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 113</cite>, 175 S.W. 4, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 334</cite> (Ky. 1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        Covenant of title in deed to land, to which grantor does not have title and to which he does not and cannot deliver possession, is breached when the conveyance is made and cause of action accrues at once. Foxwell v. Justice, 191 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 749</cite>, 231 S.W. 509, 1921 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 387</cite> (Ky. 1921). See Eli v. Trent, 195 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 26</cite>, 241 S.W. 324, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 265</cite> (Ky. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        A breach of warranty in the deed occurred immediately upon the execution of the deed since the grantor had no title in the minerals which he purported to convey and did not and could not put grantee in possession of them so consequently the warranty was immediately transformed into a chose in action and ceased to be a covenant running with the land on which a subsequent grantee could recover without assignment of the cause of action against the original warrantor. Eli v. Trent, 195 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 26</cite>, 241 S.W. 324, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 265</cite> (Ky. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        A remote grantee cannot maintain action for breach of real covenant that occurred before the grant to him; the right of action is personal to him in whose time the covenant is broken, and, unless he assigns it, he is the only person that can bring suit. Eli v. Trent, 195 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 26</cite>, 241 S.W. 324, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 265</cite> (Ky. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        While there are many Kentucky decisions holding that a remote grantee can recover on the original warranty, in every such case the breach occurred during the time of occupancy of the complainant, by an eviction or other act necessarily resulting in a breach. Eli v. Trent, 195 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 26</cite>, 241 S.W. 324, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 265</cite> (Ky. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        An action before an eviction may be maintained on the covenant that the grantor is seized of good title, if the title is defective. Hope Syndicate v. Southland Petroleum Co., 207 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 473</cite>, 269 S.W. 517, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 115</cite> (Ky. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        A vendee in possession under a general warranty deed must sue at law for any breach of warranty and may not have equitable relief of cancellation in absence of extraordinary circumstances, but a vendee not in possession, and who cannot lawfully be put in possession because vendor had no title, may sue in equity for rescission. Creech v. Jenkins, 276 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 163</cite>, 123 S.W.2d 267, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 540</cite> (Ky. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although it is the rule that to enable a vendee to recover for the breach of a general warranty of title he must allege and prove that he has been evicted, this rule does not apply to other express covenants which have been broken. Kentucky Nat'l Park Com. v. Dennison, 281 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 61</cite>, 134 S.W.2d 973, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 9</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a covenant of warranty in a deed is broken, it immediately becomes a chose in action in favor of the grantee in the deed, and the right to sue the original grantor for breach of the covenant does not pass to subsequent grantees in the absence of an express assignment. Howard v. Montgomery, 293 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 291</cite>, 168 S.W.2d 991, 1943 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 604</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The existence of a private right of way across land conveyed by warranty deed is a breach of the covenant of general warranty, and the grantee’s knowledge of the right of way affords no protection to the grantor from his covenant. Whitley Lodge of Knights of Pythias v. West, 293 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 341</cite>, 168 S.W.2d 1009, 1943 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 613</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        An action cannot be maintained by a vendee of land upon warranty of title until he is either evicted or his title is adjudged inferior in a suit to recover the land. Pendleton v. Centre College of Kentucky, 818 S.W.2d 616, 1991 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 122</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Covenant of title in deed to land, to which grantor did not have title and to which he did not and could not deliver possession, was breached when the conveyance was made and cause of action accrued at once.
    Butt v. Riffe, 78 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 352</cite>, 1880 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 19</cite> (Ky. 1880).
       </p>
       <p>
        To enable a vendee to recover for breach of general warranty of title, he had to allege and prove that he had been evicted.
    Jones v. Jones, 87 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 82</cite>, 7 S.W. 886, 9 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 942</cite>, 1888 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 47</cite> (Ky. 1888).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The fact that grantor in deed excepted a portion of the conveyed property from the warranty clause did not constitute an admission that grantor did not claim title to such portion. Conyers' Adm'x v. McGee, 294 <cite class="ocky"></cite>, 171 S.W.2d 450, 1943 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 436</cite> (Ky. 1943).

       <p>
        Grantee may waive his right to rely upon a covenant inserted in a deed for his protection. Whitley Lodge of Knights of Pythias v. West, 293 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 341</cite>, 168 S.W.2d 1009, 1943 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 613</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>

        Where grantees discovered existence of right of way before delivery of deed, and at first refused to accept deed because of right of way, but later decided to accept deed after grantor had told them that the only alternative was to call the deal off, there was at least a jury question as to whether grantees had waived their right to rely on the covenant of general warranty.

       <p>
        A conveyance to a railroad specifically for a right of way conveys only an easement, and the fact that the deed contains a warranty or designates the conveyed interest as a fee is not controlling. Sherman v. Petroleum Exploration, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 105</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 768, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 86</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        A deed must be interpreted as a whole and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made; and, in construing an indefinite and ambiguous conveyance of property specifically for a railroad right of way, the court will consider the fact that much railroad right of way is expressly or by operation of law limited to an easement, which is usually sufficient for the use intended. Sherman v. Petroleum Exploration, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 105</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 768, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 86</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        Grantor conveyed a narrow strip of land, described by reference to a surveyed line on which railroad tracks were to be laid, “unto the party of the second part and its successors and assigns
    . . . . .
    for railroad right of way
    . . . . .
    to have and to hold
    . . . . .
    unto the party of the second part and its successors and assigns forever, with covenant of general warranty of title.” Held, the deed conveyed an easement for railroad purposes, and not a fee, and the easement reverted to the grantor when the strip was abandoned. Sherman v. Petroleum Exploration, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 105</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 768, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 86</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        In a deed conveying a railroad right of way, the phrase “for railroad right of way” cannot be rejected as surplusage for it is presumed that no clause or word in a deed is used without meaning or intent, the words quoted are a declaration of purpose.

        A vendor’s lien is never implied against warranties in any case where the circumstances show that the existence of such a lien could not have been intended, and would be in antagonism to the manifest intention to clear the title of such impediments.

        As between the parties, grantor would have a lien for the purchase money under the provisions of this section where there was no fraud on part of grantor and the purchaser could not retain the title to the property without being liable to the grantor for the purchase price even though he did not sign the notes nor sign or acknowledge the mortgage. Starbird v. Blair, 227 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 258</cite>, 12 S.W.2d 693, 1928 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 501</cite> (Ky. 1928).

        This section does not apply between parties to deed and grantor has lien for all unpaid purchase money as between parties to the deed whether unpaid purchase money be stated in the deed or not. Uppington v. Cooper, 279 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 305</cite>, 130 S.W.2d 733, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 265</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        Although there was no reservation of a lien between the parties under this section, there was a lien between the parties for payment of purchase money notes and personal representative of grantor should have attempted to collect the notes.

        The vendor’s lien is a creature of equity and rests upon the principle that one who gets the estate of another ought not in conscience be allowed to keep it without paying the consideration.

       The proper manner of recording an instrument assigning various oil and gas leasehold interests would be the spreading of the entire document, including the exhibits, upon the record. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 72-152</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be enforceable and to be good against a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, deed restrictions must be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county court of the county in which a greater part of the land lies. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 73-115</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While this section does not expressly provide for the indicating of the immediate source of title, it would appear that for the sake of properly identifying the land in coal mining leases and in giving constructive notice to third parties, the showing of the immediate source of title is implicit in this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-32</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A coal lease for five (5) years or less would be recordable if it contains the entire agreement and is properly executed as required by law. A coal lease in excess of five (5) years requires recordation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-296</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section, standing alone, may contain some suggestion that a coal lease of five (5) years or less may not require recordation, and unrecorded might prevail against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, such construction is not in conformity with the Kentucky law (including <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.100" target="_self">KRS 382.100</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.270" target="_self">382.270)</a></cite> as interpreted by the courts. A coal lease of five years or less, to be good against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, must be properly recorded in the county clerk’s office. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-296</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The explicit language of this section envisions the recording of the entire contents of the lease, subject to proper signatures and execution pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.130" target="_self">KRS 382.130</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-296</cite>.

        Where vendor did not reserve to himself as against subsequent vendees any lien upon or right to or easement in the property he is conveying, he may protect himself against subsequent vendees, notwithstanding the omission from his deed, by recording the contract of sale before his vendee has parted with title and possession.

        The recording of a title bond imparts to it no more legal force, except as serving notice to creditors and purchasers, than if it were not recorded. Burkhart v.

        Since recording of title bond was notice that purchase money had been paid, title was acquired as against vendor by third person who purchased property from vendee, without notice and in good faith, pending suit by vendor to enforce lien for unpaid price but where vendor had failed to file notice of lis pendens as required.

        Prior to the enactment of this section bonds for title to land and other contracts with reference to interests therein were not authorized by law to be acknowledged and proved as deeds, and could not be recorded, and hence could not impart notice to subsequent purchasers.

        A title bond was lodged for record before deed and grantee in deed took with constructive notice of rights under the title bond where deed was presented to deputy clerk who told grantee and his attorney the deed could not be lodged for record until it contained revenue stamps and while they went out to get the stamps the title bond was lodged for record.

        Where execution was levied on debtor’s land and lis pendens notice filed by a judgment creditor without actual notice of contract of sale and deed by debtor to a third party and prior to recording by third party, the judgment creditor had a lien on the land against third party grantee, the land could be sold to satisfy the judgment creditor’s lien although before adoption of this section, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.270" target="_self">KRS 382.270</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.450" target="_self">382.450,</a></cite> which must all be read together, if the judgment creditor had notice before the sale under the execution he had no preference.

       <p>
        Certain deed did not conform to the requirements of this section as to derivation of title to grantor, and should not have been recorded by clerk. Fordson Coal Co. v. Wells, 245 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 291</cite>, 53 S.W.2d 564, 1932 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 591</cite> (Ky. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where deed recites that described land is the same as that conveyed by a previous deed in grantor’s chain of title, the deed will be treated as conveying all of the land described in the previous deed, even though the description in the instant deed covers a smaller boundary than that in the previous deed. Elliott v. Green, 294 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 660</cite>, 172 S.W.2d 442, 1943 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 504</cite> (Ky. 1943).

        A deed tendered by vendor under accepted proposition of sale containing a reference to deed book and page in which conveyance to vendor was recorded could have been recorded under this section and was sufficient tender of deed.

Cain v. Gray, 146 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 402</cite>, 142 S.W. 715, 1912 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 81</cite> (Ky. 1912).

        Where record of deed in clerk’s office did not show signature or acknowledgment by one of persons named as grantors, testimony of witness that in case in federal court he heard brother of such person testify that he saw such person sign and acknowledge deed was not competent, and therefore could not overcome record.

        The general rule is that the lodging of a deed for record in the proper office by the grantor is sufficient to constitute a delivery. Nunn v. Justice, 278 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 811</cite>, 129 S.W.2d 564, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 500</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        Where grantees were present when deeds were drawn and lodged of record by grantors and took part in the transaction, the lodging of record undoubtedly constituted valid delivery of the deeds.

        Where deed, in which corporation was named as grantee was found, after the death of an officer of the corporation who had charge of the papers and deeds of the corporation, among the papers of such officer, the presumption thereby arising, that the deed had been delivered to the corporation was not overcome by the fact that the deed had not been recorded.

        Circuit Court did not clearly err in determining that the first of two (2) banks did not have a valid legal mortgage and/or a valid equitable mortgage on the subject property, as that bank’s debtor was not the true owner of the property, and thus, lacked the power to mortgage it; hence, the first bank acquired no power to assert a lien on the property and could not claim that the second bank was depriving it of money or benefits.

        Because the plain language of the mortgage contract did not grant the lender a lien on debtor’s manufactured home as personal property, the lender did not obtain a security interest in the manufactured home through the mortgage contract, and even if the lender had obtained a lien against the manufactured home by way of the mortgage contract, it was undisputed that the lender did not note the security interest on the certificate of title, and the filing of a lis pendens could not serve to perfect a security interest in a manufactured home; accordingly, before the state-court foreclosure judgment, the lender did not have a perfected lien on debtor’s manufactured home.

       Where a deed contains land conveyed under one (1) boundary as contiguous property, then subsection (1) of this section requires the deed to be recorded in the county in which a greater portion of the one contiguous tract lies; if the deed, or other instrument required to be recorded, involves two (2) or more tracts which are not contiguous, then, as to a particular tract of the instrument, the instrument must be recorded in the county in which a greater portion of the particular tract of land lies. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-294</cite>.

       Where A owns Blackacre and wishes to convey it to B by a general warranty deed, which contains as a description only the date and recording information as to deed book, deed page and county of the deed by which A took title to Blackacre, such a description is sufficient under this section to require the clerk to record the deed from A to B, since reference is made in the general warranty deed to the immediate source of title, which source fully describes the land, and, taken together, they yield the information necessary for the clerk to record the deed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-100</cite>.

       An unrecorded deed, if otherwise validly executed, delivered and accepted, is good against the grantor and his heirs; however, the deed is not valid as to a creditor or other purchaser without actual notice of the transaction. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-276</cite>.

       Where a county clerk located a number of duly executed and acknowledged deeds that were delivered to the clerk’s office some 20 to 30 years ago for recordation, but the deeds were in fact never recorded, the deeds were correct in form and remained recordable; accordingly, the county clerk should record such instruments, unless beforehand he received an order of a court of law or the fiscal court not to record. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-276</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county clerk has no authority to fill in and complete blanks left in deeds, mortgages, etc., which are filed for recording. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-496</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1) of this section was designed to cover only contiguous land in a single tract or boundary; thus, where a deed contains noncontiguous property and more than one (1) boundary of land lying in two (2) or more counties, such deed, to give constructive notice as to all land in the deed, must be recorded in the respective counties in which each parcel is located. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-48</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the land description of purchased property in reality embraced one (1) boundary, but involved a land strip contiguously extending through four (4) counties, the deed was properly recorded in the county in which the greater part of the land conveyed lay; the correct recording in the county containing the greater land area provided constructive notice as to all of the land described in the deed and no additional recording in the other three (3) counties was necessary or legally required. Thus, the clerks in the other three (3) counties could and should have legally refused to record such deed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-48</cite>.

        This section, which merely sets out the steps an intestate heir must take to enable him to file a deed and convey his interest, does not invest the required affidavit of descent with the effect of a warranty of title. Sirls v. Jordan, 625 S.W.2d 106, 1981 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 301</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1981).

       <p>
        Although the contents of the affidavit of descent required by this section provides the potential purchaser of real property with notice of the source of title claimed by the grantor, this section does not raise the affidavit to the level of conclusive proof of heirship. Sirls v. Jordan, 625 S.W.2d 106, 1981 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 301</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature anticipated the risk of fraud inherent in the affidavit of descent required by this section because it supplied a statutory cause of action in subsection (2) of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.990" target="_self">KRS 382.990</a></cite> for an injured party against a person who knowingly makes a false statement in an affidavit of descent.

       A clerk must record an otherwise properly executed deed which sets out as its source of title an affidavit of descent as is provided in the statute. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 61-986</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deeds and related affidavits of descent should be lodged for record and recorded and indexed as separate instruments. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 68-531</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Acts 1966, chapter 210, is constitutional, it repealed this section by implication as applied to Campbell County so that the courthouse district commissioners have no responsibility in connection with the subject index work. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 72-176</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section mandatorily requires the filing of the affidavit of descent prior to or contemporaneously with the recording of the deed in question. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 72-439</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any deed subsequent to one which cannot be recorded due to a lack of affidavit involves an inheritance, then such deed is recordable if it meets the requirements of this section but if any such deed involves a deed of transfer, then it would not be recordable. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 72-439</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Affidavits of descent need not include a statement of the fair market value of the property transferred by intestacy. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-165</cite>.

       Under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.135" target="_self">KRS 382.135</a></cite>, the personal representative of an estate is required to file an affidavit setting forth the value of the interests, but affidavits of descent, under this section, need not contain a statement of value. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-165</cite>.

        Where clerk’s certificate showed deed was acknowledged by subscribing witnesses but not by grantor, the execution of the deed was not properly proven, and the clerk was not authorized to record it and a copy of it was not admissible as evidence.

        A deed, duly signed and delivered by grantor and accepted by grantee, although not acknowledged, was valid as between parties, and those claiming under them, but was not recordable. Travis v.

        An acknowledgment within the legislative meaning of that word as employed in the act, is a form of declaration or admission before an authorized public officer by a person who has executed an instrument, that such instrument is his act and deed. Billington v. Dunn, 217 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 164</cite>, 289 S.W. 213, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 40</cite> (Ky. 1926).

        Contract in form of a deed with a lien retained for payment of purchase price, but without a certificate of acknowledgment, had force and effect of a deed as between vendor and vendee and operated to pass the title to vendor.

The presumption is in favor of the officer’s act, and the burden is upon the parties asserting fraud or mistake to establish it, not merely by a preponderance of the evidence, but by clear and convincing evidence such as to leave no doubt.

        Although a deed may have been defectively acknowledged yet it was good between the parties and passed title from grantor to grantee, for as a general rule an unacknowledged deed passes title between the parties and those claiming under them although it is not a recordable instrument.

        The burden is on one contesting validity of a recorded instrument to prove facts relied on as a basis of contest since courts generally have construed the record, when they were acknowledged with a valid certificate, or other statutory evidence of their due execution as furnishing strong presumptive evidence of this execution.

        <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.135" target="_self">KRS 382.135</a></cite> does not contravene the common law regarding the validity of any deed. As between the grantor and grantee, and third parties with notice, even a complete failure to include the consideration certificate called for in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.135" target="_self">KRS 382.135</a></cite> will not affect the validity of a deed if that deed contains the fundamental elements necessary to a valid and enforceable deed. The deed will remain unrecordable, however, until it substantially complies with <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.135" target="_self">KRS 382.135</a></cite>. Smith v.

        While <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.135" target="_self">KRS 382.135</a></cite> requires a certificate of consideration on a deed, it does not contravene Kentucky common law regarding deeds. The common law in Kentucky regarding deeds provides that it is fundamentally necessary that a conveyance identify the grantor or grantors in the body of the instrument in order to pass valid title. Branham v. Estate of Elkins, 425 S.W.3d 103, 2014 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 17</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).

        2. Enforceable Deed.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A deed was valid and enforceable between the parties since the deed identified the grantor and the grantees, the parties admitted that the property was transferred into three equal shares, with right of survivorship, between the father, the daughter, and the husband, the husband accepted the deed, and the lodging of the deed for record in the proper office by the grantor was sufficient to constitute a delivery; it was irrelevant whether the deed was recordable under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.135" target="_self">KRS 382.135</a></cite>. Smith v. Vest, 265 S.W.3d 246, 2007 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 466</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The deed in question is a valid deed if it contains the fundamental elements necessary to a valid and enforceable deed, which are: (1) a grantor and grantee; (2) delivery and acceptance; (3) a divesting of title by grantor and a vesting of title in the grantee. If each of these elements is present, the deed’s recordability in this case is irrelevant. Smith v. Vest, 265 S.W.3d 246, 2007 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 466</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).

        County clerk properly permitted the filing of a deed where it substantially complied with <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.135" target="_self">KRS 382.135</a></cite>; the mailing addresses were clearly stated in the deed, the consideration of the parties’
    mutual desire that they effect ownership of the property jointly with rights of survivorship was sufficient, the parties substantially complied with <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.135" target="_self">KRS 382.135</a></cite>(1)(d) even though the certificate of consideration did not state that it was a gift, and the deed did not have to be signed by the grantee.

        Appellants argued that the sale of property to a company was contingent on their receipt of the proceeds from easements, but the court disagreed because, in part, appellants affirmed that the total consideration for the property was $250,000, and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.135" target="_self">KRS 382.135</a></cite> requires all deeds to contain a statement of the full consideration paid or a statement of the fair cash value of the property; the court would violate the spirit of the statute if the court rewarded appellants for under-reporting the consideration they believed they were due by almost $300,000.00.

       If the legislature intended by subsection (1)(d) of this section to require a statement of the estimated fair cash value of property being transferred only in the case of a transfer by gift, and that such requirement did not apply to a transfer with nominal or no consideration, it would have been unnecessary to make reference to a transfer with nominal or no consideration; the clear purpose of subsection (1)(d), as indicated by its express terms, is to address both a transfer by gift and a transfer with nominal or no consideration. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 96-21</cite>.

        A notary’s certificate of acknowledgment upon a deed purports absolute verity unless attacked in the manner provided in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.060" target="_blank">KRS 61.060</a></cite>. The presumption is in favor of the officer’s act, and the burden is upon the parties asserting fraud or mistake to establish it, not merely by a preponderance of the evidence, but by clear and convincing evidence such as to leave no doubt. Turner v. Howard, 277 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 172</cite>, 126 S.W.2d 135, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 635</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        Where notary testified that defendant did sign and acknowledge deed, and he was not impeached, denial by defendant supported only to a limited extent by corroborating circumstances was not sufficient to prove forgery. Turner v. Howard, 277 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 172</cite>, 126 S.W.2d 135, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 635</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        Certificate of notary public that mortgage was signed and acknowledged before him imported verity to the instrument. Catron v. Jones, 281 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 163</cite>, 135 S.W.2d 419, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 27</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        This section required the county clerk to keep and maintain a general alphabetical cross-index of all instruments therein referred to and not an alphabetical cross-index for each book.

       <p>
        It was the duty of the clerk to keep a current general alphabetical index but no duty devolved upon a county clerk or his deputy to go back prior to his present term of office and make up a general index which should have been but was not kept up currently. Land v. Lewis, 299 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 866</cite>, 186 S.W.2d 803, 1945 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 496</cite> (Ky. 1945).

        Although the clerk failed to index deed, and grantee withdrew his deed without seeing that the proper index had been made the record of the deed was notice to subsequent purchasers.

        A county clerk could not recover from the county for preparing vowel indexes of deed books, mortgage books, and marriage bonds, unless the record of the fiscal court showed either authorization for the work or an agreement to accept and pay.

     General cross indexes — Adoption and maintenance.
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="tXXXIIc382s382.205ol11">
       Any county where indexes to the records of deeds, mortgages, wills, marriages, or other public records have been or may hereafter be prepared by the Work Projects Administration or other appropriate agency of the United States government, or by order of the fiscal court of any county, such indexes or any of them may be adopted as the official general cross indexes of such records in the manner provided by this section in addition to each individual book index. Upon the completion of any such indexing project by an appropriate federal agency or by a person or persons acting under the authority of a fiscal court, or at any time thereafter, any citizen of the county may petition the county judge/executive to have said index adopted as the official index. Upon the filing of the petition, the county judge/executive may forthwith by appropriate order designate a licensed attorney practicing in the county who with the county attorney and county clerk shall comprise a commission to examine the index proposed to be adopted and ascertain whether the index is a complete and accurate index of the records to which it pertains. The commission shall thereupon make such examination as may be necessary to ascertain to its satisfaction whether such index is complete and accurate. Upon completion of such examination, the commission shall make a written report to the county judge/executive of the results thereof and of its recommendations, which report shall lie over for exceptions for sixty (60) days. Notice of the filing of said report shall be given by the clerk by publication pursuant to KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.38.html#tXXXVIIIc424" target="_blank">Chapter 424</a></cite>. Exceptions may be filed by any interested person, and if filed shall be heard and determined as in other cases. If no exceptions are filed thereto, or upon the exceptions (if any) the county judge/executive shall hear such proof as may be thought proper respecting the report filed by the clerk and the exceptions, and shall determine whether the said index is complete and accurate, and if it is determined that the index is complete and accurate, an order shall be entered adopting said index; provided, that if from such report or such proof it appears that corrections or additions should be made to such index in order to render it accurate and complete, the order may direct that such corrections or additions shall be made by the clerk, and in that event it shall be the duty of the clerk to make such corrections or additions forthwith, and upon his report that he has done so an order shall be entered adopting the index as so corrected. If adopted, said index shall thereupon become the official general cross index of the records to which it pertains, and all persons shall be entitled to rely thereon to the same extent as if the index had been prepared by the county clerk. Upon the adoption of any such index, it shall be the duty of the clerk to bring same up to date from the point at which same ceased to be made by the agency which prepared it, and to continue and maintain said index thereafter in lieu of the indexing system theretofore used, except he will continue to keep the regular individual book index, and to index all instruments lodged for record in conformity therewith. The indexes theretofore used shall not be destroyed after the adoption of the new indexes, but shall be safely kept by the clerk as other records are kept, subject to inspection by any person interested therein.

       A clerk may refuse to record a deed, affidavit of descent or any other instrument relating to real property where the tendered instrument is not accompanied by the proper recording fee; however, the clerk may not refuse to record a tendered instrument merely because it does not bear the proper group indexing number under this section; if the clerk refused to record an instrument because it wasn’t accompanied by the proper fee, the clerk would not be liable if in the interim another party filed an instrument which, because it was first recorded, gave that party a superior lien; if, on the other hand, the clerk’s refusal to record arises from the fact that the instrument does not bear the proper group index number, the injured party may have a cause of action against the clerk for damages sustained. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-464</cite>.

        The object of this section was to protect subsequent purchasers and creditors and it is immaterial whether the deed was made by a prior holder of the title or to enforce a statutory lien through judicial proceeding.

        It is policy of law that title to real property should be made matter of record and bona fide purchasers are not bound by a matter not of record, unless they have notice of such facts as would put a reasonable man on notice. Terry v. Ellsworth, 236 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 54</cite>, 32 S.W.2d 558, 1930 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 682</cite> (Ky. 1930).

        It is only where the rights of innocent purchasers or creditors within the meaning of this section are involved that recordation becomes a factor. Bratcher v. Ashley, 243 S.W.2d 1011, 1951 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1197</cite> (Ky. 1951).

        This section is not a matter of “pure race” to recordation but rather “race-notice”; it is not the first to record, but the first to record without notice, who achieves superiority. Minix v.

        Recording statutes do not include street improvement liens; purchaser of property is chargeable with notice of ordinance and proceedings of city council by which improvement lien is created.

        This section did not apply where record owners of real estate held by them and an undisclosed joint owner had been sold and creditor of record owners sued them on promissory notes and undertook to attach funds in the hands of the purchaser of the real estate as garnishee, all of which funds belonged to the undisclosed joint owner as the record owners had already received their share, and the unrecorded joint owner’s claim to the money was superior to the record owner’s attachment creditor since the attachment creditor acquired no greater rights than his debtors, the record owners, had at the time of the attachment order, which were none. Amick v. Goodykoontz, 241 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 315</cite>, 43 S.W.2d 1000, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 72</cite> (Ky. 1931).

        This section applies to creditors becoming such subsequent to conveyance and antecedent creditors who, at some time prior to recording, had secured some equity in the property. A creditor on a note, executed before conveyance and renewed after conveyance but before recording was not a “subsequent creditor” entitled to set aside conveyance, since renewal did not change the status of the debt but only the evidence thereof. First Nat'l Bank v. Williamson, 273 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 116</cite>, 115 S.W.2d 565, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 586</cite> (Ky. 1938).

        The statutes which require recording of mortgages and deeds of real and personal property do not embrace choses in action or claims for debt and an unrecorded assignment of an indemnity agreement between highway contractor and surety on its bond to state highway department of all the contractor’s rights created an equitable lien superior to a subsequent attachment lien by contractor’s judgment creditors. National Surety Corp. v. Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins. Co., 280 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 785</cite>, 134 S.W.2d 611, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Where a recorded mortgage did not have a valid acknowledgment pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.270" target="_self">KRS 382.270</a></cite>, the mortgage was treated as if it had never been recorded. Because the defective mortgage was treated as though it was never recorded, the assignment of the mortgage to the creditor was outside the chain of title, and the mortgage was avoided pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(a)(3).

        Where a mortgage was not properly acknowledged in that the notary was not present to certify that the debtors appeared before her when they signed the mortgage, the defective mortgage was not saved by the 2006 amendment to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.270" target="_self">KRS 382.270</a></cite>.

        It was not error for a bankruptcy court to find that an acknowledgement on a creditor’s mortgage document was defective and that the mortgage could be avoided by a trustee pursuant to 11 USCS § 544 because the acknowledgement did not comply with the requirements of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.38.html#tXXXVIIIc423s423.130" target="_blank">KRS 423.130</a></cite> that were in effect at the time when the notary paragraph stated only “acknowledged before me” and did not state the names of the signors or the date signed.

        The words “without notice” in this section apply to creditors as well as purchasers for a valuable consideration, and the possession of the grantee in unrecorded deed was sufficient notice. Stone v. Keith, 218 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 11</cite>, 290 S.W. 1042, 1927 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 92</cite> (Ky. 1927). See Sears v.

        Where possession of son to real estate conveyed to him by deed from his father was actual, open and unequivocal, it was such as to put all persons dealing with the title on inquiry and was notice of whatever title the son claimed although the deed was never recorded and was destroyed by the father after the son returned the deed to the father with instructions to record it. Powell's Trustee in Bankruptcy v. Powell, 232 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 27</cite>, 22 S.W.2d 293, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 383</cite> (Ky. 1929).

        In an action by purchasers to enjoin delivery of sheriff’s deed and to set aside levy and sale thereunder, the burden was on the execution creditor to allege and prove that at the time he acquired his lien he had no notice of the prior unrecorded conveyance of the real estate where purchasers were in possession.

       <p>
        Where property is sold by unrecorded deed and possession is taken by purchaser and maintained thereafter it operates as notice to creditors and purchasers, but where record title holder continues to reside in the property with the purchaser the latter’s possession is not inconsistent with title in former and does not constitute notice.

        Where, at time deed was executed and delivered, grantee was occupying and living upon a tract of land adjoining the tract conveyed by the deed, the delivery of the deed had the effect of placing the grantee in constructive, actual possession of the conveyed tract, and of constituting sufficient notice to put subsequent purchasers on inquiry, even though the deed was not put to record.

        Where grantee legally lodged deed which contained all the required entries and certificates for record and the clerk recorded only the body and signature but not the certificate of acknowledgment and made a memorandum on the deed that it had been recorded, grantee when she took it from the office had the evidence of it having been recorded and was not required to look at the record books to ascertain whether it had been recorded, but could assume that it had and it was constructive notice and binding on subsequent purchasers.

        A county clerk’s failure to keep the required alphabetical index for indexing deeds delivered to him for recording may make him liable to anyone who may be damaged thereby, but it does not defeat the effect of the delivery of a deed for record as constructive notice to all persons after that time.

Therefore the bankruptcy court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel correctly concluded that the mortgage did not provide constructive notice under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.270" target="_self">KRS 382.270</a></cite> to subsequent purchasers or creditors because it was not properly acknowledged under Kentucky law and was consequently subject to avoidance by the trustee pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 544, and that it should have been preserved for the benefit of the estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 551; accordingly, the court affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court granting summary judgment to the trustee.

       The statement in subsection (1) of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc355s355.9-313" target="_blank">KRS 355.9-313</a></cite> that KRS chapter 355 does not prevent the creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures or real estate pursuant to the Kentucky law which is applicable to real estate, attests to a legislative intent that the real estate mortgage or lien concept and the existing statutory formalities of this section and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.330" target="_self">KRS 382.330</a></cite> remain inviolate and unchanged. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-144</cite>.

       A coal lease for five years or less would be recordable if it contains the entire agreement and is properly executed as required by law. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-296</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.080" target="_self">KRS 382.080</a></cite>, standing alone, may contain some suggestion that a coal lease of five years or less may not require recordation, and unrecorded might prevail against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, such construction is not in conformity with the Kentucky law (including <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.100" target="_self">KRS 382.100</a></cite> and this section) as interpreted by the courts. A coal lease of five years or less, to be good against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, must be properly recorded in the county clerk’s office. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-296</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute of frauds, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.30.html#tXXXc371s371.010" target="_blank">KRS 371.010</a></cite>, has no relation to the system of constructive notice established pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.100" target="_self">KRS 382.100</a></cite> and this section. Therefore, the recording of a memorandum of a coal lease will not suffice to be effective against bona fide purchasers for value without notice. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-296</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An unrecorded deed, if otherwise validly executed, delivered and accepted, is good against the grantor and his heirs; however, the deed is not valid as to a creditor or other purchaser without actual notice of the transaction. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-276</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An unrecorded deed would be valid and would prevail over a subsequent deed where the subsequent grantee knew or had notice of the unrecorded deed prior to the subsequent grantee’s purchase, or had information sufficient to put him on inquiry that would have led to its discovery, such information being equivalent to notice. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-276</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a subsequent grantee or creditor has no actual knowledge or notice of such prior deed or has no information sufficient to put the subsequent grantee on inquiry that would lead to the discovery of the prior deed upon a search, the prior and unrecorded deed would not be valid against such creditor or subsequent grantee. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-276</cite>.

        A second mortgagee with notice, actual or constructive, does not have priority over a first mortgagee by recording his mortgage first. Flowers v. Moorman &amp; Hill, 86 S.W. 545, 27 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 728</cite> (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        A recorded mortgage is superior to a prior unrecorded mortgage, if it was a recordable instrument and the debt was created and the mortgage accepted without notice of the prior mortgage. City Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Planters' Bank &amp; Trust Co., 176 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 500</cite>, 195 S.W. 1124, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 87</cite> (Ky. 1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision in mortgage that lien therein created should be superior to all others could not affect prior recorded mortgage. Avey v. Via, 225 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 155</cite>, 7 S.W.2d 1057, 1928 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 739</cite> (Ky. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any taxes by a city or by a county assessed against particular real estate which was sold pursuant to foreclosure would have a priority over a recorded mortgage. Midland-Guardian Co. v. McElroy, 563 S.W.2d 752, 1978 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 490</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).

       <p>
        Since <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.270" target="_self">KRS 382.270</a></cite>, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.280" target="_self">KRS 382.280</a></cite> and Kentucky case law do not address the specific situation of the judgment lien in this case, the rationale in the Restatement (Third) of Property should control: third parties who lend money used to purchase real estate in exchange for a mortgage hold special priority over all other recorded liens and judgments except where agreed otherwise by the parties or specified by statute. Ky. Legal Sys. Corp. v. Dunn, 205 S.W.3d 235, 2006 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 111</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a judgment lienholder recorded its lien before another mortgage was created on the property and later assigned, the judgment lien had priority under the recording statute, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.280" target="_self">KRS 382.280</a></cite>. The doctrine of equitable subrogation did not apply, because an adequate title search would have prevented the assignee’s potential loss. Roberts v. Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., 2009 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 209</cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2009 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1096 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 30, 2009).

        Pursuant to the plain terms of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.280" target="_self">KRS 382.280</a></cite>, appellee bank held the prior and superior lien in residential real property owned in fee simple where it was undisputed that the bank’s lien upon the property constituted the first in time recorded lien and that appellant was unaware of the bank’s prior recorded lien due to an error by its title examiner. The equities of the case did not favor application of equitable subrogation. W.M. Specialty Mortg., LLC v. Cmty. Trust Bank, Inc., 2011 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 33</cite> (Ky. Ct.

        Deed must be deemed to have been recorded on the day it was lodged for record, notwithstanding the full certificate of record bears date 18 days later. Virginia Iron, Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Webb, 263 F. 821, 1920 U.S. App. LEXIS 2096 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1920</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule is that the lodging of a deed for record in the proper office is sufficient to constitute a delivery. Nunn v. Justice, 278 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 811</cite>, 129 S.W.2d 564, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 500</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        Where daughters, grantees in deeds from their parents, were present when deeds were drawn and lodged for record, and took part in the transaction, under the circumstances the lodging for record undoubtedly constituted a valid delivery of deeds. Nunn v. Justice, 278 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 811</cite>, 129 S.W.2d 564, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 500</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        Where fact of transfer of note was not noted on margin of deed book as required by this section, children of maker of note receiving as creditors and not as heirs of father’s estate were not bound by father’s knowledge of claim against him based on note and creditor holding the transferred note could not compel contribution after settlement of estate although she had no actual notice of the settlement.

        The assignment of a note given as part of the purchase price of land carries with it the vendor’s lien in the deed retained to the extent of the note so assigned. Hicks' Committee v.

        Where assignee of note secured by lien on land failed to cause the change in ownership to appear upon deed records and permitted the maker to retain possession of original liens upon their being renewed, and the maker obtained from another a loan secured by mortgage upon the land in question, the latter lien of mortgage was superior to that of owner of purchase money lien.

        Where purchaser of land gave three purchase money notes, one of which was sold and assigned but assignment not noted on record as required by this section, and where land was later sold in foreclosure proceedings on mortgage assumed by purchaser, but assignee of note was not made a party, and land was sold to original owner and assignor of note who then gave new mortgage to bank having no notice of assignment of the purchase money note, the bank occupied a better position than the assignee of the note whose losses were solely attributable to his own negligence in failing to have his lien assigned of record since the lien securing the three notes was extinguished by the judgment of sale and execution of the commissioner’s deed as effectively as if released in the margin of the recorded deed.

      A recorded mortgage may be amended by an affidavit of amendment prepared by an attorney to correct clerical errors or omitted information. An affidavit of amendment may not change any term, dollar amount, or interest rate in the mortgage, unless signed by the mortgagor and secured party. An affidavit of amendment may not change the parties or the collateral of a recorded mortgage, but may be used to correct a manifest clerical or typographical error such as spelling, punctuation, or numbering mistakes in typing or printing. The attorney preparing the affidavit shall certify in the affidavit that notice of filing the amendment has been given to the mortgagor by mailing a copy of the amendment to the mortgagor at the address shown on the original mortgage.

       This section imposes, as a condition for the clerk’s recording of a deed, the requirement that the grantor’s signature be acknowledged or proved before him as required by law; the signature of the grantor must be acknowledged or proven, under one of the five (5) alternatives as specifically outlined in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.130" target="_self">KRS 382.130</a></cite>, if the deed is to be recordable.

        Where a mortgage instrument that was recorded recited no maturity date, but was in perfectly recordable form in all other particulars, the mortgage was sufficiently perfected, despite its technical deficiency, to defeat a claim against the real estate by a bankruptcy trustee.

Accordingly, although a maturity date could have been determined by reference to extrinsic evidence, the mortgage nonetheless failed to comply with <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.330" target="_self">KRS 382.330</a></cite> and was subject to avoidance under 11 U.S.C.S. § 544.

        Trustee’s complaint, which sought to avoid the creditors’ lien on the real property as unperfected against the trustee as a hypothetical bona fide purchaser and/or a hypothetical judicial lien creditor, was dismissed with prejudice where the deed was sufficient to defeat the claim of the trustee because the deed complied with Kentucky law regarding acknowledgement and it gave adequate notice of the creditors’ lien because (1) the deed was clearly titled “General Warranty Deed with Lien” and stated that the consideration was secured by a promissory note, (2) set out in a separate paragraph was the statement that a lien was retained to secure the unpaid purchase price, (3) although the amount of indebtedness shown was incorrect, it was less than the actual amount of indebtedness, which by common sense was the amount secured, and (4) although the final maturity date shown was incorrect, it was off by one (1) payment, one (1) month.

        The zoning ordinances assisted the county clerk and the Property Valuation Administrator (PVA) in properly performing their statutorily required duties, including the county clerk’s duty to record lawful deeds under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.110" target="_self">KRS 382.110</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.335" target="_self">KRS 382.335</a></cite>, and the PVA’s duty to maintain lists of all real property additions to the property tax rolls for the county under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132s132.015" target="_blank">KRS 132.015</a></cite>.

      <p>
       The drafting of instruments such as those described in this section constitutes the practice of law, but if such document is presented and is signed by a person who is not a lawyer, it must be accepted for recording. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-515</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deeds of release of liens on real estate are included in the coverage of this section and must bear the signature of the author. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-629</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The test of whether the instrument must contain a statement concerning authorship is: Does the instrument convey, grant, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of an interest in real or personal property, and does the law require that the instrument be recorded? <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-630</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Financing statements need not bear the signed statement showing who prepared the instrument. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-631</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statement does not have to be certified but must merely show the name and address of the individual who prepared it and his signature. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-647</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the person who prepared the instrument has the statement of authorship with his address and signature on it, the clerk must record the instrument. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-700</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not the clerk’s duty to determine whether the person who prepared the instrument is an attorney and to refuse to record the instrument if that person is not. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-700</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any instrument which conveys, grants, encumbers, assigns or otherwise disposes of an interest in real estate or personal property comes within the provisions of this section and such would include deeds, mortgages, a release of lien or deed or release, wills, bills of sale. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-714</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The absence of the required certification could make the instrument defective as a properly recorded one. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-714</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not include automobile bills of sale. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-714</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not include financing statements required to be filed under the Uniform Commercial Code. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-714</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a copy of the chattel instrument is filed instead of a financing statement, it shall be considered as a financing statement if it meets all the requirements of a financing statement and need not contain the statement of authorship required by this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-787</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Affidavits of descent require the authorship statement provided for in this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-958</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Final settlement papers do not require the statement of authorship. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-958</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A deed prepared by a master commissioner following a judicial sale must bear the statement of authorship before the county court clerk shall record it. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-985</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A power of attorney is not required to bear the signed statement of authorship. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 62-1100</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not impose on the county clerk a responsibility to determine that an instrument presented for recordation was prepared by a licensed attorney. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 68-400</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person having a lien on personalty that is to become a fixture wishes to do so he may record it as a real estate mortgage if it meets the requirements of a mortgage, but it is not necessary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 68-407</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A notary public would be considered to be the person who prepared a deed within the meaning of this section when he copied the form of the prior deed and completed a new instrument by changing the names of the parties and the dates. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 69-280</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law contemplates a mailing address ordinarily used by such grantee. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 70-539</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “mailing address” means an address that is deemed to be sufficient for mail delivery purposes. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 70-539</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mailing address requirement mentioned in subsection (2) of this section applies to oil and gas leases executed or acknowledged on July 1, 1970 or thereafter, because an oil lease involves a conveyance of real property. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-198</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       For documents that are required to show the identity of the draftsman, the mere signing of such instrument by an attorney or party to the instrument that “I have seen and approved” would not be sufficient compliance with the law. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-445</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the express wording of the law, the actual draftsman (the person who prepared the instrument) must by a printed, typewritten or stamped statement show the name and address of the draftsman and the draftsman must sign his name to such statement. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-445</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The principal types of instruments covered by this section include deeds, releases of liens or deeds of release, mortgages, leases, assignments of leasehold interests, contracts for sale of land, options to sell land, assignments or mortgages and notes, assignments of land sale contracts, deeds of assignment, easements, statutory liens, articles of incorporation and articles of dissolution relating to private corporations. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 72-711</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A power of attorney is not an instrument which must have indorsed on it a printed, typewritten or stamped statement showing the name and address of the individual who prepared the instrument and the signature of the individual who prepared such statement. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 73-736</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The name of the draftsman must appear on instruments such as contracts, chattel mortgages, and leases of personal property or instruments in which title to personal property or real estate is conveyed, granted, encumbered, or otherwise disposed of before such instruments can be recorded by the county clerk. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-76</cite>.

Such release in the case of a mortgage or deed of trust shall have the effect to reinstate the title in the mortgagor or grantor or person entitled thereto. Each entry in the marginal entry record shall be linked to its respective referenced instrument in the indexing system for the referenced instruments.
      </li>

       If a lien or mortgage is released by a deed of release, the clerk shall immediately, at the option of the clerk, either link the release and its filing location to its respective referenced instrument in the indexing system for the referenced instrument, or endorse on the margin of the record wherein the lien is retained “Released by deed of release (stating whether in whole or in part) lodged for record (giving date, deed book and page wherein such deed of release may be found)” and the clerk shall also attest such certificate.

Provided, however, that an assignee that reassigns the note prior to the thirtieth day after first acquiring the assignment may request that the subsequent assignee file the unfiled assignment with the new reassignment.

        Whether the estate of the assignee is regarded as merely equitable, and, nothing more than a lien, this section applies. Cunningham v. Estill, 68 S.W. 1081, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 559</cite>, 1902 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 436</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1902).

        Under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.360ol11" target="_self">KRS 382.360(1)</a></cite>, where a creditor mistakenly released its mortgage, the release dissolved the creditor’s interest in the property, and the creditor thus retained no interest in the property and there was no interest for <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a></cite> trustee to avoid. Even if the bankruptcy court considered the creditor’s possible equitable right to reinstate the mortgage to be an interest in the property that the trustee could avoid, the bankruptcy estate would have succeeded only to a released mortgage that would be subordinate to the intervening judicial lien creditors.

        Any attempted release by a person other than one entitled to do so is void. Ethington v. Rigg, 173 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 355</cite>, 191 S.W. 98, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 463</cite> (Ky. 1917).

        Where a note is payable to several obligees, any one of them may execute a valid release of note on record upon payment to him. Ethington v. Rigg, 173 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 355</cite>, 191 S.W. 98, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 463</cite> (Ky. 1917).

        Where attempted release is signed by one of the vendors, not in his individual capacity but as agent for a designated class of heirs, such release is invalid in absence of a showing of proof of agency. Ethington v. Rigg, 173 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 355</cite>, 191 S.W. 98, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 463</cite> (Ky. 1917).

       <p>
        Where creditor released its first mortgage even though the debtor still owed a balance, it could not rely on its second mortgage to encompass this balance as there was nothing in the agreement referred to in the second mortgage which suggested that it was anything but a free-standing agreement to borrow a sum certain; it did not implicate the debtor’s obligation under the first mortgage. Thus, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.260ol11" target="_self">KRS 382.260(1)</a></cite>, the first mortgage was dissolved. In re Colemire, 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 2816 (Bankr. E.D. Ky.

        A payment by mortgagor in good faith to the party to whom the record showed the right to receive it, without notice or knowledge of assignee’s interest in mortgage, and in accordance with the terms of mortgagor’s contract, and the release of the lien by the apparent holder thereof were valid and the mortgage was discharged.

       <p>
        Court would not reconsider its finding that the counties lacked a private right of action to enforce the requirement of this section that mortgage assignments be recorded as they were not among the three categories of persons that the Kentucky General Assembly protected when it passed the statute because the counties merely reasserted the same arguments that the court considered and rejected based on controlling Sixth Circuit precedent. Boyd County ex rel. Hedrick v. MERSCORP, Inc., 985 F. Supp. 2d 823, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59921 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2014</cite>).

       <p>
        Court would not certify the question of whether the counties were authorized to enforce the recording statute to the Kentucky Supreme Court because it could not be said that there was no controlling precedent for the court to apply, and the counties proposed question would not be determinative of the case.

        Because the damages for failing to record a mortgage assignment provided for in the Kentucky recording statutes were not properly characterized as a fine or penalty, but as liquidated damages, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 did not prohibit them from being assessed against the Federal Housing Finance Agency or the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”).

       The proper procedure for clearing records of a mistakenly filed mortgage is to have the parties to the mortgage file a deed of release or other instrument which complies with the statutory requirements necessary to terminate any mortgage except this deed of release or instrument should contain a clause which makes it clear that the release is being made only for the purposes of clearing the records in the county in which the mortgage was mistakenly filed and that the mortgage has been filed and continues to be in effect in the county of
    _________
    (where the land or the greater portion thereof lies) which instrument should be filed in the county where the original mortgage was filed and for which charge of the same fee for recording this instrument and noting the release should be made as if the mortgage had been properly filed in the first place; a marginal notation should be made on the mortgage book, reflecting that the release is being made only for the purpose of clearing the record and that the mortgage is properly filed in
    _________
    county and is still in effect. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-21</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.012" target="_blank">KRS 64.012</a></cite>, as amended in the 1980 regular session, the correct fee for recording a deed of release of a mortgage is $5.00 for each such instrument; the $5.00 fee for recording the deed of release includes one marginal notation made pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, then for each additional marginal notation relating to the deed of release, the fee is $1.50; thus where one deed of release is lodged for record, but which releases two different mortgages, the total fee is $6.50. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-484</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the Farmers Home Loan Administration lodged with the county clerk a release of real estate mortgage instrument, qualifying as “deed of release” under this section and expressly referring to three (3) different mortgages by book and page numbers, the clerk needed only charge to $5.00 for the first mortgage and $1.50 for each additional mortgage rather than $5.00 for each mortgage, since the explicit reference to this section in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.012" target="_blank">KRS 64.012</a></cite>, as well as the immediate juxtaposition of the $1.50 fee for “each additional marginal notation” to the $5.00 fee for recording and certifying a deed of release, must be read together to make sense. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-329</cite>.

        Unlike those cases where mailing a communication is an effective means of giving notice, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.365" target="_self">KRS 382.365</a></cite> expressly requires that a notice must be received before a penalty may be imposed; it is an element of the cause of action and is the date from which the penalties are calculated. Union Planters Bank, N.A. v. Hutson, 210 S.W.3d 163, 2006 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 170</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).

        Circuit Court erred in holding that when a facsimile was transmitted to a mortgagee, a facsimile could not constitute written notice under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.365" target="_self">KRS 382.365</a></cite> because under the 2004 version of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.365" target="_self">KRS 382.365</a></cite>, which was the version in effect at the time that the facsimile was transmitted, a facsimile transmission, if received by the recipient, constituted “written notice”; because the 2004 version of the statute does not define what constitutes “written notice,” only reasonable notice is required to be provided. Riley v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, 316 S.W.3d 884, 2009 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 43</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).

        The current version of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.365" target="_self">KRS 382.365</a></cite> does not apply retroactively because the legislature did not specify in the current version of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.365" target="_self">KRS 382.365</a></cite> that the provisions concerning written notice were to be applied retroactively, and there is no legislative intent for those provisions to be so applied. Riley v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, 316 S.W.3d 884, 2009 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 43</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit Court erred in holding that an attorney’s signature stamp on a facsimile cast doubt on whether notice of the failure to release a lien was sufficient because a mortgagee did not argue that the attorney did not sanction the use of his signature stamp on the letter that was sent by facsimile. Riley v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, 316 S.W.3d 884, 2009 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 43</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).

        In mortgagors’
    action alleging that a mortgagee owed them penalties under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.365" target="_self">KRS 382.365</a></cite> for failing to release a lien, the Circuit Court erred in finding that the original lender should have been given written notice because the original lender was not a lienholder at the time a facsimile was transmitted to the mortgagee and could not release a lien it no longer held, and in an affidavit, the mortgagee’s vice president acknowledged that the mortgagee held the lien; therefore, the mortgagee was the “lienholder” of the lien on mortgagors’
    property, and the lien on the property was ultimately released by the mortgagee after the mortgagors filed their lawsuit. Riley v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, 316 S.W.3d 884, 2009 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 43</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).

    <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.365ol14" target="_self">KRS 382.365(4)</a></cite>, made mandatory by the word “shall” in accordance with

CitiFinancial, Inc. v. Bratton, 2012 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1020 (Ky. Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2012), aff'd on other grounds, 415 S.W.3d 625, 2013 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 650</cite> (Ky. 2013).

        Since under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.365" target="_self">KRS 382.365</a></cite> the mortgagors had a duty to act reasonably and in good faith and the mortgagors’
    rights flowed from a contract, in which there was an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the mortgagors were not entitled to sleep on their rights and unfairly inflate the liquidated damages. Union Planters Bank, N.A. v. Hutson, 210 S.W.3d 163, 2006 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 170</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the damages for failing to record a mortgage assignment provided for in the Kentucky recording statutes were not properly characterized as a fine or penalty, but as liquidated damages, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 did not prohibit them from being assessed against the Federal Housing Finance Agency or the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”). Higgins v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43278 (E.D. Ky. Mar. 31, 2014), amended, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91362 (E.D. Ky. July 3, 2014).

       <p>
        Circuit Court erred in finding that when a mortgage was not released, the mortgagee still had a valid and active lien on the property based on a re-finance transaction carried out by the mortgagors, wherein they borrowed additional monies from the mortgagee to pay it off because <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.365" target="_self">KRS 382.365</a></cite> did not contain an exception to its provisions concerning penalties to be awarded for a lienholder’s failure to release a lien; the statute does not provide that penalties are unwarranted in the event that the lienholder that failed to release the lien held a subsequent lien on the property. Riley v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, 316 S.W.3d 884, 2009 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 43</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Homeowners were not entitled to statutory penalties under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.365ol14" target="_self">KRS 382.365(4)</a></cite> because a finance company’s error in recording a release of deed was inadvertent, could have easily been cured upon notice from the homeowners, and did not impact the homeowners’ ability to procure another loan. Hall v. Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., 2010 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 135</cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2010 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1004 (Ky. Ct. App. July 23, 2010).

       <p>
        Trial court erred in denying a subservicer's summary judgment motion because the mortgage trustee executed a limited power of attorney (LPOA) to the mortgage servicer that gave the servicer authority to execute an additional LPOA to the subservicer, the subservicer's documents complied with the technical requirements for recording, and the county clerk's rejection of the deed of release exposed both the subservicer and the underlying mortgage-backed securitized trust to potentially harsh penalties for failure to timely release the mortgage. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. v. Blevins, 494 S.W.3d 510, 2016 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 115</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2016).

       <p>
        Trial court erred in awarding summary judgment and damages to the owners because there was no proof that a mortgage given by the buyers of a parcel of the owners’
    land to the lender was satisfied, and the statute at issue did not to a situation where the lender erroneously filed the mortgage on the owners’ property. Bratton v. CitiFinancial, Inc., 415 S.W.3d 625, 2013 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 650</cite> (Ky. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly granted a lender summary judgment because a borrower failed to carry her burden of proving a novation or that the underlying obligation had been satisfied; the borrower's former husband continued to make payments on the debt the couple incurred, and the plain language of a subsequent note and agreement expressly referred to the original note and its obligations and the property as collateral and indicated the intent to modify rather than replace the loan obligation.

        A deed made by an attorney in fact, in pursuance of an unrecorded power of attorney, is good as between the grantor and those claiming under the grantee where no right of creditor is involved even though evidence is insufficient to establish its contents or due execution since an agent with verbal authority to convey land could bind his principal and put grantee in hostile and adverse possession of which grantor would be presumed to have notice.

        This section was enacted to protect lis pendens purchasers by requiring notice of pendency of actions to enforce liens to be filed and recorded in much the same way that a deed must be recorded.

       </p>
       <p>
        This section was enacted to protect the subsequent bona fide purchaser of the property, and the statute does not purport to create any additional rights that a party might have in the property.

        This section and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.450" target="_self">KRS 382.450</a></cite> relating to lis pendens notices, do not have the effect of invalidating execution liens. In re Wesley Corp., 18 F. Supp. 347, 1937 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2091 (D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1937</cite>).

       <p>
        The requirement of filing of notice of an attachment lien in no sense impairs or affects the obligation of a contract entered into prior to enactment of the statute by action of attachment brought subsequent to enactment of the statute. Boltz v. Boain, 90 S.W. 593, 28 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 842</cite> (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        The doctrine of lis pendens, as to persons and property within its operation, is that the court having jurisdiction of the suit or action is entitled to proceed to the final exercise of that jurisdiction and that it is beyond the power of any of the parties to the action to prevent its doing so by any transfer or other act made or done after the service of the writ or the happening of such other act as may be necessary to the commencement of the lis pendens and the final judgment or decree of the court may be carried into effect notwithstanding the attempted dealing with the subject matter of the action. Roberts v. Cardwell, 154 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 483</cite>, 157 S.W. 711, 1913 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 82</cite> (Ky. 1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has no retrospective effect. Likens v. Pate, 160 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 319</cite>, 169 S.W. 734, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 446</cite> (Ky. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        At common law a purchaser pendente lite took subject to a judgment rendered in the action and was bound thereby, but under this section, this rule does not apply to a subsequent purchaser for value and without notice, unless notice as herein provided is filed in county clerk’s office. Watts v. Noble, 203 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 644</cite>, 262 S.W. 1114, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 988</cite> (Ky. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to adoption of this section the lis pendens doctrine was recognized as part of the common law of the state and was applicable to all kinds of personal property with the exception of negotiable instruments and articles of ordinary commerce sold in the usual way and the adoption of this section did not abrogate but only modified the lis pendens doctrine theretofore in effect and left same in full force and effect with reference to proceedings affecting all kinds of personal property within the doctrine. P. A. Stark Piano Co. v. Fannin, 212 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 640</cite>, 279 S.W. 1080, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 211</cite> (Ky. 1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lis pendens is notice of all facts apparent on the face of the pleadings and exhibits and of all other facts of which they would put a person of ordinary prudence on inquiry.

        A foreign judgment holder’s filing and service of a lis pendens notice under this section was not sufficient compliance with the requirements of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.39.html#tXXXIXc426s426.720" target="_blank">KRS 426.720</a></cite> so as to create a lien on a date before the recording of a tax lien by the Internal Revenue Service. Redondo Constr. Corp. v. United States, 157 F.3d 1060, 1998 FED App. 0310P, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 26082 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1998</cite>).

        It was undisputed that the bank filed a lis pendens notice in compliance with <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.440" target="_self">KRS 382.440</a></cite> and listed the mortgage corporation as a party in interest; it did not matter that the bank was the party that actually filed the lis pendens notice. Rather, because the mortgage corporation was designated as a party in interest on the notice, the bankruptcy trustee was on constructive notice of its interest; it would have made little sense to require a creditor, already listed on a lis pendens notice, to file another lis pendens notice to protect its interest.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The interest of a pendente lite lienholder in real property does not survive the judicial sale of the property incident to a foreclosure action to which the lienholder was neither a party nor had actual notice of the proceedings. While <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.39.html#tXXXIXc426s426.690" target="_blank">KRS 426.690</a></cite> clearly requires the plaintiff in a foreclosure action to name the holders of other liens in its petition, there is no statutory requirement to name those who acquire a lien after the filing of the petition.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Practitioners representing protesters of zoning changes can more thoroughly protect their clients’ interests by filing notices of lis pendens, by obtaining quicker services of pro- cess, and by seeking injunctions to prevent the issuance of building permits on contested properties; furthermore those individuals representing buyers, owners, builders or lenders must be certain that any new construction or building modifications be done in good faith; finally, those individuals responsible for enforcing local zoning laws must be extremely cautious in issuing building permits in order to assure that the character and integrity of a zone is maintained.

        The filing of lis pendens does not independently create a lien against property, and does not take priority over liens filed subsequent to lis pendens but prior to the entry of a dissolution decree.

        Creditors were entitled to summary judgment on the bankruptcy trustee’s claim that the estate had priority on the proceeds from the sale of encumbered property, pursuant to 11 USCS § 544; even if the mortgage was defective under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.38.html#tXXXVIIIc423s423.130" target="_blank">KRS 423.130</a></cite>, the subsequently filed lis pendens, properly recorded pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.440" target="_self">KRS 382.440</a></cite>, put the trustee on, at a minimum, inquiry notice concerning creditors’
    underlying interest in the property and the trustee did not thus have status as a bona fide purchaser. Johnson v. CIT Group/Consumer Fin., Inc. (In re Franklin), 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 3738 (Bankr. E.D. Ky. Jan. 25, 2006).

       <p>
        Appellant had nothing more than a general creditor’s claim against an estate, and thus the claim against appellee did not have a direct attachment to the real property in question, and the recording of a lis pendens, for purposes of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.440" target="_self">KRS 382.440</a></cite>, was inappropriate and ineffective to encumber a sale of the property to appellee.

        Although it was determined that a commercial property lessee had asserted no valid right, title, interest in, or claim to the disputed premises, as it had the right to maintain its notice of lis pendens throughout the pendency of the action pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc382s382.440" target="_self">KRS 382.440</a></cite>, the trial court erred when it dissolved the notice of lis pendens.

        One who took a mortgage on land pending an action to enforce a vendor’s lien thereon was under the common law a lis pendens purchaser, and therefore bound by a judgment rendered in that action enforcing the lien, though the deed to the mortgagor did not show that the purchase money was unpaid, and therefore but for the pending action the mortgagee would not have been affected by the lien which existed as between the parties to the deed.

       A lis pendens cannot be taken from the quarterly court or other court inferior to the circuit court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-317</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law relates to actions affecting real property only. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-317</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no specific time limitation for filing and enforcing lis pendens. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-317</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A creditor, bona fide or other purchaser, who has no actual notice of a pending suit to enforce a mechanic’s lien may disregard a mechanic’s lien which has been filed longer than one year where no lis pendens affecting the subject property appears of record during the one year period of limitations. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-339</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A filed mechanic’s lien is not the type of fact which would raise a duty of inquiry under the rationale of Dick v. Jasper, 195 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 539</cite>, 242 S.W. 834, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 345</cite> (1922) where the one year statute of limitations has passed and no lis pendens has appeared of record. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-339</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this section is to protect those who would be lis pendens purchasers by requiring notice to be filed of the pendency of an action to enforce the lien, and it is clear that a mechanic’s lien falls within the literal language and intended purview of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-339</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was enacted after <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.31.html#tXXXIc376s376.090ol12" target="_blank">KRS 376.090(2)</a></cite>, and, therefore, the provisions and requirements of this section shall control those of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.31.html#tXXXIc376s376.090ol12" target="_blank">KRS 376.090(2)</a></cite> where the two are in conflict. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-339</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the purchaser of a delinquent tax bill pays the total bond sale bill to the sheriff for the purchase of the real property for delinquent taxes, the purchased delinquent tax bills are not property recordable in the lis pendens book under this section, since the clerk of the court must maintain a “certificates of delinquency” book under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc134s134.450" target="_blank">KRS 134.450</a></cite> for such purposes; however, if the purchaser institutes a suit to enforce his lien in the property after three (3) years from the issuance of the certificate of delinquency have elapsed, the purchaser may file a memorandum of such litigation in the lis pendens book. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-82</cite>.

        The primary purpose of requiring the date of attachment to be contained in the body of the lis pendens notice is to put subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers on notice and where a prior lis pendens, correct in every respect except the date was not contained in the body of the notice, was not only on record but the date of filing was attached by the county clerk, persons filing an attachment on the property subsequently filed with notice of the lis pendens and the lis pendens took precedent over the attachments filed subsequently.

        Judgment creditor having filed notice under this section and having shown good faith in her execution proceedings against real estate of judgment debtor and who was without notice of any possessory or unrecorded title rights acquired a good and valid execution lien upon the property for the amount of her debt, which was prior and paramount to right or title of grantee under alleged unrecorded deed who was not in possession at the time of the levy.

        The meaning of this section is that if the mortgage states the limit of indebtedness and it is in excess of the face amount of the mortgage, security of the amount up to the limit of indebtedness over the face amount is allowed; thus, it covers future loans. Bank of Maysville v. Brock, 375 S.W.2d 814, 1964 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 434</cite> (Ky. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        A notice in a mortgage that a lien covers the amount loaned, plus possible future advances, has been held to grant priority to the future advances against a lien filed after the initial mortgage but before the advances. Liberty Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Vanderkraats, 899 S.W.2d 511, 1995 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 114</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1995).

        Term “additional indebtedness,” as used in the statute, is not intended to require a mortgage to identify the maximum amount of the indebtedness resulting from the original loan, including interest and other fees. Rather, “additional indebtedness” refers to new, future, or additional amounts loaned between the parties. Asher v. Morgan Stanley Mortg. (In re Asher), 2020 Bankr. LEXIS 1342 (Bankr. E.D. Ky.

        Properly recorded mortgage was notice of the original face amount of $86,000.00 and also an additional $5,000.00, since the mortgage stipulated that the maximum additional indebtedness which might be secured thereby was the sum of $5,000.00.

       <p>
        Mechanic’s lienholder’s lien was superior to a mortgagee’s security interest in the same real property because once the mortgagee’s mortgage, which had been created before the mechanic’s lien was filed, was paid, it could not use the future advances clause in that mortgage to assert that a subsequent loan to the mortgagor was secured by the earlier mortgage and that, therefore, its mortgage was superior to the mechanic’s lien.

        Extent of additional indebtedness could be determined by the exercise of ordinary discretion and diligence merely by referring to the mortgage.

       <p>
        Trial court properly granted a lender summary judgment because a borrower failed to carry her burden of proving a novation or that the underlying obligation had been satisfied; the borrower's former husband continued to make payments on the debt the couple incurred, and the plain language of a subsequent note and agreement expressly referred to the original note and its obligations and the property as collateral and indicated the intent to modify rather than replace the loan obligation.

        The fundamental element of “distress” is the taking of another’s personal property out of his possession, either for holding or for sale, in order to obtain satisfaction of a past due rent claim and the cutting off of gas and electric service for nonpayment of past due bill was not “distress” as the term is understood in the law of landlord and tenant.

        Where an assignee of rent note procured a distress warrant against a tenant and subtenants, who executed a bond with sureties to discharge the levy, upon motion for judgment against the sureties the court determined that the assignee of a rent note is not entitled to the right of distress, in absence of a statutory provision therefor, unless the lease or land also be included in the assignment. Hutsell v. Deposit Bank of Paris, 102 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 410</cite>, 43 S.W. 469, 19 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1481</cite>, 1897 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        A covenant to pay an agreed rent is a covenant which runs with the land and binds both the lessee and the grantee of the reversionary interest, which the grantee or assignee may enforce against the lessee, for the simple and fundamental reason that the grantee by his purchase is vested with all the legal rights and remedies as would have been available to his grantor as against the lessee.

        Although at common law the property even of a stranger, if on the leased premises, was, in some circumstances, subject to the landlord’s lien for rent, under Kentucky law only the personal property of the lessee, the assignee, or under tenant or subtenant is liable to distress and wife of tenant who was under no obligation to pay her husband rent or share her proceeds with him was not an assignee or subtenant and her property was not subject to the landlord’s lien for rent.

        Where original lessor asserted lien on personal property of subtenant then on premises of store building for 11 months rent by suit and attachment and, before matter was heard by court subtenant paid two (2) months rent and vacated, court should have adjudged a lien on the personal property of the subtenant for the remaining nine months of the term under the sublease although tenant had vacated since <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.070" target="_self">KRS 383.070</a></cite> does not make the lien depend upon the occupancy of the premises but gives a lien for the specified time for rent “due or to become due.” Bowling v.

       Where a plaintiff files for attachment under this section the judge of the quarterly court should not collect $5.00 for state tax since there was no original action in quarterly court under this law. Instead, after the return of the attachment by the sheriff to the circuit court, the clerk should collect the state tax of $5.00 before the court proceeds further. Only one state tax of $5.00 is required to be paid in the original action of a case. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-802</cite>.

        In a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 case in which a renter asserted a Fourth Amendment claim against two deputies because they assisted his landlords in wrongfully seizing all his personal property without due process during the execution of an eviction order, and the deputies appealed the district court’s denial of their motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, the deputies pointed to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.070" target="_self">KRS 383.070</a></cite>, which allowed a landlord lien on a tenant’s personal property to secure payment of rent.

        Effect of recorded conditional sales contract was to vest title to mine cars in purchaser with lien in favor of seller for the purchaser price and when purchaser placed the cars in a mine he was leasing, the lien of the seller of the mine cars had priority over lien of lessor of the mine for royalties.

        Generally, although there are exceptions, a tenant in possession of premises cannot attorn to a stranger or lease the premises from a stranger, or in any manner or way renounce his allegiance to or set up a title hostile to his landlord, without first obtaining the consent of his landlord or renouncing his tenancy by removing from the leased premises.

        New owner of property is not a “stranger” within the meaning of this section, and a tenant may attorn to the owner without the former owner’s consent. Carr v. Smith, 281 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 750</cite>, 137 S.W.2d 415, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 107</cite> (Ky. 1940). See Roberts v.

       </p>
       <p>
        A tenant could, under no circumstances, after the lease and entry under his landlord, attorn to another without his consent, or deny the title or claim under which he entered, whether the title or claim was good or indifferent.

        A tenant may not attorn to a purchaser from the landlord without landlord’s consent until the purchase has been completed by delivery of title. Person who had contracted to purchase land, but who had not as yet received a deed, could not claim possession through an alleged attornment by the tenant of the land, for the purpose of maintaining an action for forcible entry, since he is a stranger and the attornment would be void.

       A landlord shall have a superior lien, against which the tenant shall not be entitled to any exemption, upon the whole crop of the tenant raised upon the leased or rented premises to reimburse the landlord for money or property furnished to the tenant to enable him to raise the crop, or to subsist while carrying out his contract of tenancy. But, the lien of the landlord shall not continue for more than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the expiration of the term. If the property upon which there is a lien is removed openly from the leased premises, without fraudulent intent, and not returned, the landlord shall have a superior lien upon the property so removed for fifteen (15) days from the date of its removal, and may enforce his lien against the property wherever found.

        Tenant could not wrongfully take tobacco from landlord and place it in possession of warehouseman so as to create a lien upon it for warehouse charges superior to landlord’s right in it under this section, or deprive him of the right to have possession restored to him. Brown v. Noel, 52 S.W. 849, 21 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 648</cite>, 1899 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 373</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence disclosed landlord did not have a lien within the meaning of subsection (1) of this section on tobacco crop of tenant and bank was awarded first lien under its mortgage on the crop. Royalty v. Winchester Bank, 264 S.W.2d 657, 1954 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 680</cite> (Ky. 1954).

        Landlord who made advances to tenant upon agreement for lien upon crop, had a lien upon tenant’s share of crop independent of statute, and could enforce lien after 120 days from end of term by general attachment and levy on tenant’s share of crop. Browning v. Crawford, 145 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 279</cite>, 140 S.W. 530, 1911 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 843</cite> (Ky. 1911).

       <p>
        Landlord’s lien for advances provided by subsection (1) was not lost where action to enforce was brought within 120 days after tobacco was wrongfully removed by tenant from barn furnished by landlord in compliance with contract although it was not brought within 120 days of removal from leased land on which it was grown. Brown v. Noel, 52 S.W. 849, 21 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 648</cite>, 1899 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 373</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        The remedy given by subsection (2) of this section to enforce lien by distress warrant or attachment is simply cumulative and landlord could proceed by an action to enforce his lien as in other cases where liens exist on personal property. Brown v. Noel, 52 S.W. 849, 21 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 648</cite>, 1899 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 373</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where tenant during period for which lien of landlord for advances existed delivered his interest in crop to landlord as security, the landlord’s lien was thereby preserved the same as if landlord had instituted legal proceedings to enforce lien.

        It was incumbent on tenant to pay landlord for advances under this section before leaving premises and where he had made arrangements to move 30 miles away, his crop was all made and the larger part of the corn converted and he was getting ready to get away when distress warrant was sworn out without making arrangements for payment of advances which he admitted he owed, the landlord was authorized to distrain for the advances and tenant could not recover double damages or value for wrongful seizure and sale of crops under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.020" target="_self">KRS 383.020</a></cite> where the evidence was insufficient to show advances were not to be repaid until crops were sold since the general rule as to advances made without time being fixed for payment become due simultaneously with the promise applied rather than the rule that rent, no time being fixed for payment, is due at end of term.

        The mere right of an employe to occupy living quarters belonging to his employer does not create the landlord-tenant relation, and the right to occupy the house terminates when the employe ceases to work; but where the occupation of the living quarters is more than an incident to employment, and the employer has parted with the control of the premises by collecting rent or treating the use as part of the employe’s compensation, the landlord and tenant relation is created.

        Where lease of dwelling by employer to employe provided that it should terminate at once on termination of employment, the court, in forcible detainer action, was without jurisdiction to determine whether employment was terminated in violation of national labor relations act when employe was discharged for union activities, but had jurisdiction, on undenied allegation that employment was terminated, to hold that lease was terminated, since fact that state court has no jurisdiction of questions arising under labor relations act does not deprive it of jurisdiction to determine landlord-tenant questions.

        Subsection (1) of this section is for the protection of both landlord and tenant, and where renting is for a year or more, to expire on a named day, the tenant may abandon the premises within 90 days after the term without liability for a longer period than he holds, unless he agrees to remain longer. He is a tenant by sufferance for 90 days and may be expelled without notice within that time, but if permitted to remain longer his tenancy as to time and price is regulated by the original contract.

        This section did not apply to a tenant who was a party to a suit for condemnation and who was awarded compensation for his leasehold but who because of the prolonged litigation between the condemnation and the owner was not disturbed in his tenancy and held over 90 days after its expiration.

       <p>
        A tenancy from month to month is not a lease for the term of one month or a letting by the month which is for a fixed term and for which no notice is required under this section but is a lease for an indeterminate period for which a 30 day notice is required and landlord’s notice to “at once vacate premises” was insufficient to terminate tenancy from month to month.

        Where tenant lived in a hotel for a number of years but had no written contract with landlord and had under an oral agreement paid $25 per month in advance on or before the 15th day of each month this section did not apply as her occupancy was not under a contract for less than a year terminable on a certain day on which day she was required to surrender the premises without notice from the landlord but was a tenancy from month to month which entitled her to one month’s notice to terminate the lease.

        Where tenant did not extend a commercial lease under its terms which provided for a written notice to exercise its two (2) -year extensions, and where nothing in the lease between the parties suggested that they had elected not to be bound by subsection (1) of this section, neither optional two (2) -year extension was ever created but subsection (1) of this section did create a one-year tenancy.

       <p>
        Lease’s hold-over clause applied when a landlord did not seek to recover property within 90 days of the lease’s expiration because (1) the lease’s unambiguous holdover terms had to be strictly enforced, (2) there was no reason to resort to statutory gap-filling provisions, and (3) the landlord’s failure to seek inflated rental amounts due under those terms did not invalidate that section’s purpose and effect.

        Under this section, once a lease’s terms and the holdover period expire, the landlord has the right to evict a tenant who remains in possession; absent eviction the tenant has a tenancy of sufferance and a tenancy at sufferance is a possessor interest sufficient to trigger the bankruptcy court’s jurisdiction.

        District court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendant on the issue of whether the lease was renewed through July 31, 2010, because plaintiff did not outwardly manifest an intent to exercise the renewal option; without some objective demonstration of intent to exercise the renewal option, plaintiff’s continued occupancy of the farmland was governed by <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.160ol11" target="_self">KRS 383.160(1)</a></cite> rather than by the terms of the lease.

        Circuit court properly entered summary judgment against a tenant because the tenant did not qualify as a holdover tenant where the lease at issue was for a one-year term starting January 20, 2011, the lease made no mention of a crop year, industry standards, or November 1 as the contract’s end date, the parties treated the contract as continuing after its expiration by operation of law into subsequent three one-year term contracts; thereafter, the tenant did not occupy the land for a period of 90 days after the expiration of the 2014 lease, and the owner and the tenant engaged in fruitless contract negotiations, after which the owner turned the tenant out of possession by informing it that the lands would be leased to another.

        Because a lessee failed to exercise a plain and unambiguous renewal option in accordance with its terms, it became a holdover tenant under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.160ol11" target="_self">KRS 383.160(1)</a></cite>, and the lessee was not entitled to a declaration that it held a five-year tenancy and purchase option under the same terms and conditions as set forth in the original lease. The lease did not automatically renew by virtue of the lessee’s continued possession and payment of rent; rather, the renewal provision required the parties to enter a new lease. Ala.

        Lease with privilege of renewal for stated period with rents to be paid monthly was not governed by the law but involved only the construction of the contract and was not to be confused with leases providing for the giving of notice, nor to be governed by the rules applicable to holding after an expiration of a term in which the lease did not provide for either its renewal or extension, but which terminated by its own terms at the expiration of the period covered by it which latter class of lease was governed by this section.

        No obligation was imposed by this section on the landlord to restore roof destroyed by wear and tear and in absence of a provision in the lease the common law applied and tenant could not set off the cost of replacing the roof against the rent although lease imposed no obligation on lessee to restore roof destroyed by wear and tear.

        This section does not impose an obligation upon the landlord to repair or rebuild, but its purpose was to modify the rigor of the common law, and to relieve the tenant from the liability to rebuild under covenant that he would keep the premises in repair, and to relieve him from the payment of rent during remainder of term if the leased building was destroyed by fire or other casualty without his fault or neglect. Thomas v. Conrad, 114 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 841</cite>, 71 S.W. 903, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1630</cite>, 1903 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 37</cite> (Ky. 1903).

        Tenant was under no obligation to restore wall which fell because of excavation on adjoining lot since there was no distinct provision in the lease for repair upon such a casualty.

        The assignee of a tenant can obtain no greater rights as against his landlord than the tenant himself possessed. American Coal Land Co. v. Miller, 182 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 51</cite>, 206 S.W. 18, 1918 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 313</cite> (Ky. 1918).

        Where written coal lease was for a term of two years, with privilege of extending the same for three years longer, an assignment under subsection (2) of this section did not operate as a forfeiture of the lease to the lessor. Addison v. Brandenburg, 202 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 580</cite>, 260 S.W. 381, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 767</cite> (Ky. 1924).

        As lease was assignable without landlord’s consent, provision for extension of rental period passed to assignees when lease was assigned even though lease did not so provide.

       <p>
        Restrictive covenant on the right to sublease did not prevent an assignment of a lease for 10 years or require compliance with conditions prescribed for subleasing as it at most merely constituted a ground for forfeiture at the option of the lessor which could be waived or relinquished by accepting rental from the assignee with knowledge of the assignment. Cities Service Oil Co. v. Taylor, 242 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 157</cite>, 45 S.W.2d 1039, 1932 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 235</cite> (Ky. 1932).

        Where in seeking cancellation of lease the lessor charged violations of the contract by lessee’s attempted transfer of his lease without consent of lessor or his assignee, proof failed in that respect though it was shown that a third person had opened a new entry toward the right of the main entry of lessee under some sort of working agreement but lessor had knowledge of it and accepted royalties under it. Robinson v. Bailey, 278 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 57</cite>, 128 S.W.2d 179, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 374</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        A lease by a tenant for a term less than two years of a wall for advertising purposes, without the landlord’s consent, was void as to the landlord; and, the painting of the sign upon the wall by the sublessee being unlawful, the sublessee became liable to the landlord for the thereby sustained damages.

        Postconviction relief should have been granted because appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel based on advice to plead guilty to second-degree burglary under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc511s511.030" target="_blank">KRS 511.030</a></cite> by determining, without any research, that the absence of an ownership or rental agreement negated any lawful status on the premises; this rendered the plea not knowingly and voluntarily entered into. There was no dispute that appellant legally resided at the location at issue, and a showing of a tenancy-at-will that was not terminated would have constituted a defense against the burglary charge.

       <p>
        Neither the title nor the legal right to possession is involved in a forcible entry proceeding, but, if the relation of landlord and tenant exists, an action of forcible detainer may be maintained by one having the right to possession. Moore v. Ramsey, 272 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 582</cite>, 114 S.W.2d 1101, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 165</cite> (Ky. 1938).

        2. Question of Title.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Forcible entry and detainer proceedings do not in any wise involve the title to land in dispute, but simply whether the entry was without the consent of the person having actual possession. Caldwell v. McVean, 119 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 30</cite>, 82 S.W. 992, 26 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 948</cite>, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 139</cite> (Ky. 1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Question of title cannot be tried in action of forcible entry and detainer. Lovely v. Stacey, 171 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 338</cite>, 188 S.W. 389, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 348</cite> (Ky. 1916).

        3. Definition of Tenant.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Tenant is defined as one who occupies the lands or premises of another in subordination to that other’s title and with his assent, express or implied. Alexander v. Gardner, 123 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 552</cite>, 96 S.W. 818, 29 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 958</cite>, 1906 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 179</cite> (Ky. 1906).

        4. Forcible Entry.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A forcible entry is one without the consent of person having actual possession. Although appellant had right of entry, if appellee was in actual possession when entry was made without his consent, appellant was guilty of forcible entry. Young v. Young, 109 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 123</cite>, 58 S.W. 592, 58 S.W. 593, 1900 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 187</cite> (Ky. 1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        None but those in actual possession when the forcible entry is made can maintain the writ, neither right of possession nor constructive possession will avail. Cuyler v. Estis, 64 S.W. 673, 23 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1063</cite> (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a tenancy be determined and the tenant has gone away and locked up the house, consenting that the legal owner, either in person or by his tenants, should take possession of the property, and he does so, under such a state of case he would not be guilty of forcible entry. Robinson v. Marshall, 78 S.W. 904, 25 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1785</cite> (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Refusal to abide by arbitration decision did not constitute a forcible entry by party in possession both before and after arbitration, since agreement to arbitrate was not a surrender of actual possession. Hord v. Sartain, 86 S.W. 692, 27 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 796</cite> (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        Actual possession by agent is sufficient to enable party to maintain action for forcible entry. McCormick v. McDowell, 121 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 832</cite>, 90 S.W. 541, 28 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 854</cite>, 1906 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 261</cite> (Ky. 1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant cannot justify an entry of land in possession of another by showing title or right of entry. McCormick v. McDowell, 121 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 832</cite>, 90 S.W. 541, 28 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 854</cite>, 1906 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 261</cite> (Ky. 1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only legitimate inquiry on trial of forcible entry is whether defendant entered upon land which at the time was in the actual possession of plaintiff. McCormick v. McDowell, 121 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 832</cite>, 90 S.W. 541, 28 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 854</cite>, 1906 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 261</cite> (Ky. 1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where land was vacant, both appellant and appellees had deeds, appellees, by their agent, first took possession and fenced land in, and appellant knocked fence down, made an entry and fenced lot in, appellant was clearly guilty of forcible entry under this section. Check v. Reiter, 102 S.W. 287, 31 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 249</cite> (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceedings of forcible entry, it does not matter how one gains possession of land, he is entitled to hold it until ousted by proper legal proceedings. Holman v. Parsons, 162 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 454</cite>, 172 S.W. 920, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 92</cite> (Ky. 1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to maintain an action of forcible entry, plaintiff must at the time of the alleged forcible entry be in actual possession, that is, in the occupancy, of the premises, and neither right of possession nor constructive possession is sufficient. Lovely v. Stacey, 171 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 338</cite>, 188 S.W. 389, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 348</cite> (Ky. 1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff was neither in actual occupancy of premises nor did the relation of landlord and tenant exist, an action of forcible entry does not lie and trial court erred in not directing a verdict in favor of defendant. Lovely v. Stacey, 171 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 338</cite>, 188 S.W. 389, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 348</cite> (Ky. 1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        In forcible entry action, only question is whether defendant forcibly entered upon and was depriving plaintiff of possession. Conley v. Shepherd, 237 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 128</cite>, 35 S.W.2d 5, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 562</cite> (Ky. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it is established that defendant did not make a forcible entry, but came into possession of premises by lease, only the landlord could prosecute an action for forcible detainer against him. Hargis v. All-States Realty Co., 278 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 82</cite>, 128 S.W.2d 213, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 383</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grantee who had not acquired title because deed had not been delivered could not maintain forcible entry action against grantor and tenant’s attornment to grantee was void under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.100" target="_self">KRS 383.100</a></cite>. Noble v. Neace, 293 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 496</cite>, 169 S.W.2d 308, 1943 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 646</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action of forcible entry protects merely the actual possession of real estate to a party having such possession, regardless of how such possession was acquired, and neither title nor value is involved. Ledford v. Hall, 181 F.2d 494, 1950 U.S. App. LEXIS 2627 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1950</cite>).

        5. Possession.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Lease is admissible in evidence to show extent of possession thereunder. Clark v. Langenbach, 130 F. 755, 1904 U.S. App. LEXIS 4216 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1904</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        A widow who had surrendered her homestead under duress and in ignorance of her rights, although she had a right of entry and a suit was pending to determine title, was guilty of forcible entry when she took peaceable possession without consent, of vacant and locked house which was in actual possession of her nephew by marriage. Young v. Young, 109 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 123</cite>, 58 S.W. 592, 58 S.W. 593, 1900 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 187</cite> (Ky. 1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, any overt acts indicating a purpose to occupy and not to abandon the premises, will satisfy the requirements as to possession. Robinson v. Marshall, 78 S.W. 904, 25 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1785</cite> (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where land in question was an island which plaintiff rented to tenants through an agent who controlled the land, plaintiff had possession even though land was not occupied by tenant at time of defendant’s entry. McCormick v. McDowell, 121 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 832</cite>, 90 S.W. 541, 28 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 854</cite>, 1906 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 261</cite> (Ky. 1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a claimant enters upon land under a deed describing a boundary with sufficient accuracy that it can be run by a surveyor, and the boundary lines have been located and plainly marked, he is in actual possession to the full extent of the boundary described in his deed so long as he is in the actual possession of any part thereof claiming the whole, except insofar as portions thereof are held adversely by actual occupancy and user. New York-Kentucky Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Miller, 187 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 742</cite>, 220 S.W. 535, 1920 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 199</cite> (Ky. 1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgagor who was in possession of land became tenant of landlord when mortgagee purchased the land at a foreclosure sale and the mortgagee who was then the landlord could obtain possession of the premises by forcible detainer. Pemberton v. Hardin, 258 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 538</cite>, 80 S.W.2d 589, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 204</cite> (Ky. 1935).

       <p>
        The procedure for forcible entry and detainer cases is provided in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.200" target="_self">KRS 383.200</a></cite> to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.285" target="_self">383.285;</a></cite> and is exclusive of all other remedies. Mayhew v. Kentucky River Coal Corp., 238 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 509</cite>, 38 S.W.2d 452, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 283</cite> (Ky. 1931). See Hoskins v.

       <p>
        A forcible entry and detainer action is intended to be a summary action, with procedures clearly limited by the provisions of this chapter; a trial court cannot expand upon these procedures by ordering discovery pursuant to such an action. Baker v. Ryan, 967 S.W.2d 591, 1997 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 90</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).

       <p>
        Question of title is not involved in a forcible detainer action but only the right to possession so a judgment is not a bar to an action to recover property. Weber v. Grand Lodge, F. &amp; A. M., 169 F. 522, 1909 U.S. App. LEXIS 4599 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 215 U.S. 606, 30 S. Ct. 406, 54 L. Ed. 346, 1909 U.S. LEXIS 1955 (U.S. 1909), overruled in part, Lindsey v. Greene, 649 F.2d 425, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 13180 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1981</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trustee of tenant in bankruptcy had no salable interest in lease or premises where tenant who was found guilty in an action of forcible detainer failed to file traverse. In re Van Da Grift Motor Car Co., 192 F. 1015, 1912 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1847 (D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1912</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to maintain writ of forcible detainer the relation of landlord and tenant must exist in some form. Cuyler v. Estis, 64 S.W. 673, 23 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1063</cite> (1901). See Alexander v. Gardner, 123 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 552</cite>, 96 S.W. 818, 29 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 958</cite>, 1906 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where lessee of distillery failed to pay the state and county tax at the time they became due this operated ipso facto to terminate his lease and his landlord was entitled to resort to the writ of forcible detainer to regain possession of his premises. Walker v. Dowling, 68 S.W. 135, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 179</cite> (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where lease specified five (5) year term, but provided that if lessee shall fail to clear, fence and cultivate land by certain date he shall forfeit all claim thereunder, no written notice or demand was necessary to bring action for forcible detainer.

        Where a lease expired by its own limitation, no written demand from landlord for possession was necessary in order to bring an action for forcible detainer. Andrews v. Erwin, 78 S.W. 902, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 278</cite> (Ky. 1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff first brought forcible entry action upon which verdict of not guilty was returned and then brought forcible detainer action, lower court did not err in excluding verdict and judgment of first action in second action. Johnson v. Gordon, 118 S.W. 372 (Ky. 1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        If possessor’s entry was forcible, having been made upon the possession of a tenant for a term, the landlord, after expiration of the term, upon demand and refusal, may maintain forcible detainer proceedings against such occupant. American Coal Land Co. v. Miller, 182 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 51</cite>, 206 S.W. 18, 1918 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 313</cite> (Ky. 1918).

       <p>
        Mortgagee was not required to secure a writ of possession in foreclosure suit where mortgagor agreed to surrender possession on stated dates and mortgagee suffered him to live on premises until those dates, since after mortgagee purchased the premises at foreclosure sale the relationship of landlord and tenant existed and consequently forcible detainer was the proper proceeding to obtain possession of the premises. Pemberton v. Hardin, 258 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 538</cite>, 80 S.W.2d 589, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 204</cite> (Ky. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule requiring plaintiff to have actual possession of property in order to maintain forcible detainer does not apply where landlord seeks to evict tenant. Pemberton v. Hardin, 258 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 538</cite>, 80 S.W.2d 589, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 204</cite> (Ky. 1935).

       <p>
        Subdivision (3)(a) of this section would not provide the basis for a forcible detainer action against the former owner of certain property who remained on the property after its sale unless the court determined as a matter of law that the former owner was a tenant at sufferance. Emmons v. Madden, 781 S.W.2d 529, 1989 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 155</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred by entering a judgment of forcible detainer against the tenant, thereby ordering the tenant to vacate a gas station and convenience store which it had leased from the landlord; the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, 15 U.S.C.S. §§ 2801-2806, preempted state forcible detainer statutes, at least as applied to petroleum franchise agreements, and it was therefore improper for the district court to evict the tenant under state law, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.200ol13a" target="_self">KRS 383.200(3)(a)</a></cite>, Wis. Stat. § 799.40(1). Zad, LLC v. Bulk Petroleum Corp., 368 S.W.3d 122, 2012 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 76</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in affirming an order of eviction because the executive director of the housing authority, in filing the forcible detainer complaint and appearing at the hearing, was not acting on her own behalf but rather in the interest of the housing authority; thus, the executive director was engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. Hornsby v. Hous. Auth. of Dry Ridge, 566 S.W.3d 587, 2018 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 306</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rules dictate what is and is not the unauthorized practice of law and the courts are required to follow them; a forcible detainer complaint is a pleading that must be filed and practiced by an attorney. Hornsby v. Hous. Auth. of Dry Ridge, 566 S.W.3d 587, 2018 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 306</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Some housing authorities authorize their executive directors to file and proceed with forcible detainer actions on behalf of the housing authority in the absence of a licensed attorney; trial courts, however, are not at liberty to circumvent or evade the rules and statutory provisions by turning a blind eye to the requirements for the sake of expedience. Hornsby v. Hous. Auth. of Dry Ridge, 566 S.W.3d 587, 2018 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 306</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).

        Circuit court erred in affirming the district court’s order finding a son guilty of forcible detainer because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case since the parties did not have a landlord-tenant relationship; the mother held a possessory interest in the property through a life estate, and the son owned the same property through a remainder Cole v.

       It is a court process that the district court clerk should prepare the warrant or summons in actions for forcible entry or detainer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-212</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In jurisdictions not covered by the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, no statutory or common-law requirement presently exists that would require the landlord to provide to the tenant, who has failed to pay his or her rent or has violated some other provision of the oral or written lease agreement, any notice prior to filing an action, pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.200" target="_self">KRS 383.200</a></cite> to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.285" target="_self">383.285,</a></cite> for forcible entry and detainer; of course, once the landlord files the action, the tenant would have to be served with a summons and a copy of the complaint. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-216</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the warrant described in this section is the document to be used to bring the defendant before the court in an eviction proceeding, regardless of whether or not the matter is to be tried by a jury, the warrant is judicial process; thus, the sheriff’s fee for executing the warrant by serving it on the defendant is ten dollars, pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.090" target="_blank">KRS 64.090</a></cite>, which uses the term for “executing and returning process” in designating a fee of ten dollars. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-333</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a jury is demanded in an eviction proceeding by either the plaintiff or defendant, pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the sheriff must be paid the additional fee of eight dollars for summoning and attending a jury in a case of forcible entry and detainer, besides fees for summoning witnesses, as prescribed by <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.090" target="_blank">KRS 64.090</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-333</cite>.

        Public interest exception to the mootness doctrine applied, and the court of appeals reviewed the merits of a tenant’s arguments, because both questions the tenant raised in the appeal, the notice requirements in forcible entry and detainer proceedings and the unauthorized practice of law in such proceedings, were questions of a public nature; there was need for additional guidance in future cases as to both questions, which were likely to recur in future forcible detainer cases.

        Circuit court erred in upholding the district court’s decision to deny a tenant’s motion to dismiss a forcible detainer complaint without addressing the merits of her argument because the notice requirement in a local rule had no application to forcible entry and detainer cases.

       <p>
        This section requires that the issual of the warrant of restitution, if the inquisition is in the favor of the plaintiff, must follow the failure of the unsuccessful party to file the traverse on or before the third day after the finding of the inquest. Swanson v. Smith, 117 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 116</cite>, 77 S.W. 700, 25 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1260</cite>, 1903 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 286</cite> (Ky. 1903).

       <p>
        Warrant, being fair on its face, protected the officer, but did not protect the persons who procured it to be issued before it was authorized by this section. Roettger v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where forcible detainer was tried on Friday and warrant of restitution was issued on Monday, the warrant was premature and lower court erred in directing verdict for landlord in action by tenant for damages sustained as a result of dispossession. Roettger v. Riefkin, 130 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 197</cite>, 113 S.W. 88, 1908 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 254</cite> (Ky. 1908).

        This section authorizes restitution for either forcible entry or forcible detainer. Newsom v. Damron, 302 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 79</cite>, 193 S.W.2d 643, 1946 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 594</cite> (Ky. 1946).

        When applied to an indigent person without sufficient funds to make the required payment into court, this section creates a financial barrier between him and the Circuit Court which forecloses his avenue of appeal; therefore, as to an indigent person, this section constitutes an unreasonable and, therefore, impermissible regulation of the exercise of the right of appeal secured by Const., § 115. Fickey v. Cross Creek Apartments, Ltd., 700 S.W.2d 807, 1985 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 697</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1985).

       <p>
        The purpose of this section is twofold; the traverse preserves the right of the traversor to a trial in Circuit Court, and the traverse bond protects the adverse party and secures indemnity to him, if he is ultimately successful. Mayhew v. Kentucky River Coal Corp., 238 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 509</cite>, 38 S.W.2d 452, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 283</cite> (Ky. 1931).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The sole and exclusive remedy of the party aggrieved by an adverse finding is to traverse the inquest and a new trial cannot be had. Swanson v. Smith, 117 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 116</cite>, 77 S.W. 700, 25 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1260</cite>, 1903 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 286</cite> (Ky. 1903). See Chapman v. Baker, 312 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 138</cite>, 226 S.W.2d 769, 1950 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 603</cite> (Ky. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Recitation of filing of traverse in bond was not sufficient. The authentic way to show filing of the traverse is to let the fact appear of record. Berry v. Trice, 179 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 594</cite>, 201 S.W. 37, 1918 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 275</cite> (Ky. 1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        In filing a traverse in a forcible detainer action defendant waived any objections to procedural errors relating to the original complaint or to the issuance or sufficiency of the warrant, where the defendant was given a trial de novo in Circuit Court and thus was not prejudiced by the alleged failure of the city court to serve a warrant prior to the initial proceeding. Mitchell v. Housing Authority of Harlan, 533 S.W.2d 217, 1976 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 110</cite> (Ky. 1976).

        Where an appellant filed a traverse and was granted a trial de novo, the filing of the traverse waived any objections to procedural errors relating to the original complaint or the issuance or sufficiency of the warrant in the initial proceeding. Mitchell v. Housing Authority of Harlan, 533 S.W.2d 217, 1976 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 110</cite> (Ky. 1976).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The filing of a traverse after the prescribed time has no effect in either staying the proceedings or giving jurisdiction to the Circuit Court, according to well established principles governing appeals. Ficke v. Covington Sav. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 193 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 792</cite>, 237 S.W. 662, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 79</cite> (Ky. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        The day of rendition of the judgment on the inquest is counted as the first of the three (3) days within which the traverse must be filed. Black v. National Bank of Kentucky, 226 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 152</cite>, 10 S.W.2d 629, 1928 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 45</cite> (Ky. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        The three (3) day limitation for filing a traverse means three (3) juridical days. Black v. National Bank of Kentucky, 226 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 152</cite>, 10 S.W.2d 629, 1928 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 45</cite> (Ky. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court erred in quashing traverse bond and suspending the stay of restitution where traverse was filed after inquest but before judgment was entered. Mayhew v. Kentucky River Coal Corp., 238 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 509</cite>, 38 S.W.2d 452, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 283</cite> (Ky. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure of the justice to indorse the time when traverse and bond was filed or presented to him for filing, if they were so presented, is not ground for dismissal. Citizens Coal Co. v. Foley, 278 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 573</cite>, 129 S.W.2d 131, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 469</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the justice is required to return the papers and proceedings to the Circuit Court upon filing of a traverse and bond within the requisite time, the action of the justice in making such return to the Circuit Court creates a prima facie presumption that the traverse and bond were filed before him within the requisite time and failure to indorse them as filed afforded no ground for dismissal. Hall's Ex'rs v. Robinson, 291 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 631</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 163, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 285</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Day of rendition of judgment must be counted as the first of three (3) days within which traverse must be filed and where judgment was rendered on 10th of month and traverse filed on 13th, the action must be dismissed. Avery v. Davenport, 300 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 865</cite>, 190 S.W.2d 663, 1945 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 672</cite> (Ky. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where traverse was filed on day after judgment but county judge did not enter filing on records of his court within three (3) days allowed, Circuit Court correctly overruled motion to dismiss appeal. Brock v. Ettin, 303 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 225</cite>, 197 S.W.2d 256, 1946 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 823</cite> (Ky. 1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions of this section are mandatory and jurisdictional, and traverse and bond not having been filed within required time, Circuit Court should have dismissed appeal, had proper motion been made. Allen v. Caldwell, 306 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 869</cite>, 209 S.W.2d 712, 1948 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 670</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        The day of the judgment must be counted as the first of the three (3) days allowed for filing the traverse. Royse v. Vigusin, 309 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 89</cite>, 216 S.W.2d 892, 1949 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 638</cite> (Ky. 1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule is that, in computing three (3) days within which the traverse must be filed, the day on which the verdict is rendered and the day on which the bond is executed must both be counted. Chapman v. Baker, 312 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 138</cite>, 226 S.W.2d 769, 1950 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 603</cite> (Ky. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sundays and legal holidays are not counted, since the three (3) days referred to in the law are three (3) juridical days. Chapman v. Baker, 312 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 138</cite>, 226 S.W.2d 769, 1950 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 603</cite> (Ky. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where traverse and traverse bond were left in the hands of person in charge of judge’s office within prescribed time and judge approved this bond and marked it filed on following day, there was a substantial meeting of the requirements of law relative to filing of traverse and traverse bond. Wilson v. Leftwich, 239 S.W.2d 474, 1951 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 896</cite> (Ky. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, within prescribed time, appellant left traverse and traverse bond in hands of person in charge of office of county judge, this was sufficient filing as to traverse since paper is filed when presented at proper office and left with person in charge thereof and fees for filing, if any, paid. Wilson v. Leftwich, 239 S.W.2d 474, 1951 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 896</cite> (Ky. 1951).

        Such damages as are the natural and proximate result of the forcible entry and detainer may be recovered from the traverser, and the reasonable value of the rents and profits of the land is an element which should be considered.

        Where entry occurred more than two years prior to issual of writ, the action was bared by this section. Agreement to arbitrate did not amount to surrender of possession and subsequent refusal to abide by decision of arbitrators did not, therefore, amount to a new forcible entry. Hord v. Sartain, 86 S.W. 692, 27 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 796</cite> (1905).

        Since more than two years had elapsed from the time when appellee entered upon property before forcible entry proceedings were instituted, judgment of lower court in peremptorily instructing jury to find for defendant was affirmed.

        Summary judgment for landlords in a tenant’s claim for personal injuries arising from the landlords’
    failure to repair carpet in a leased apartment was proper because the Uniform Residential Landlord Tenant Act, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.500" target="_self">KRS 383.500</a></cite> et seq., did not alter the common-law rule that a lessor’s liability for breach of an agreement to repair leased premises was limited to the cost of repair.

        Kentucky’s Uniform Residential Landlord Tenant Act (URLTA), <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.500" target="_self">KRS 383.500</a></cite> et seq., did not protect the landlords from liability for the tenant’s personal injuries that she allegedly sustained when a part of her ceiling collapsed, apparently as a result of water damage from a leaking roof, because the URLTA did not alter the common law rule that the landlords could be liable for defects in common areas of the premises over which the landlords retained exclusive control, including the roof and the area between the roof and the tenant’s ceiling. Warren v. Winkle, 400 S.W.3d 755, 2013 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 81</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).

        Unpublished decision:
    Court of appeals affirmed the district court’s judgment finding that women who were evicted from a shelter where they lived did not have a protected interest under the Kentucky Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (KURLTA) and could not recover damages from the officers in a suit they filed under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983. In reaching its decision, the court of appeals found that the shelter was an “institution” within the meaning of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.535ol11" target="_self">KRS 383.535(1)</a></cite> and was not subject to the KURLTA, and that, even if the shelter was subject to the KURLTA, the women who were evicted were not tenants under the KURLTA because they did not have a right to exclusive possession of bedrooms they were assigned by the shelter.

        Unpublished decision:
    Court of appeals affirmed the district court’s judgment finding that women who were evicted from a shelter where they lived did not have a protected interest under the Kentucky Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (KURLTA) and could not recover damages from the officers in a suit they filed under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983. In reaching its decision, the court of appeals found that the shelter was an “institution” within the meaning of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIc383s383.535ol11" target="_self">KRS 383.535(1)</a></cite> and was not subject to the KURLTA, and that, even if the shelter was subject to the KURLTA, the women who were evicted were not tenants under the KURLTA because they did not have a right to exclusive possession of bedrooms they were assigned by the shelter.

       All landlords of residential property requiring security deposits prior to occupancy shall be required to deposit all tenants’ security deposits in an account used only for that purpose, in any bank or other lending institution subject to regulation by the Commonwealth of Kentucky or any agency of the United States government. Prospective tenants shall be informed of the location of the separate account and the account number.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIc383s383.580ol12">
       Prior to tendering any consideration deemed to be a security deposit, the prospective tenant shall be presented with a comprehensive listing of any then-existing damage to the unit which would be the basis for a charge against the security deposit and the estimated dollar cost of repairing such damage. The tenant shall have the right to inspect the premises to ascertain the accuracy of such listing prior to taking occupancy. The landlord and the tenant shall sign the listing, which signatures shall be conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such listing, but shall not be construed to be conclusive to latent defects. If the tenant shall refuse to sign such listing, he shall state specifically in writing the items on the list to which he dissents, and shall sign such statement of dissent.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIc383s383.580ol13">
       At the termination of occupancy, the landlord shall inspect the premises and compile a comprehensive listing of any damage to the unit which is the basis for any charge against the security deposit and the estimated dollar cost of repairing such damage. The tenant shall then have the right to inspect the premises to ascertain the accuracy of such listing. The landlord and the tenant shall sign the listing, which signatures shall be conclusive evidence of the accuracy of such listing. If the tenant shall refuse to sign such listing, he shall state specifically in writing the items on the list to which he dissents, and shall sign such statement of dissent.

       No landlord shall be entitled to retain any portion of a security deposit if the security deposit was not deposited in a separate account as required by subsection (1) of this section and if the initial and final damage listings required by subsections (2) and (3) of this section are not provided.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIc383s383.580ol15">
       A tenant who disputes the accuracy of the final damage listing given pursuant to subsection (3) of this section may bring an action in District Court. Tenant’s claim shall be limited to those items from which the tenant specifically dissented in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, or except as otherwise provided, and if the tenant shall fail to sign the listing or specifically dissent in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, the tenant shall not be entitled to recover any damages under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIc383s383.580ol16">
       In the event a tenant leaves not paying his last month’s rent and does not demand a return of his deposit, the landlord may, after thirty (30) days, remove the deposit from the account and apply any such excess to the debt owing.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIc383s383.580ol17">
       In the event the tenant leaves not owing rent and having any refund due, the landlord shall send notification to the last known or reasonably determinable address, of the amount of any refund due the tenant. In the event the landlord shall not have received a response from the tenant within sixty (60) days from the sending of such notification, the landlord may remove the deposit from the account and retain it free from any claim of the tenant or any person claiming in his behalf.

       In dealing with custodial property, a custodian shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person, dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other statute restricting investments by fiduciaries. If a custodian has a special skill or expertise or is named custodian on the basis of representations of a special skill or expertise, the custodian shall use that skill or expertise. However, a custodian, in the custodian’s discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor’s estate, may retain any custodial property received from a transferor.

Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest is so identified if the minor’s interest is held as a tenant in common and is fixed. Custodial property subject to recordation is so identified if it is recorded, and custodial property subject to registration is so identified if it is either registered, or held in an account designated, in the name of the custodian, followed in substance by the words: “as a custodian for — (name of minor) under the Kentucky Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.”
