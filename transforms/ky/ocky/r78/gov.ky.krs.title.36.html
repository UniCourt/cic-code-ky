        Before any matter of provocation can be introduced in evidence, it must be pleaded, and the right to plead it is limited to mitigation of punitive damages. Barth v.

        Evidence of previous overtures to defendant’s wife was admissible in mitigation of punitive damages for assault and battery. Hamilton v.

       <p>
        In action for assault and battery and false arrest, defendant’s testimony that unidentified persons had shot pistols and shotguns near his home; that the roof of his barn had been damaged by bullets; that a lock on his barn had been shot off; that property had been stolen from his barn and from his storehouse; that one of his gates had been carried away; and that his watering trough had been destroyed were all admissible under the peculiar facts of the case, although plaintiffs were not identified as the perpetrators of the acts, for said acts might have had some bearing upon defendant’s state of mind at the time of the shooting and could have been construed by the jury as offering some justification for his conduct. Alexander v. Jones, 249 S.W.2d 35, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 788</cite> (Ky. 1952).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where there is a plea and proof of provocation, the court should instruct the jury to consider proof heard in support of plea by way of mitigation of punitive damages. Louisville R. Co. v. Frick, 158<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 450</cite>, 165 S.W. 649, 1914<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 640</cite> (Ky. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Error, if any, arising from failure of court to define the words “wilfully and maliciously,” in an instruction to the jury on punitive damages, was not prejudicial, where award was modest and not in excess of a reasonable allowance for compensatory damages alone and the evidence showed the assault was willful and not without malice. Herring v. Lunderman, 302<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271" target="_blank">Ky. 271</a></cite>, 194 S.W.2d 506, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 650</cite> (Ky. 1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for assault, an instruction offered under this section to the effect that the law was for the defendant if the jury believed from the evidence that the conduct of the plaintiff was such as to excuse an ordinarily prudent man in making the assault was properly refused for failing to limit its application to mitigation of punitive damages and for failure to plead provocation as provided by this section. Herring v. Lunderman, 302<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271" target="_blank">Ky. 271</a></cite>, 194 S.W.2d 506, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 650</cite> (Ky. 1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute does not require the trial court to instruct the jury on punitive damages in any civil action seeking recovery for assault and battery; the statute merely permits a defendant to introduce evidence of provocation in mitigation of a claim for punitive damages. Banks v. Fritsch, 39 S.W.3d 474, 2001<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 22</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2001).

        By this section the seduction act is made the cause of action, and not loss of service or expense. Kelly v.

        The word “seduction,” when applied to the conduct of a man towards a woman, means the use of some influence, artifice, promise or means on his part by which he induces the woman who is then, and has theretofore for a reasonable time been, a woman of chaste conduct to submit to unlawful intercourse with him. Stowers v. Singer, 113<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 584</cite>, 68 S.W. 637, 24<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 395</cite>, 1902<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 83</cite> (Ky. 1902).

       <p>
        Female could not sue for her seduction. The law gave the right of action to those only who could sue at common law. Its object was to dispense allegation and proof of loss of service. Woodward v. Anderson, 72<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 624</cite>, 1873<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 14</cite> (Ky. 1873). See Cline &amp; Co. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        This section being silent on the question as to who may bring an action for seduction, the common-law rule upon this question is therefore in full force, and the relation of master and servant, or parent and child, must still appear in the pleading. Taylor v. Daniel, 98 S.W. 986, 30<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 377</cite>, 1907<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 382</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1907).

       <p>
        This section did not repeal the common-law remedy but gives the parent a right of action for daughter’s seduction, and his resulting loss of service, without allegation or proof of loss of service. Monahan v. Clemons, 212<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc504" target="_blank">Ky. 504</a></cite>, 279 S.W. 974, 1926<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 185</cite> (Ky. 1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Slight evidence of loss of service is all that is required in action at common law and no loss of service is required under this section. Kelly v. Combs, 229<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc502" target="_blank">Ky. 502</a></cite>, 17 S.W.2d 435, 1929<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 792</cite> (Ky. 1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        An action for seduction brought under this section does not require any proof of loss of services of the female but, in an action brought under the common law, it is necessary for plaintiff to establish some right to the services of the one seduced and to allege and prove the loss of her services, although slight evidence of loss of services is all that is required and proof of emancipation, if alleged and proved, is a defense. Collis v. Hoskins, 306<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.34.html#tXXXIVc391" target="_blank">Ky. 391</a></cite>, 208 S.W.2d 70, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        An instruction that if the jury believes that defendant seduced, debauched, and carnally knew plaintiff’s daughter and that by reason or means of such seduction and carnal knowledge of defendant of said daughter, said daughter became pregnant and they should find for plaintiff is not sufficient.

       <p>
        In common-law action for seduction, defense that daughter was emancipated must be specifically pleaded. Collis v.

        Proof of emancipation, if alleged and proved, is an affirmative defense to an action for seduction brought under the common law. Collis v.

        It is actionable under this section to impute a want of chastity to a female without allegation or proof of special damage and it is not necessary that the words make the charge in express terms. Williams v. Riddle, 145<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 459</cite>, 140 S.W. 661, 1911<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 882</cite> (Ky. 1911). See Martin v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Were it not for this law, a charge of fornication against a female would not be actionable per se. Hickerson v. Masters, 190<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc168" target="_blank">Ky. 168</a></cite>, 226 S.W. 1072, 1921<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 405</cite> (Ky. 1921).

        To be slanderous per se under this section, the words uttered must clearly and unequivocally import the charge alleged. Bishop v.

       <p>
        The words “Has one of N’s girls had a young one? I heard it” made a charge of fornication and are therefore actionable per se. Nicholson v. Merritt, 109<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc369" target="_blank">Ky. 369</a></cite>, 59 S.W. 25, 22<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        “You often went to Dr. Duvall’s office, pulled the blinds down and locked the door, and stayed for hours, and got the medicine you went for. You are a bitch and I can prove it” was sufficient to prefer a charge of unchastity and adulterous conduct, independent of the innuendo. Martin v. White, 188<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.12.html#tXIIc153" target="_blank">Ky. 153</a></cite>, 221 S.W. 528, 1920<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 248</cite> (Ky. 1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        Words accusing a woman of being a whore are actionable per se, as they accuse her of fornication or adultery. Justice v. Wellman, 260<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 479</cite>, 86 S.W.2d 132, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 488</cite> (Ky. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        A statement by landlord to woman tenant in the presence of third parties that the police were making him get rid of all lewd women and that she had to move was actionable per se. Vanover v. Wells, 264<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 461</cite>, 94 S.W.2d 999, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 335</cite> (Ky. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action of slander by a female where the alleged slanderous language was “She (plaintiff) is going to have a baby, she is in a family way,” it was essential to plaintiff’s cause of action that her petition expressly set out that she was a single woman, since such an accusation concerning a married woman would not impute a want of chastity. Parks v. Berry, 307<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc21" target="_blank">Ky. 21</a></cite>, 209 S.W.2d 726, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 675</cite> (Ky. 1948).

        Presumption of singleness which arose from statement that plaintiff was under 16 years of age did not cure fatal error in petition of failure to allege that plaintiff was unmarried. Parks v.

       <p>
        The words “She is a dirty bitch; she has no character, and is no account” could not be extended beyond their natural meaning by innuendo and are not actionable words in themselves importing that she was a whore, common prostitute or was guilty of fornication or adultery. Craig v. Pyles, 101<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 593</cite>, 39 S.W. 33, 18<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1043</cite>, 1897<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 141</cite> (Ky. 1897).

       <p>
        The use of the words “She is a damned slut, she is a damned bitch, she is a damned sow and those who know her know that she is no account” could not be extended by innuendo to mean that the person about whom they were spoken was an improper, indecent, and unchaste character who indulged in vile and improper practices and that she was not worthy of association of the people, and were not actionable. Peters v. Barth, 50 S.W. 682, 20<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1934</cite> (1899).

        Averment that defendant had no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief that he ever spoke the words of and concerning the plaintiff, “I discharged E for stealing,” and had no recollection of speaking the words, and therefore denies he ever spoke such words, is not a denial of the charge made.

        Where defendant, by his answer, admitted that he spoke the words charged but averred they were spoken to his wife in the privacy of his family and were accidentally overheard by another person in the house not known to be within hearing and thus, without having been so intended by him, became public and, in reply, the plaintiff averred that it was not true that the defendant spoke the words complained of under the circumstances stated in the answer and also averred that the defendant had often spoken the words, or the substance of them, in the presence of divers persons, the court held that the plaintiff had no right to recover for any other publication than that admitted in the answer.

        In action for libel charging appellee with acting corruptly as a juror and perjuring himself wherein the defendants pleaded the truth of the accusation in justification and, by way of mitigation, also relied upon general rumor that the appellant would act as charged and that defendants had good reasons for their belief that the publication was true, the court held: (1) where the truth of the words was pleaded in justification, it was a complete defense to a civil action for libel and the burden of the issue was upon the defendants; (2) the object of offering matters in mitigation was, as the very name implied, to mitigate the damages that might be recovered and therefore, where recovery was denied, plaintiff was not prejudiced by evidence of any circumstances in mitigation; and (3) the jury having found the publication was in fact true, it was entirely immaterial whether the appellees were or were not actuated by malice, and testimony to that effect was not prejudicial to appellant.

        Where publication was admitted and defendant pleaded the truth of the same but utterly failed to sustain the truth, he was guilty of libel and the mere fact that he may have believed that the statements or charges made were true was no defense.

        Ordinarily, the truth of an alleged libel must be pleaded as a defense, but that rule can only apply when there is a necessity for such a plea and, if the petition shows that to be true which would be a good defense on plea, the latter becomes unnecessary and a demurrer exposes the infirmity of the petition. Rollins v. Louisville Times Co., 139<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 788</cite>, 90 S.W. 1081, 28<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1054</cite>, 1906<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 5</cite> (Ky.

        The rule that the truth of an alleged libel must be pleaded as a defense did not apply and a demurrer reached the defect where the petition alleged that the statement that plaintiff had “left the county and his friends were unable to locate him” was false but, as amended, showed a number of his friends knew his whereabouts and that he had been summoned by the sheriff to appear as a witness in another county and that he returned home the day after the article was published, since the petition showed on its face that he had left the county and that some of his friends did not know where he was.

        Defendant by his plea admitted that he spoke the words alleged except that he did not use the word “dishonestly” and pleaded that the words spoken by him were spoken in confidence and were a privileged communication and, being required to elect whether he would stand by his denial of having charged the plaintiff with taking the goods “dishonestly” or upon his plea of privileged communication, under protest, elected to stand upon the latter defense. The court in its instruction said to the jury that it was admitted by the pleadings that the defendant had spoken the words alleged in the petition, which included the word “dishonestly.” The court held that this was error and prejudicial to the defendant.

        In an action for libel, pleading and proof of the truth of the written statements is always a complete defense, although the publication may be inspired by malice or ill will and be libelous per se.

        It is no justification for a repetition of the slander that it had been reported in the neighborhood or that appellant, at the time he communicated the slander, gave the party to whom he related it the name of the person from whom he learned said report or that he informed him at the time that he did not believe said report to be true, and it cannot be relied on by way of justification that he did not intend to charge appellant with the offense of fornication. It was, however, competent under this action to have inquired of all witnesses whether or not the report spoken of was generally known in the neighborhood, but there the inquiry should have ceased. It was also competent for appellee to prove the fact that he had stated he did not believe the report and that he gave the name of his author and any other mitigating circumstances for the purpose of rebutting actual malice and to escape the infliction of punitive damages.

        This section, which permits the pleading of mitigating circumstances in connection with a plea of the truth of the alleged slander, does not seem to have changed the common-law rule, and the mitigating circumstances might properly be introduced in evidence under the general issue without a plea setting them forth.

        Since it is well settled in this state that although it is no justification to say that defendant merely repeated what he had heard, it is competent for the defendant, in an action of this character, to show in mitigation of damages that the rumor was generally known in the neighborhood, although he will not be permitted to show, in detail, conversations had with different persons with regard to the alleged rumor. Provision of this section which permits the pleading of mitigating circumstances in connection with a plea of the truth of the alleged libel or slander does not seem to have changed the common-law rule that such testimony might have been introduced under the general issue; therefore, such mitigating circumstances might properly be shown without a plea setting them forth.

        Kentucky has adopted the view that defamatory communication may consist of a statement in the form of an opinion, but a statement of this nature is actionable only if it implies the allegation of undisclosed defamatory facts as the basis of the opinion. In the case at bar, the evidence at trial, in which the book was scrutinized in detail, showed that defendant arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff had committed adultery on the basis of rumor and circumstantial evidence which was persuasive to her; the facts on which she based the conclusion were disclosed in the book. Therefore, the action for defamation must fail. Lassiter v. Lassiter, 456 F. Supp. 2d 876, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70286 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2006</cite>), aff'd, 280 Fed.

        In action for slander by appellee against appellant for accusing her of the crime of perjury in testifying to which appellant set up the defenses of not guilty and of justification, action of lower court in requiring defendant to elect was held erroneous in view of law which permitted defendant to set forth in his answer as many grounds of defense, counterclaim, and setoff, whether legal or equitable, as he had.

        Where a newspaper article erroneously stated that an older boy pounded the victim’s head against the pavement, and that he was “beaten into insensibility,” no extrinsic facts were needed to show that the statement was defamatory, for friends and acquaintances who were familiar with the incident were certain to recognize the unnamed perpetrator of the offense; therefore, the article was libelous per se.

        Defendant’s attempt to verify his story and his readiness to write another article giving the defamed person’s side of the story are not examples of reckless disregard for the truth, nor do they indicate that defendant knew the story was false, and while defendant’s reporting may not have met the proper standards for a journalist, his reporting was not so reckless as to be malicious; thus the trial court should have directed a verdict for defendant on the issue of punitive damages.

        The publication of a libel exposed the publisher not only to compensatory damages for the loss of business but also to a judgment for the mental suffering that the libel or slander inflicted upon the plaintiff; if the publication was malicious or made in reckless disregard of the rights of the plaintiff, the defendant was also liable for punitive damages.

        Court denied a newspaper owner’s motion to dismiss a physician’s claim for punitive damages in a defamation action because the available evidence regarding the conspicuousness of the publication of the physician’s demand letter was not so persuasive as to require the conclusion that the publication was conspicuous within the meaning of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.051ol14" target="_self">411.051(4)</a></cite>. A reasonable jury could determine that the publication was not substantially as conspicuous as the original articles. Trover v. Kluger, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21585 (W.D. Ky. Sept. 26, 2005).

        Since plaintiff, in an action for defamation, invasion of privacy and outrageous conduct as a result of an allegedly untrue and insulting newspaper article published by defendants, failed to make a written demand for correction prior to filing her defamation claim as required by subsection (1) of this section, she was not entitled to punitive damages on that claim.

        Because the torts of defamation and false light invasion of privacy are so closely related, courts have held that the procedural requirements applicable to one of these causes of action are applicable to the other as well; accordingly, plaintiff’s failure to submit a written demand for retraction prior to initiating this action, as required by this section, bars her demand for punitive damages on both her defamation and false light claims.

       <p>
        The question of whether an article impartially and fairly stated the situation and plaintiff’s part in it should have been submitted to the jury for determination where different conclusions could have been drawn, and trial court erred in dismissing complaint on ground the allegedly libelous publication was privileged. Kremer v. Kopmeyer, 418 S.W.2d 237, 1967<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 205</cite> (Ky. 1967).

        Newspaper publisher was entitled to summary judgment on a physician’s claim of false-light invasion of privacy, which arose from the publication of articles that reported on a medical center’s investigation into the physician’s work as a radiologist, because the articles were accurate accounts where the court previously held that the newspaper was shielded from defamation liability for the articles at issue under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.060" target="_self">411.060</a></cite>.

        The issue of malice in publication was for the jury, since the great weight of authority supports the view that the motive by which defendant was activated must be determined by the triers of the fact whenever the evidence raises the issue. Kremer v. Kopmeyer, 418 S.W.2d 237, 1967<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 205</cite> (Ky. 1967).

        As used in this section, the phrase “maliciously made,” with respect to defamatory publications, means a statement made solely for the purpose of causing harm to the person defamed. Pearce v.

    Certain statements in an affidavit made preparatory to the filing of a petition to set aside a judgment on the ground of fraud were libelous per se unless they were privileged, and they were privileged if they were material and pertinent to the cause, regardless of whether the statements were made maliciously or in good faith.

        Dismissal of a libel complaint filed against a newspaper was proper because the term “carjacking” was a fair and accurate description of the alleged facts giving rise to an accused’s criminal charges; moreover, the newspaper article was absolutely privileged under
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.060" target="_self">411.060</a></cite>. The accused’s complaint was devoid of any allegation of maliciousness, and he did not request an explanation or contradiction concerning the article. Akins v. News Enter., 2011 Ky. App. Unpub.

     Actions against a radio or television broadcasting station for damages for publication of a defamatory statement — Definitions.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="tXXXVIc411s411.061ol11">
       <span class="boldspan">
       </span>
       In any action against a radio or television broadcasting station for damages for the publication of a defamatory statement by a visual or sound radio broadcast, the plaintiff shall recover no more than special damages unless he shall allege and prove that he made a sufficient demand for correction and that the radio or television broadcasting station failed to make conspicuous and timely publication of said correction.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXVIc411s411.061ol12">
       <span class="boldspan">
       </span>
       A “sufficient demand for correction” is a demand for correction which is in writing; which is signed by the plaintiff or his duly authorized attorney or agent; which specifies the statement or statements claimed to be false and defamatory, states wherein they are false, and sets forth the true facts; and which is delivered to the defendant prior to the commencement of the action.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXVIc411s411.061ol13">
       <span class="boldspan">
       </span>
       A “correction” is either (a) the publication of an acknowledgment that the statement or statements specified as false and defamatory in the plaintiff’s demand for correction are erroneous, or (b) the publication of the plaintiff’s statement of the true facts (as set forth in his demand for correction) or a fair summary thereof, exclusive of any portions thereof which are defamatory of another, obscene, or otherwise improper for publication. If the demand for correction has specified two (2) or more statements as false and defamatory, the correction may deal with some of such statements pursuant to (a) above and with other of such statements pursuant to (b) above.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXVIc411s411.061ol14">
       <span class="boldspan">
       </span>
       A “conspicuous publication” in a visual or sound radio broadcast is a publication which is broadcast at substantially the same time of day, and with the same sending power, as the statement or statements specified as false and defamatory in the demand for correction. A publication in a particular manner which is agreeable to the plaintiff shall in any event be deemed “conspicuous.”
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXVIc411s411.061ol15">
       <span class="boldspan">
       </span>
       A “timely publication” in a visual or sound radio broadcast is a publication within one (1) business day after the day on which a sufficient demand for correction is received by the defendant. A “business day” is any day other than a Sunday or legal holiday. A publication on a particular day which is agreeable to the plaintiff shall in any event be deemed “timely.”

      <li id="tXXXVIc411s411.061ol16">
       <span class="boldspan">
       </span>
       “Special damages” are pecuniary damages which the plaintiff alleges and proves that he has suffered in respect to his property, business, trade, profession, or occupation (including such amounts of money as the plaintiff alleges and proves he has expended as a proximate result of the alleged defamation), and no other.

      If property is distrained or attached without good cause the owner may, in an action against the party suing out the distress or attachment, recover damages for the wrongful seizure. If the property is sold he may also recover damages for the sale, and the defendant’s costs in the distress or attachment, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The plaintiff shall not be required to allege or prove malice on the part of the defendant under this section.

        In action for wrongful attachment of well-drilling machinery and equipment, proof that sheriff went to premises on which owners were drilling a well for landowner, levied upon the machine, and took constructive possession was sufficient to establish that an attachment was made as against contention of defendants that there was never any attachment because sheriff did not physically remove the machine from the premises.

        That property was wrongfully attached is concluded by the judgment discharging the attachment, and the property owner’s right to maintain an action directly against those who wrongfully caused the attachment to be issued and levied upon his property, instead of suing upon the attachment bond, is specifically conferred by this section. Crawford v. Staples, 184<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 477</cite>, 212 S.W. 119, 1919<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 81</cite> (Ky. 1919).

       <p>
        In suit for recovery of damages based upon attachment bond executed to obtain order of attachment, discharge of the attachment on the merits is conclusive that it was issued without probable cause. Watkins v. Carter, 267<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.20.html#tXXc241" target="_blank">Ky. 241</a></cite>, 101 S.W.2d 932, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 300</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action under this section, the fundamental issue is whether or not the property was attached without good cause, and the plaintiff is not required to allege or prove malice. City Lumber Co. v. Barrett, 327 S.W.2d 402, 1959<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 74</cite> (Ky. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been recognized that an attachment suit is wrongful if the defendant is not indebted to the plaintiff and, if there is some question on this, it is a matter for the jury. City Lumber Co. v. Barrett, 327 S.W.2d 402, 1959<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 74</cite> (Ky. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The obvious purpose of agreed order appointing receiver in the original suit was to permit the continuation of timber operations which the company’s attachment had held up and was in no sense an acknowledgment or judicial admission of debtor of his indebtedness and a justification of the attachment. City Lumber Co. v. Barrett, 327 S.W.2d 402, 1959<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 74</cite> (Ky. 1959).

        Advice of counsel obtained by company after suit was filed where full and true disclosure was questioned was not a defense to timber operator’s subsequent suit against company for damages for wrongful attachment.

        A suit to set aside a conveyance as fraudulent creates a lis pendens lien on the property sought to be thus subjected without any attachment, or any indorsement on the summons of the object of the action, and as the attachment in such suit does not cause the damage, no damages can be recovered for its levy. Caldwell v. Deposit Bank, 109<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc197" target="_blank">Ky. 197</a></cite>, 58 S.W. 589, 22<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

       </p>
       <p>
        As to such property as is owned and held for use, the criterion of damages for the loss of the use is the value of such use, but where the property is not owned and held by the owner for use but for sale, the value of the loss of possession, not being capable of estimation on a basis of its usable value, as it has no such value to the owner, is estimated on the basis of the deterioration or depreciation in its salable value caused by the attachment. Crawford v. Staples, 184<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 477</cite>, 212 S.W. 119, 1919<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 81</cite> (Ky. 1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        The measure of damages for the loss of use of property used by owners in their business while held under an attachment unlawfully obtained was the value of the use of property during the time owners were deprived of possession. Watkins v. Carter, 267<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.20.html#tXXc241" target="_blank">Ky. 241</a></cite>, 101 S.W.2d 932, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 300</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that the seller, under a conditional sales contract, retained title to the car certainly was not inconsistent with nor denied the plaintiff, in an action for wrongful attachment, the right to the use and possession of the car which he had acquired under the contract, and he could not recover damages for loss of use and possession prior to the time the car was wrongfully attached without default in payment. Watkins v. Carter, 267<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.20.html#tXXc241" target="_blank">Ky. 241</a></cite>, 101 S.W.2d 932, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 300</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action against sureties on attachment bond for damages resulting from loss of use of well-drilling machine during period of alleged wrongful attachment, it was not necessary for plaintiff to show that he could have operated the machine at a profit. Osborne v. Durbin, 301<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc412" target="_self">Ky. 412</a></cite>, 192 S.W.2d 198, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 497</cite> (Ky. 1946).

        The damages recoverable for the wrongful seizure of the property under an attachment by direction of plaintiff therein, where no attachment was sought against the persons whose property was seized, do not include attorney’s fees but only the actual and direct damages to the property itself. Farmers' &amp; Shippers' Tobacco Warehouse Co. v. Gibbons, 107<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 611</cite>, 55 S.W. 2, 21<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1348</cite>, 1900<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Where no attachment was sought against a person or his property but his name was inserted in the copies of the attachment by error, he could not maintain an action for the wrongful suing out of the attachment; his cause of action was an action for damages for the wrongful seizure of his property by attachment at the direction of the plaintiff in the attachment. Farmers' &amp; Shippers' Tobacco Warehouse Co. v. Gibbons, 107<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 611</cite>, 55 S.W. 2, 21<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1348</cite>, 1900<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Intervening claimants, in an action between the attachment defendant and the plaintiff who were finally on appeal adjudged owners of the property, could sue the attachment plaintiff for damages and they were not concerned with whether he had grounds for the attachment or acted without probable cause but the basis of their action was that the property was seized by the sheriff at the insistence of plaintiff and kept for a period of nine months; the question of ownership rested on the final judgment on appeal and not the judgment in trial court which was reversed on appeal. Eureka Dry Cleaners v. Stone Bros. &amp; Shrout, 261<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc15" target="_blank">Ky. 15</a></cite>, 86 S.W.2d 1032, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Where property of third person is seized and taken from its true owner by unlawful attachment, there can be no recovery of counsel fees and expenses incurred in establishing ownership of the property; the measure of damages where the property is used by the owners is the value of the use of the property during the time they were deprived of its possession. Eureka Dry Cleaners v. Stone Bros. &amp; Shrout, 261<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc15" target="_blank">Ky. 15</a></cite>, 86 S.W.2d 1032, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        If attachment suit terminated in favor of the attachment plaintiff and the judgment was not void, the fact that the attachment suit was brought with malicious intent did not give cause of action for maliciously prosecuting an attachment. Union Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Edwards, 281<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 693</cite>, 137 S.W.2d 344, 1940<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 98</cite> (Ky. 1940).

        To sustain an action for malicious attachment, the plaintiff must show that the attachment action terminated favorably to him, since otherwise it was brought with probable cause.

        Where attachment affidavit did not contain allegation that claim was just, the attachment issued thereon was not void but voidable and could not be attacked collaterally in suit for malicious attachment.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant in attachment suit alleged to have been maliciously brought did not in any way directly attack the validity of the proceeding, he could not attack it collaterally in an action for maliciously prosecuting an attachment unless the attachment was void and not merely voidable. Union Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Edwards, 281<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 693</cite>, 137 S.W.2d 344, 1940<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 98</cite> (Ky. 1940).

       <p>
        In action for malicious prosecution, evidence was not sufficient to establish that as a natural and proximate result of the closing of the store for a ten-day period, there would be continued loss of profits for such period extending into the future as to warrant substantial award of damages based on long-term loss for the wrongful attachment. Blankenship v. Staton, 348 S.W.2d 925, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 45</cite> (Ky. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        In applying the rule that before a party has a cause of action for malicious prosecution the lawsuit or proceeding must terminate in his favor, defendants had a proper adjudicated basis on which to rest their claim where plaintiff maliciously prosecuted an indemnity proceeding under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.39.html#tXXXIXc425s425.375" target="_blank">425.375</a></cite> (now repealed) and wrongfully obtained an attachment, which proceeding terminated favorably to defendants when the court discharged the attachment; the fact that plaintiff sued on notes on an action which accrued after the attachment proceedings and recovered judgment on the notes was not an issue.

       </p>
       <p>
        Only such damages were recoverable as were the natural and proximate result of wrongful act of attachment. Blankenship v. Staton, 348 S.W.2d 925, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 45</cite> (Ky. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remote, conjectural or speculative damages may not be recovered in counterclaim for malicious prosecution. Blankenship v. Staton, 348 S.W.2d 925, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 45</cite> (Ky. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since want of probable cause and actual malice must be shown to recover for malicious prosecution, advice of counsel, given upon full disclosure of facts, constitutes a defense. Blankenship v. Staton, 348 S.W.2d 925, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 45</cite> (Ky. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The award of $20,000 for the combined items of damages (loss of profits, loss of reputation and standing, humiliation, embarrassment and mental suffering) resulting from wrongful attachment was so excessive as to have been the result of passion and prejudice and the entire verdict should be set aside and a new trial granted on the question of damages. Blankenship v. Staton, 348 S.W.2d 925, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 45</cite> (Ky. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of a party to assert a common-law cause of action for malicious prosecution based upon wrongful attachment is specifically recognized and the remedy is available even though the complaining party could have sued on attachment bond or under this section. Blankenship v. Staton, 348 S.W.2d 925, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 45</cite> (Ky. 1961).

        The citizen who comes within the shield of this statute has a right to depend on the city for the protection of his property, and under this statute, if the city fails in its duty, its liability is not diminished by the failure of the citizens to have it guarded since the statute, subject to specified conditions, imposes upon the city a liability, and this liability it can escape only by performing its duty as described in the statute.

        The private citizen who owns property in a city may of course employ guards and resort to other lawful methods to protect his property, if he desires to do so, but his failure to do this, although he may have reason to anticipate its destruction by a mob, will not excuse the city from its duty to protect the property of its citizens from injury or destruction.

        This section does not purport to prescribe a period of limitation within which suit must be brought but merely requires the giving of notice as a prerequisite to the right to sue and thus does not violate constitutional prohibitions against class or special legislation.

        The purposes of the statute are to give the city an opportunity to investigate the scene of an accident and correct any defective condition, if such exists, to enable the city to investigate and evaluate the case so that if liability exists it might have an opportunity to settle it without long and expensive litigation, and to give the city an opportunity to protect its funds against unjust and illegal claims.

        Branch of tree overhanging city street, which dislodged body of a passing truck with resulting injury to a pedestrian, was a “defect” in the street within the meaning of this section. Galloway v. Winchester, 299<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc87" target="_blank">Ky. 87</a></cite>, 184 S.W.2d 890, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        The word “defect,” as used in this section, includes any defect, whether overhead or underfoot, which it is the duty of the city to correct to render the street in a reasonably safe condition for travel by the public.

        Giving oral notice of accident to mayor was not sufficient, even though mayor caused claimant to be examined by physicians and expressed opinion that claimant should be compensated by the city. Ballinger v. Harlan, 294<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc72" target="_blank">Ky. 72</a></cite>, 170 S.W.2d 912, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 381</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute, while not expressly saying so, clearly provides for a written notice. Irvine v. Cox, 296<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 680</cite>, 178 S.W.2d 199, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 609</cite> (Ky. 1944).

        Failure to give notice as required by this section applies to tort actions against cities. Louisville v.

       </p>
       <p>
        One of the purposes of the notice required by this section is to permit the city to investigate the cause of the accident, and to determine the condition of the defect claimed at the time of the accident. Galloway v. Winchester, 299<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc87" target="_blank">Ky. 87</a></cite>, 184 S.W.2d 890, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of giving the notice required by this section applies to all persons irrespective of age or disability and is not suspended during the infancy of a claimant. Galloway v. Winchester, 299<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc87" target="_blank">Ky. 87</a></cite>, 184 S.W.2d 890, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 388</cite> (Ky. 1945).

        Notice required by this section is jurisdictional and failure to give it is fatal. Broaddus v. Cox, 300<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc501" target="_blank">Ky. 501</a></cite>, 189 S.W.2d 726, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 586</cite> (Ky. 1945).

       <p>
        Giving of notice under this section is not a prerequisite to the bringing of an action for wrongful death by personal representative of person killed as a result of alleged defect in street. Spangler's Adm'r v. Middlesboro, 301<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.19.html#tXIXc237" target="_blank">Ky. 237</a></cite>, 191 S.W.2d 414, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        The city’s actual or constructive notice of defect in thoroughfare is not a substitute for notice. Berry v. Louisville, 249 S.W.2d 818, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 882</cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of notice is “to give the city an opportunity to investigate the cause of the accident and to determine the condition of the defect complained of, at or about the time of the accident, as well as to permit an examination of the injuries alleged to have been sustained by the claimant.” Berry v. Louisville, 249 S.W.2d 818, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 882</cite> (Ky. 1952).

        An action could not be maintained against a city for an injury growing out of a condition in a public sidewalk—a loose lid or top on a city-owned water meter box—when notice of the injury was not served on the city within 90 days of the occurrence of the injury in accordance with this section, since the water meter box was located in the sidewalk and the statute specifically covers defects in the sidewalk and does not exclude defects in a sidewalk of any kind whether of proprietary or governmental origin. Hancock v. Anchorage, 299 S.W.2d 794, 1957<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 426</cite> (Ky. 1957). See City of Elizabethtown v. Baker, 373 S.W.2d 593, 1963<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        The notice required by this section relates to actions against the city and is not required in an action against a municipal water and electric board of a second-class city operated as an independent board under the authority of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc96s96.172" target="_blank">96.172</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        The reason for the requirement of notice is to provide an opportunity for the city to investigate all the circumstances and prepare its defense. Dukes v. Louisville, 415 S.W.2d 110, 1967<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 304</cite> (Ky. 1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although one of the primary purposes of the notice is to give the city an opportunity to investigate the cause of the accident and to determine the condition of the defect complained of, another purpose is to enable the city to examine the injuries alleged to have been sustained. Roehrig v. Louisville, 454 S.W.2d 703, 1970<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 288</cite> (Ky. 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section contemplates that the notice is to be given by or at the direction of the injured person. Roehrig v. Louisville, 454 S.W.2d 703, 1970<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 288</cite> (Ky. 1970).

        KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.110" target="_self">411.110</a></cite> and CR 5.02, when construed together, mean that the notice required by the statute must be served on the “mayor, city clerk or clerk of the board of aldermen” by delivering or mailing a copy of the notice to one of these enumerated officials.

        On a matter of first impression, the exterior stairs attached to the police department building were not a public thoroughfare for purposes of the Ky. Rev. Stat.

        The giving of the notice required by this section is a condition precedent to the bringing of an action. Whether notice has been given is a question of jurisdiction which can be raised at any time during the action. The fact that the city filed a motion to make the complaint more definite and certain before demurring on ground of failure to give notice would not waive the lack of notice. Treitz v.

        The giving of notice under this section is a condition precedent to the maintaining of an action against a city for damages arising from a defect in a sidewalk, regardless of whether the city had actual knowledge of the defect. Reibel v. Woolworth, 301<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc76" target="_blank">Ky. 76</a></cite>, 190 S.W.2d 866, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 693</cite> (Ky. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Compliance with this section is a prerequisite to the right to invoke the help of the courts. Hancock v. Anchorage, 299 S.W.2d 794, 1957<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 426</cite> (Ky. 1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The notice required by this section is a mandatory prerequisite to an action and a notice of an accident in which several people were injured which was otherwise sufficient but which omitted the name of one of the injured persons precluded the omitted person from maintaining an action although the city had actual notice. Dawson Springs v. Reddish, 344 S.W.2d 826, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 259</cite> (Ky. 1961).

       <p>
        Acceptance of service of notice from plaintiff’s attorney by city clerk did not constitute waiver of immunity from suit and was a sufficient compliance with this section. Elsemere v. Brown, 297<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc323" target="_blank">Ky. 323</a></cite>, 180 S.W.2d 86, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 726</cite> (Ky. 1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Service of notice of action as required by this section had to be on the persons named in the statute and service upon the city attorney was held insufficient. Wellman v. Owensboro, 282 S.W.2d 628, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 259</cite> (Ky. 1955).

        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Mere mailing of letter to mayor of city is not sufficient compliance with this section, and the fact that the city attorney replies to the letter and denies the liability of the city does not estop the city to rely on the failure to give notice in the statutory form. Treitz v. Louisville, 292<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 654</cite>, 167 S.W.2d 860, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 730</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commencement of action against city and service of summons on mayor, within 90 days of accident, does not constitute compliance with the requirement that notice be given, even though the pleadings in the action contain all the required information. This section must be literally complied with. Ballinger v. Harlan, 294<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc72" target="_blank">Ky. 72</a></cite>, 170 S.W.2d 912, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 381</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        The service of a bare summons on the city does not furnish the information required in the notice. Irvine v. Cox, 296<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 680</cite>, 178 S.W.2d 199, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 609</cite> (Ky. 1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice served on mayor within 90 days of accident setting out that plaintiff suffered “a broken hip and other injuries” on a certain date, that the injuries were due to defective condition of sidewalk at a certain location, and that she intended to claim damages from city was sufficient to satisfy requirements of this section. Louisville v. Verst, 308<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc46" target="_blank">Ky. 46</a></cite>, 213 S.W.2d 517, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 862</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice stating a named person sustained injuries to his head on a given date and time in front of a street address in a named city and that his automobile was also damaged was inadequate as it clearly did not set out the “character and circumstances” of the injury where from reading the notice one could not tell how the injuries were received and it did not state whether the accident occurred in the street, on the sidewalk, or at the curb and did not set out the alleged defect in the thoroughfare. Berry v. Louisville, 249 S.W.2d 818, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 882</cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice was held adequate as to the persons named in it although it omitted the name of one of the persons injured in the accident, the time of day the accident occurred, and the exact manhole at which the accident occurred where the street was five (5) blocks long and had at least five (5) manholes in it and gave the cause of the accident as “a manhole protruding upwards above the surface” of a named street in a named city over which street the injured persons were traveling in an automobile. Dawson Springs v. Reddish, 344 S.W.2d 826, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 259</cite> (Ky. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice was not indefinite but it was too specific or specific to the point of being erroneous and thus insufficient where it stated plaintiff slipped and fell on second section of sidewalk when in fact she slipped and fell on section three (3) of sidewalk and city discovered at the onset that the accident could not have happened as specifically stated in the notice because of the newness of section two (2) which lulled it into justifiable belief that there was no need for any further investigation. Dukes v. Louisville, 415 S.W.2d 110, 1967<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 304</cite> (Ky. 1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the notice given to the city of the injury did not specify in what way the street was defective nor attempt to describe the personal injuries the plaintiff sustained, the notice was defective. Louisville v. O'Neill, 440 S.W.2d 265, 1969<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 338</cite> (Ky. 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiff satisfied the notice requirement by leaving a copy of a notice letter at the mayor’s office with the person in charge thereof and by mailing the notice to the mayor on the 90th day. Dreifus v. City of Grayson, 2001<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 16</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 16, 2001).

         9. — — Correct Date.
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where timely notice of accident was transmitted to municipality, failure to give correct date of accident was fatal and dismissal of suit was not reversible error, since the correct date of any alleged accident is an essential and mandatory element of a statutory notice. Baldridge v. Ashland, 613 S.W.2d 430, 1981<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 228</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff fell on a sidewalk outside of a city building and provided pre-suit notice indicating that she sustained injury “on or about January 18” and where plaintiff learned after filing suit that the actual date of her injury was January 20 and she amended her complaint to reflect the accurate date, the trial court erred in granting a judgment on the pleadings in favor of the city based upon its argument that plaintiff failed to strictly comply with the statutory notice requirement regarding the time of her injury because the phrase “on or about,” when used in connection with a definite point of time, did not put the time at large but indicated that it was stated with approximate accuracy. A period of three or four months would not be within the referenced time frame, but “on or about” a certain date could cover a period of several days; clearly, two days was within the span of several days, and thus, notice that an accident occurred “on or about” a particular date included a date two days subsequent thereto. Denton v. City of Florence, 301 S.W.3d 23, 2009<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 283</cite> (Ky. 2009).

        Where the executor of an estate was sued and the executor joined the city as a party alleging a claim for contribution, the failure of the executor to give the notice required by this section would not bar the prosecution of a claim for contribution.

      Any person having both the legal title and possession of land may prosecute suit, by petition in equity, in the circuit court of the county where the land or some part of it lies, against any other person setting up a claim to it. If the plaintiff establishes his title to the land the court shall order the defendant to release his claim to it and to pay the plaintiff his costs, unless the defendant by his answer disclaims all title to the land and offers to give such release to the plaintiff, in which case the plaintiff shall pay the defendant’s costs, unless for special reasons the court decrees otherwise respecting the costs.

        Circuit court erred in summarily denying the adjoining owners' motion to alter, amend, or vacate a judgment quieting title in property claimed through adverse possession to the buyers because the court failed to address the issue of indispensable parties where the controversy could not be resolved between the existing parties without prejudicing the rights of the record owners' unknown heirs where they had an interest and the suit would prejudice their rights to the property.

        The establishment of an agreed line to settle boundary dispute between landowners as to the correct location of the line had the effect of investing them with such title up to the line as gave them a right of possession and would enable them to bring a suit to quiet title to the same extent as if they had perfect paper title to it.

        It is a rule universally recognized that in an action to recover land the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title and not by weakness of the title of his adversary and, unless he is relying on adverse possession for more than 15 years, he must show paper title back to the Commonwealth or back to a common grantor but this is not necessary where the controversy involves merely the correct location of the boundary line between the parties.

        Where defendants never insisted upon actual possession as a prerequisite to plaintiff’s right to sue and issues were joined on the claim of possession made by each, proof heard and the case submitted, defendants were deemed to have waived any objection to the action on the ground that plaintiff was not in actual possession.

        Defendants in quiet title suit waived the question of possession when by answer and counterclaim they asserted superior title in themselves and sought to have same quieted. Frasure v.

        Defendant was held to have waived question of possession. Johnson v. Collins, 209<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc82" target="_blank">Ky. 82</a></cite>, 272 S.W. 47, 1925<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 430</cite> (Ky. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendants asserted title to land by answer and counterclaim and seek affirmative relief, the court will consider the entire evidence and pass on the question of superiority of title, even though plaintiff did not have possession required to maintain action. Strunks Lane &amp; Jellico Mountain Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Anderson, 276<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 576</cite>, 124 S.W.2d 779, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 552</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        Ordinarily, both paper title and possession must be shown by the plaintiff in an action to quiet title, but where defendant asserts title by counterclaim and asks affirmative relief, the courts will pass upon the question of inferiority of title notwithstanding plaintiff’s failure to show actual possession. Justice v. Staton, 291<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.15.html#tXVc179" target="_blank">Ky. 179</a></cite>, 163 S.W.2d 471, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 206</cite> (Ky. 1942).

       </p>
       <p>
        To maintain successfully an action to quiet title, it is necessary for the plaintiff to allege and prove title and possession, except proof of possession by plaintiff is waived by defendant and the case will be decided on its merits if defendant asserts title by answer and counterclaim and seeks to have his title quieted. Davis v. Daniel, 295<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 717</cite>, 175 S.W.2d 501, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 340</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        An answer to a complaint seeking relief under this section which consists of a denial, an allegation of title by adverse possession under color of title and a claim of estoppel by agreement as to the disputed line but which does not seek affirmative relief by counterclaim does not waive the requirement that plaintiff have actual possession at the time the complaint is filed. Haws v. Short, 304 S.W.2d 924, 1957<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 289</cite> (Ky. 1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requisite proof of possession is waived, generally, when defendant asserts ownership by counterclaim; however, the waiver of proof of possession does not waive the required proof of title by plaintiff in quiet title action. Kephart v. Rucker, 379 S.W.2d 244, 1964<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 229</cite> (Ky. 1964).

        Plaintiff had a right to maintain an action under this section where neither he nor the defendant had actually occupied or inclosed the disputed strip and it was within the true boundary of plaintiff’s record title.

       <p>
        Remaindermen can maintain an action to quiet title during the life of the original life tenant who conveys the fee although they are out of possession, since the lapse of time would rob them of the sources of evidence by which to establish their disputed claim and in this class of cases the possession of the life tenant is the possession of the remaindermen. Alley v. Alley, 91 S.W. 291, 28<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1073</cite>, 1906<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 349</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1906).

       <p>
        This section did not apply and it was not necessary to show possession of the land where plaintiff’s deed to mineral rights was on record and defendants attempted to convert the mineral rights to their use by conveyances. Eversole v. Virginia Iron, Coal &amp; Coke Co., 122<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 649</cite>, 92 S.W. 593, 29<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 151</cite>, 1906<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where action is to prevent the appropriation and conversion of plaintiff’s own title, it is not necessary to allege or prove possession, but where the defendant is casting a cloud on the plaintiff’s title by claiming the property under a different and hostile title and not through and under the plaintiff’s own title, then it is necessary to allege and prove possession. McGiboney v. Newman, 277<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 835</cite>, 127 S.W.2d 860, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 738</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        In action to quiet title to uninclosed forest land of which plaintiffs had constructive possession, fact that defendants had fenced off land did not deprive plaintiffs of such possession as was necessary to maintain action to quiet title, defendants being mere trespassers. Calhoun v. Gayhart, 280<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 170</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 760, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 83</cite> (Ky. 1939).

       <p>
        Where both parties in action to quiet title had possession of their respective farms, and both claimed title to the four (4) acres in dispute, this four acres being uninclosed forest land between the lines, the possession of the land in controversy, not being actually occupied, attached to the better title.

        Action to quiet title may be maintained by an owner not in possession when effort is made by defendant to seize and fraudulently appropriate particular title under which plaintiff claims.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had seized and fraudulently appropriated particular title under which plaintiff claimed, plaintiff, in that event, could maintain the quiet title action by showing ownership of the land, although he could not show actual possession.

        In quiet title action under this section where defendants’ claim arose by virtue of mortgage executed by them to plaintiff and the only relief sought was for fraud and deceit practiced upon plaintiff by defendants, defendants’ claim was not hostile to plaintiff but was a transitory action which must be brought in the county in which some of the defendants who may be properly joined as such reside or are summoned and not in the county where the land was located. Shouse v. Taylor, 115<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc22" target="_blank">Ky. 22</a></cite>, 72 S.W. 324, 24<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        When a tract of land lies partly in two (2) or more counties, the aggrieved party affecting any part of it may go into the courts of any one of the counties in which any part of that tract may lie, since the action is authorized for injury to the land as an entity.

        In an action to quiet title, where defendant elects to try title by alleging that he has title, and asking by way of counterclaim that his title be quieted, he only waives the question of possession, and plaintiffs have the burden of proving their title.

        Action in which plaintiff did not claim any possession of the land in herself but alleged defendant was in possession, though tried in equity, constituted an action in ejectment and not an action to quiet title under this section.

        Plaintiff failed to establish his right to land and, since defendants merely denied the title asserted by plaintiff without seeking any affirmative relief in respect to their title and established adverse possession, court was not authorized to adjudge a superiority of title in the plaintiff under the rule of waiver.

        A petition for quieting title stating plaintiffs are the owners and in the possession of a certain described boundary of land in a named county, that defendants are interfering with them in the quiet enjoyment of the use and occupation of the land by threatening to institute vexatious suits of trespass and ejectment for said possession, and by threatening to commit trespasses on the land under a claim of right states a cause of action and demurrer should be overruled. Boyd v. Clarke, 59 S.W. 511, 22<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1018</cite> (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Allegations of petition to quiet title that plaintiff was in actual possession of and owned the land described, that defendant had been setting up claim to said land and was now doing so, that he was giving it out in speeches that he was the owner of said land, that he had entered upon said land and trespassed thereon by cutting and sawing valuable oak trees standing and growing on the land and was continuing to do so and was threatening to cut and destroy and convert to his own use more of said trees and was doing all of said acts unlawfully and without right and that by all of said claims and acts the defendant was clouding plaintiff’s title to the land and injuring him in the quiet possession of same sufficiently stated facts showing defendant was setting up claim of right hostile to the right of plaintiff. Campbell v. Campbell, 64 S.W. 458, 23<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 869</cite> (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the general allegation in a quiet title action that plaintiff was the owner and entitled to possession of the land, proof of adverse possession was competent without specific pleading to that effect. Conyers' Adm'x v. McGee, 294<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc382" target="_blank">Ky. 382</a></cite>, 171 S.W.2d 450, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Where plaintiff alleged in its amended and substituted petition to quiet title that it had both the legal title to and possession of the land in litigation and defendant was setting up an adverse claim to the property and the verified copy of the deed on which plaintiff relied was attached as Exhibit A and it confirmed the allegations of the petition, the petition stated a cause of action. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Smith, 251 S.W.2d 855, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 937</cite> (Ky. 1952).

        Where in suit to quiet title under this section plaintiffs failed to allege that they were in possession of the property, the court should have sustained demurrer but given them leave to amend if they desired. Goff v. Lowe, 80 S.W. 219, 25<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 2176</cite> (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition which did not allege that defendants were still claiming the land or that plaintiff was in possession of it was insufficient under this section to remove a cloud from the title. Goosling v. Chapman, 147<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 491</cite>, 144 S.W. 380, 1912<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 276</cite> (Ky. 1912).

       <p>
        If plaintiff had been content to have averred that he was the owner of the land and in its actual possession, and that the defendant was wrongfully claiming to be the owner of the oil and gases therein which were a portion of the land, and to have designated the nature of the defendant’s claim as nearly as practicable without describing its chain of title but so as to show the claim was hostile and adverse to plaintiff’s title, a sufficient cause of action would have been stated under this section; but when he went further and showed defendant claimed under his grantor without showing his own deed was prior in time and therefore superior, the petition was insufficient to state a cause of action. Arnett v. Elkhorn Coal Corp., 191<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 706</cite>, 231 S.W. 219, 1921<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 369</cite> (Ky. 1921).

       <p>
        Petition to quiet title as against heir or original owners was insufficient, as against general demurrer, for not alleging plaintiff obtained title from or through original owners. Pendley v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Petition alleging that plaintiffs “are seized in fee simple” of the land in question was not a sufficient allegation of actual possession, and demurrer was properly sustained. Smith v.

        A defendant, in a suit to quiet title, may set up mortgages and other liens, the claims, if valid, being enforceable and, if spurious, being a cloud on the title. Sebree v. Johnson's Committee, 99 S.W. 340, 30<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 681</cite> (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendants seek affirmative relief by their pleading, although it is styled merely an answer, it must be taken to be their answer and counterclaim. Bennett v. Parsons, 226<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 782</cite>, 11 S.W.2d 935, 1928<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 173</cite> (Ky. 1928). See Wood's Guardian v. Inter-Southern Life Ins.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant in quiet title action stated in his answer that he ought to recover the land from plaintiff because he himself was also the owner of it, and he closed his prayer in the usual way for “all proper relief,” it was sufficient to entitle court to adjudge him the owner of the land if evidence justified it. Hopkins v. Slusher, 266<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc300" target="_blank">Ky. 300</a></cite>, 98 S.W.2d 932, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 657</cite> (Ky. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the plaintiff in his quiet title action is not in possession, the case will be decided on its merits if the defendant asserts title by answer and counterclaim and asks that his title be quieted, but this rule has no application where the defendant merely denies plaintiff’s title and possession and asserts his own title but does not ask for affirmative relief. McGiboney v. Newman, 277<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 835</cite>, 127 S.W.2d 860, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 738</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        Where starting point in patent description was described as being same as starting point in earlier patent to another, evidence as to long-continued recognition of certain point as starting point of first patent was of strong evidentiary value in determining starting point in second patent. Smith v. Slusher, 291<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.51.html#tXXXXXIc600" target="_blank">Ky. 600</a></cite>, 165 S.W.2d 38, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Where the original action was a forcible entry action by a lessee against his lessor and the lessor then filed a quiet title action against the lessee and the two (2) actions were consolidated, neither party could achieve title because of the failure of proof on the part of his adversary so, where there was not sufficient evidence to support a judgment quieting title in either party, the lower court properly dismissed the forcible entry action but erred in finding in the quiet title suit that lessor had fee-simple title. Frasure v. Bull, 307<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 726</cite>, 212 S.W.2d 280, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 822</cite> (Ky. 1948).

        Where plaintiff, in action to quiet title, pleaded specifically record title only, and defendant did not enter a specific plea asserting his own title but merely pleaded a traverse, the issue was confined to the one question of plaintiff’s record title and plaintiff could not recover on basis of adverse possession even though he proved adverse possession.

        The chancellor, after hearing proof, on his own motion transferred case to ordinary docket for a jury to determine location of division line and beginning corners. This amounted to granting an issue out of chancery, which the court had authority to do on his own motion. Merritt v. Palmer, 289<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc141" target="_blank">Ky. 141</a></cite>, 158 S.W.2d 163, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 514</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        Where there was a failure in plaintiff’s paper title and he did not show title by adverse possession, defendant who counterclaimed, claiming paper title and title by adverse possession and who established title by adverse possession, was entitled to a directed verdict in the quiet title action. Stearns Coal &amp; Lumber Co. v. Douglas, 299<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc314" target="_blank">Ky. 314</a></cite>, 185 S.W.2d 385, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        In an action in equity to quiet title, the verdict of the jury is not binding on the court but is merely advisory and may be wholly disregarded by the court. Poff v. Richardson, 312<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.19.html#tXIXc237" target="_blank">Ky. 237</a></cite>, 227 S.W.2d 175, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1111</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since suits to quiet title are and have historically been properly triable in equity before a chancellor, it is within the discretion of the court whether questions of fact will be submitted to the jury and the Rules of Civil Procedure have not changed the method of trial of equitable issues. Gibson v. Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co., 321 S.W.2d 256, 1958<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 17</cite> (Ky. 1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        The adjudication of title to land, such as quieting title, is peculiarly one for a court of equity, and the issues are not triable by a jury. Tarter v. Medley, 356 S.W.2d 255, 1962<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 94</cite> (Ky. 1962).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A judgment in a quiet title action brought in a state court under this section must embrace all claims to the title to the land which could have been asserted by any party thereto and will bind and estop all the parties to the suit. Davis v. Planters' Trust Co., 196 F. 970, 1912 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1610 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1912</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although judgment quieting title cannot be enforced because of 15-year limitation, it is still effectual as evidence of the facts which it determined. Creech v. Jenkins, 276<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc163" target="_blank">Ky. 163</a></cite>, 123 S.W.2d 267, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 540</cite> (Ky. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment quieting title estops defendant from claiming title by adverse possession so long as judgment remains in effect, although no writ of possession was issued. Creech v. Jenkins, 276<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc163" target="_blank">Ky. 163</a></cite>, 123 S.W.2d 267, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 540</cite> (Ky. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claims of both parties were somewhat unsatisfactory and plaintiff failed to show possession, court was justified in awarding title to defendant on counterclaim. Justice v. Staton, 291<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.15.html#tXVc179" target="_blank">Ky. 179</a></cite>, 163 S.W.2d 471, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 206</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant, in action of ejectment, counterclaimed, asserting title in himself, judgment against him on the counterclaim was res adjudicata as to sources of title relied upon by defendant in that action but did not preclude defendant, in subsequent action to quiet title, from setting up new source of title acquired since first action. Hopper v. McBurney, 293<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc31" target="_blank">Ky. 31</a></cite>, 168 S.W.2d 374, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 565</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to prove possession as required by this section as a condition precedent to the maintenance of an action to quiet title was waived by appellant’s filing of a counterclaim asking that he be adjudged the owner by adverse possession and that his title be quieted and, since both parties were then seeking adjudication of title, it was the duty of the court to decide the controversy by determining merely which had the superior title and when plaintiff alleged and proved a title vested in him by an apparently valid deed and defendant made no attempt to prove title in himself by adverse possession or otherwise, judgment determining plaintiff had superior title was not in error and plaintiff was not required to prove a title deducible from the Commonwealth or a common source. Goins v. Catron, 300<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 583</cite>, 190 S.W.2d 322, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 635</cite> (Ky. 1945).

        A state could regulate and protect individual rights to her soil and declare what would form a cloud over titles and, having so declared, the courts of the United States, by removing such clouds, were only applying an old practice to a new equity created by the Legislature. Clark v. Smith, 38 U.S. 195, 10 L. Ed. 123, 1839 U.S. LEXIS 429 (1839), distinguished and extended in Wickliffe v. Owings, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 47, 15 L.

        Law that provided that any person who had both legal title and possession of land could institute suit against any other person setting up a claim thereto and, if complainant was able to establish his title, the defendant was decreed to have released his claim and was required to pay the costs or if defendant should have disclaimed all title and have offered to give release the complainant was required to pay all costs, having created a right, and at the same time prescribed the remedy to enforce it, if the remedy prescribed was substantially consistent with the ordinary modes of proceeding on the chancery side of the federal courts, no reasons existed why it should not have been pursued in the same form as in the state courts. Clark v. Smith, 38 U.S. 195, 10 L. Ed. 123, 1839 U.S. LEXIS 429 (1839), distinguished and extended in Wickliffe v. Owings, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 47, 15 L.

        Where trustee in bankruptcy was made a party defendant to a quiet title action in a state court suit under this section and disclosed his claim to the land by an answer filed in the suit, he could not later file a suit in equity in federal court to determine that conveyance to plaintiff in the state court suit was a mortgage void as a preference, since the state court had jurisdiction to adjudicate his claim to the land because: (1) state courts are given concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts by the bankruptcy act, (2) the claim of the trustee must be heard before the state court can determine whether the title of plaintiff should be quieted as against the trustee in bankruptcy, and (3) comity between courts of concurrent jurisdiction requires that the court in which suit is last commenced shall yield to that in which a suit involving the same subject matter was first brought. Davis v. Planters' Trust Co., 196 F. 970, 1912 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1610 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1912</cite>).

        Under the federal equity practice, as well as under this section, bill to remove cloud or to quiet title cannot be maintained without proof of possession and legal title nor where the plaintiff is not in possession of premises.

        In ejectment action involving boundary dispute, it was unnecessary for defendants to pray that their title be quieted, since that consequence would inevitably result if they prevailed in their defense.

        In action for trespass, plaintiff cannot prove his own title by proving that his predecessor in title successfully defended actions brought by third parties to quiet title and to recover value of timber removed, where those actions did not require the defendant therein to prove the validity of his own title.

        Where real estate was sold at auction with understanding that purchaser would get clear title, and, after the sale, it was discovered that there were some restrictions as to use in the chain of title constituting a cloud on the title, the seller could not remove such cloud merely by inserting allegations as to adverse possession in his petition to an action against the purchaser to compel specific performance and asking that these clouds be removed by judgment of the court.

        Where a widow, who was not properly acting in the status of the personal representative of her husband’s estate, did not fulfill the requirements of one who is authorized to bring a wrongful death action nor did she take necessary steps to remedy the deficiency, the trial court had no alternative but to direct a verdict against the widow.

        A right of action for wrongfully causing death did not exist at common law, but is a right given solely by statute. Smith's Adm'r v. National Coal &amp; Iron Co., 135<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 671</cite>, 117 S.W. 280, 1909<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 244</cite> (Ky. 1909). See Stewart's Administratrix v.

       </p>
       <p>
        There are two (2) statutes in this state giving the right to maintain an action for wrongful death: this section, authorizing an action by decedent’s personal representative for death through negligence or any other wrongful act, and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.150" target="_self">411.150</a></cite>, giving the right of action to a widow and minor children (now children under 18) of a man killed by the use of deadly weapons where such killing was not done in self-defense, and these statutes are supplementary, although they were originally complementary. Sturgeon v. Baker, 312<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc338" target="_blank">Ky. 338</a></cite>, 227 S.W.2d 202, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 638</cite> (Ky. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the context of the statute as a whole, “prosecute” necessarily means to commence and carry out a legal action, and the statute does not accord any benefit of the recovery to the personal representative; the right to bring an action is not always tantamount to the right to benefit from that action. Pete v. Anderson, 413 S.W.3d 291, 2013<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 588</cite> (Ky. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the plain language of the statute, the cause of action “belongs” to the beneficiaries of the wrongful death claim. Pete v. Anderson, 413 S.W.3d 291, 2013<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 588</cite> (Ky. 2013).

        Under this section, there may be a recovery for death by ordinary negligence of the superior servant engaged in the same employment. Southern R. Co. v. Otis' Adm'r, 78 S.W. 480, 25<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1686</cite> (1904).

        This section which follows Ky. Const., § 241, is remedial, and should be liberally construed to effectuate its objects, and it applies no less to an injury inflicted by an overt act than to those resulting from the neglect of a legal duty. Randolph's Adm'r v. Snyder, 139<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc159" target="_blank">Ky. 159</a></cite>, 129 S.W. 562, 1910<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Kentucky Constitution, § 241 and this section were intended to and do confer a right to sue for damages in every case where death results from injury inflicted by negligence or wrongful act except only where, under the very provisions of these enactments, an action is impossible because the responsible party is also the sole beneficiary of any possible recovery. Bays v. Cox' Adm'r, 312<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 827</cite>, 229 S.W.2d 737, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 750</cite> (Ky. 1950).

        Punitive damages were recoverable where an employer was not an agent of the city, and thus did not qualify as an entity of local government, and evidence of gross negligence existed, specifically; that the employer misrepresented the situation to the Department of Highways in order to circumvent the permit process, that it changed the original detour route without notifying the proper entities, that no traffic control plan was implemented, that there were no advance warning signs at the work zone, that improper barricades were placed at the ends of the work zone, and that the employer left only 90 feet of buffer zone between the barricades and the trailer, when industry standards required at least two hundred twenty (220) feet.

        An administrator who has no greater or broader powers with respect to his decedent’s rights than she had is in no better position to maintain an action than she was in and cannot therefore maintain an action to recover for the death of his intestate even though it be alleged and proven that her injury was more serious than thought at the time of institution and trial of actions wherein she recovered a judgment for such injuries before her death and even though she left surviving her a husband and minor child.

        Where the deceased’s alleged widow had nominated another for appointment as administrator of the deceased’s estate, which consisted solely of a claim for damages arising from the accident in which he was killed, the court did not abuse its discretion in appointing the deceased’s father who could be expected to claim the proceeds of such claim as the only heir of the deceased on the ground that the alleged widow was never validly married to the decedent.

        Ky. Const., § 241 and this section mandate that all actions for wrongful death be maintained by the personal representative of the deceased.

        If, while in the womb, it (the unborn child) reaches that prenatal age of viability when the destruction of the life of the mother does not necessarily end its existence also, and when, if separated prematurely and by artificial means from the mother, it would be so far a natural human being that it would live and grow, mentally and physically, as other children generally, it is but to deny a palpable fact to agree there is but one life, and that is the life of the mother.

        When a pregnant woman is injured through negligence and the child, if it be a viable infant, suffers death as a consequence, a right of recovery exists to the personal representative provided the causal relation between the negligence and the damage to the child is established by competent evidence.

        As the injuries of decedent were received and death occurred in a sister state, although the suit was brought in this state where the administrator qualified, the right of action was conferred by the statutes of the sister state and the statutes of the sister state were controlling.

       <p>
        This section has no extraterritorial effect and, although it is presumed that the common law prevails in a sister state, it is not presumed that the statutes of a sister state are the same as the statutes of this state; therefore, no action can be maintained in this state to recover for death in a sister state without proof of what the law in the sister state is.

        Where death of the decedent occurred in this state and the cause of action arose therein, the remedy offered by its law must control as to the recovery of damages for his death under Ky. Const., § 241, and this section, relating to and providing remedies for wrongful death, and the action is in the resident administrator alone. Compton's Adm'r v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Administrator’s right of action for death is not based on the death of his decedent but on the wrongful causing of the death by the defendant, so the cause of action is governed by the laws of the state where the injury or accident occurs, although he may not have a cause of action until the death which may occur elsewhere. Melton's Adm'r v. Southern R. Co., 236<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 629</cite>, 33 S.W.2d 690, 1930<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 829</cite> (Ky. 1930).

        Action for damages for death is a “transitory action,” and the law of the place where the injury occurs governs in respect to the right of action. Stewart's Administratrix v.

        The court did not err in directing verdict for defendants in action for damages for death of plaintiff in Canada caused by alleged negligence of defendant in Canada where there was no allegation or proof as to what the Canada law was regarding the right to maintain an action for damages for death, since the common law of Kentucky would not permit recovery for death and, on failure to plead and prove laws of foreign state or country, only one presumption arises and that is that the common law of the foreign state or country is the same as the common law of Kentucky and there is no presumption without pleading and proof as to what is the statute of any other state or foreign country.

        The substantive law of the place where a tortious wrong was committed determines the right of action and the distribution or apportionment of damages recovered for the wrongful death is considered part of the action and inseparable therefrom, the beneficiaries being named by the statutes of the state where the wrong occurred.

        Where certain acts cause death, they cannot be divided so as to make two actions — one to recover the suffering caused and the other to recover for death — but the party must elect and he cannot amend a petition alleging that “gross and willful neglect” caused death to allege gross negligence caused the injury resulting in 15 days’ suffering, as the complaint would as amended make one count for killing caused by willful neglect and another for suffering caused by gross neglect. Hackett v. Louisville, S. L. &amp; T. P. R. Co., 95<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.19.html#tXIXc236" target="_blank">Ky. 236</a></cite>, 24 S.W. 871, 15<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        Where the wrongful acts of one person cause the death of another, the right of recovery for the wrong done cannot be severed by the representatives of the deceased so as to maintain one action for the suffering endured by the deceased after the wrong and before his death and another action for the death itself.

        The word “negligence,” as used in this section and in Ky. Const., § 241, which will authorize a recovery when death results, is the actionable negligence which would authorize a recovery if death had not ensued. Singleton v. Felton, 101 F. 526, 1900 U.S. App. LEXIS 4429 (6th Cir. Ohio 1900). See Harlan Nat'l Bank v. Gross, 346 S.W.2d 482, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 309</cite> (Ky. 1961).

        In an action for wrongful death under this section, proof of ordinary negligence is sufficient. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Stewart's Adm'x, 131<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 665</cite>, 115 S.W. 775, 1909<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 55</cite> (Ky. 1909).

        If the death of a person results from injury inflicted as a result of the negligence of others, the deceased’s estate may recover damages. However, where decedent pointed an unloaded pistol at a SWAT officer serving a search warrant, the shooting of decedent was an act of self-defense, and decedent’s estate could not recover. Whitlow v.

       <p>
        Punitive damages were recoverable where an employer was not an agent of the city, and thus did not qualify as an entity of local government, and evidence of gross negligence existed, specifically: that the employer misrepresented the situation to the Department of Highways in order to circumvent the permit process, that it changed the original detour route without notifying the proper entities, that no traffic control plan was implemented, that there were no advance warning signs at the work zone, that improper barricades were placed at the ends of the work zone, and that the employer left only 90 feet of buffer zone between the barricades and the trailer, when industry standards required at least two hundred twenty (220) feet.

        Kentucky Constitution, § 241 gave a right of recovery to the personal representative regardless of whether the decedent left a widow or child and a petition for death of the plaintiff’s intestate caused by the “willful, gross, and reckless negligence” of a telephone company which showed it was brought under Ky. Const., § 241, was sufficient against demurrer. East Tennessee Tel. Co. v.

        The rule that plaintiff must aver and show that decedent was not aware of the danger of risk which applies in common-law actions for injuries to servants which do not result in immediate death does not apply in actions under Ky. Const., § 241, and this section, and contributory negligence is a matter of defense in these actions. Lexington &amp; Carter County Min. Co. v.

        Where the petition shows a contributory negligence that, if pleaded as a defense, would defeat a recovery, the question may be reached by a demurrer to the petition. Stillwell's Adm'r v.

        In action to recover for death under this section, it is unnecessary to allege decedent did not know of danger or defect; knowledge on decedent’s part is matter of defense.

        Petition in action by administratrix for intestate’s wrongful death by gunshot wound by coal company clerk and alleging a conspiracy of the company and its employees to shoot striking union members who entered the company store was sufficient for an action for wrongful death, as there was a charge that a conspiracy was formed between the company and its employees to commit a wrongful act and that pursuant to and in furtherance of that act plaintiff’s intestate, who was an invitee in the store and an innocent party, was killed.

        Where original complaint which alleged that the death of intestate resulted from willful neglect of engineer in charge of and operating the engine attached to and drawing the train which killed him was amended to withdraw allegation of “willful neglect” and substituting “negligence,” the amendment merely alleged a different degree of neglect and not a new cause of action.

        An amendment charging for the first time that there was a statute of Virginia allowing a recovery for the death of one produced by the negligence of another was germane to the original cause of action sued on, therefore relating back to the time of the filing of the original petition so as to save the running of the statute, since it did not change the parties, the nature of the action, or the cause of it but merely perfected that which was imperfect.

        A father who brought a wrongful death action for the death of his seven-year-old son when struck by an automobile could, if he had not secured a valid appointment as administrator of his son’s estate and if the judgment were set aside for that reason, still remedy the omission and proceed by amendment, although the statute of limitations had run, as the amendment would relate back to the filing of the original complaint and the case of Totten v.

        The rule is that if the injury or loss complained of by a person seeking recovery was caused by his own negligence, it will defeat a recovery, although the person committing the injury may also have been negligent, and the fact that the action is brought under this section for the destruction of life does not change the rule; the only difference is that in such case the burden is upon the defendant to show the contributory negligence that is relied upon to defeat a recovery.

        Unless there is something more shown than the marital relation or a parent-child relation, negligence should not be imputed, so the negligence of the father will not bar recovery for the benefit of the mother in an action by administrator of a child’s estate for damages for its wrongful death.

        Court of Appeals is definitely committed to the doctrine that a father may not recover where his wife’s negligence contributed to the death of a child, since the wife-mother is considered the father’s agent as to the custody of the child and since the recovery sought is for their joint benefit.

        Paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of this section precludes negligent parents from obtaining a recovery for a tortious act to the child, but the failure of parent to remove disabled vehicle to a narrow shoulder was not negligent as a matter of law nor was the failure to remove three babies in the night to a narrow shoulder of a road grown up in weeds in close proximity to heavy traffic passing by at high speed and the administrator for two of the infants who were killed when the automobile was struck in the rear by a truck could recover for their wrongful death.

        To the extent that any parent may be found guilty of contributory negligence or of imputed contributory negligence, the rule is that such parent is barred from recovery under this section, known as the wrongful death act, and this is true in cases involving violations of the child labor act.

        In an action brought under this section, which was enacted in pursuance of Ky. Const., § 241, to recover for death, it was not necessary that the plaintiff should prove that the deceased exercised ordinary care for his own safety or did not know of the danger, but the defendant may show, to establish contributory negligence, that the deceased was not exercising ordinary care and that he did know of the unsafe appliance or place.

        Ordinarily, evidence concerning the character and habits of the decedent is relevant because they have a bearing on his earning capacity, but evidence reflecting adversely on the moral character of the decedent should be permitted only in the clearest of cases in which its probative value distinctly outweighs its prejudicial effect.

        When the question is one of negligence or no negligence, it is well-settled law that where the evidence is equally consistent with either view, the court should not submit the case to the jury for the party affirming the negligence has failed to prove it; therefore, where evidence taken as a whole tended as much to show that the death of a patient was due to the delay in performing a mastoid operation as any other cause, and it was wholly a matter of conjecture that if the operation had been performed on the day the patient went to see the doctor, the patient’s life could have been saved, the court properly refused to submit the case to the jury.

        Testimony that a negligently inflicted injury merely hastened a death resulting solely from a previously contracted fatal disease is not equivalent to proof that the injury was a proximate cause thereof when neither the extent of the “hastening” nor the manner in which the injury operated to produce it is shown and hence such testimony is insufficient to sustain a recovery in an action instituted by the personal representative under the authority of Ky.

        In an action by decedent’s administrator brought in behalf of decedent’s widow and infant child for wrongful death, evidence failed to prove cause of death or any negligent act which could be determined to have been the cause of death where only proof was decedent died from lack of oxygen, and doctor performing autopsy testified that had he been poisoned by gas the result of the autopsy would have been the same and there was no testimony that the conversion to natural gas was done in an unworkmanlike manner or that the furnace had caused any trouble, but the testimony disclosed the cabin was small, four people were present that day, the thermostat controlling the furnace was set high and the heat was excessive, which three factors could have caused the lack of oxygen.

        In an action for wrongful death brought under this section by a mother who was administratrix of her daughter’s estate against her daughter’s husband arising out of an automobile accident in Ohio, the competency of the mother as a witness and of her proposed testimony would involve the ascertainment of whether she had a pecuniary interest as a matter of fact under the Ohio law, but other factors which might be considered, such as a disclaimer or extinguishment of any interest by the witness and her qualification to testify on behalf of her decedent’s minor child, although not for herself as a beneficiary, if it would be found that she would be such beneficiary, would be determinable under Kentucky law where the action was brought.

        Testimony of mother that her deceased daughter told her over the telephone that she and her husband had spent $300 on an automobile trip was self-serving, but her testimony that the deceased husband confirmed the statement in his conversation may be regarded as an admission against his interests in that it recognized contractual relationship giving wife the status of a paying passenger rather than as a social guest.

        Where the services which were compensated for by the basic reparations benefits (BRB’s) were but the ordinary and necessary services that come with day-to-day family life and not services producing economic benefit, these services are clearly not an element of damages for wrongful death, thus the survivor’s replacement services loss benefits should not be credited against a wrongful death award.

        In seeking the value of room, board, and other essentials provided to the decedent, i.e., approximately $25,000, which the decedent received as payment for the daily care she provided to her parents, her father, as the administrator of the estate, was not seeking compensation for the lost benefit of having the decedent work in his house, but instead was attempting to articulate the basis for the destruction of the decedent’s earnings claims under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.130" target="_self">411.130</a></cite>.

        In an action for wrongful death, it is the duty of the jury to fix the actual sum of money which would fairly compensate the estate of decedent for the destruction of decedent’s power to earn money and the affliction which has overtaken the family by reason of the death or the number of children can have no legitimate bearing on the question. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Eakins' Adm'r, 103<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 465</cite>, 45 S.W. 529, 20<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 736</cite>, 1898<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        If the administrator sues to recover for the death of his intestate caused by the negligence of another, there can be no recovery for the physical or mental suffering of his intestate or the mere impairment of his power to earn money, but recovery is for the death of the intestate alone and is limited to such a sum as will compensate his estate for the destruction of his power to earn money. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Simrall's Adm'r, 127<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 55</cite>, 104 S.W. 1011, 31<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1269</cite>, 1907<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        The wages being earned is merely evidence for the jury to consider, and the damages recoverable under this section do not depend solely upon the earnings but are an important circumstance constituting one element that must be considered in connection with many other pertinent facts.

       <p>
        Hospital and physician’s bills are not recoverable in an action brought under this section, since the only recovery that can be had is for the destruction of decedent’s power to earn money, which confines the right of recovery to damages for the death of the decedent and does not allow for any financial loss sustained by him prior to his death. West v. Nantz' Adm'r, 267<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 113</cite>, 101 S.W.2d 673, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        The measure of damages for death in this state is the permanent reduction of decedent’s power to earn money and not the loss sustained by any particular claimant or claimants.

        The jury, of course, had the right without any evidence of earning power to exercise their own judgment in the matter and determine to what extent the decedent’s earning power had been reduced.

        Measure of damages in action for wrongful death is amount of loss to the estate of deceased because of the permanent reduction of his power to earn money. Wilkins v.

       <p>
        Damages for death is such sum as fairly and reasonably compensates decedent’s estate for the destruction of his power to earn money, and the nature of the injuries has no bearing on the amount of damages. Cuniffe's Ex'x v. Johnson, 279<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 663</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 47, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 341</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Necessarily, damages for death are speculative and depend on many unpredictable factors such as the length of time the decedent would have lived but for the accident, the probable condition of his health thereafter and his ability to work, retention of his employment, amount of his earnings, and amount saved out of his earnings. Cuniffe's Ex'x v. Johnson, 279<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 663</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 47, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 341</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        Failure to furnish jury with proof as to decedent’s earning power will not prevent them from exercising their own judgment in the matter and determining the amount of damages the estate has suffered.

       <p>
        Since a pension is a substitute for earning power, a pension, especially one that will continue until the death of the recipient, is a proper element to be considered by the jury in arriving at a verdict in an action brought for damages for the death of a person by tortious act pursuant to this section. Heskamp v. Bradshaw's Adm'r, 294<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 618</cite>, 172 S.W.2d 447, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 507</cite> (Ky. 1943).

        Cause of action for wrongful death accrues to the estate of the deceased and the measure of damages is the destruction of the deceased’s power to earn money. Spangler's Adm'r v.

        Where decedent was killed in automobile collision caused by concurrent negligence of her husband and another defendant, in an action by decedent’s personal representative against the two defendants the husband was not entitled to share in the recovery; however, the decedent’s two surviving children were entitled to one half the amount of the verdict less funeral expenses and costs of administration, and judgment should have been entered for such amount, plus expenses and cost, with the amounts to be assessed against the defendants in proportion to amount of verdict against each.

        The measure of damages in a wrongful death action is the destruction of the deceased’s power to earn money and not the destruction of decedent’s income from the particular work in which he was engaged at the time of the wrongful death and decedent’s potential for earning money is a proper consideration. Roland v. Beckham, 408 S.W.2d 628, 1966<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 126</cite> (Ky. 1966).

        The statute has been construed to measure damages by loss to the decedent’s estate, although the damages, once recovered, are distributed directly to the statutory beneficiaries. Empire Metal Corp. v. Wohlwender, 445 S.W.2d 685, 1969<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 170</cite> (Ky. 1969).

        Court properly based its allowance of attorney fees on the actual recovery, rather than the damages found by the jury, where the jury apportioned 50 percent of the damages to plaintiff’s negligence.

       <p>
        The damages recoverable in a wrongful death action are such sums as will fairly and reasonably compensate the decedent’s estate for the destruction of the decedent’s earning power and do not include the affliction which has overcome the family by reason of the wrongful death. Department of Education v. Blevins, 707 S.W.2d 782, 1986<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 257</cite> (Ky. 1986).

       <p>
        The measure of damages for a wrongful death under this statute is the value of the destruction of the power of the decedent to earn money; the existence and status of survivors has no bearing on the calculation of this value.

       <p>
        Punitive damages were recoverable where an employer was not an agent of the city, and thus did not qualify as an entity of local government, and evidence of gross negligence existed, specifically: that the employer misrepresented the situation to the Department of Highways in order to circumvent the permit process, that it changed the original detour route without notifying the proper entities, that no traffic control plan was implemented, that there were no advance warning signs at the work zone, that improper barricades were placed at the ends of the work zone, and that the employer left only 90 feet of buffer zone between the barricades and the trailer, when industry standards required at least two hundred twenty (220) feet.

        The earning power of the deceased extended to the probable duration of his life is the measure of damages in an action by personal representative to recover for wrongful death and an instruction to the jury that they should award such sum as “will reasonably and fairly compensate the estate of decedent for the destruction of the power of decedent to earn money” with the entire question, without any other specific instruction on the subject of the power to earn money, left to the jury was sufficient.

        The jury should be instructed only to the effect that the measure of damages in a death case is such sum as will reasonably compensate the estate of the decedent for the destruction of his power to earn money and the jury should not be told that the loss is the amount which would probably be made and saved but for the intervening death.

        Unpublished decision:
    In a tort action for negligence, products liability, loss of consortium and wrongful death arising from a collision between a tractor trailer and a car driven by decedent, the trial court properly ruled for defendants because plaintiffs were unable show that any of the defendants committed a wrongful or negligent act. There was no evidence that the underride guard design was defective or that it was in a state of disrepair. Richardson v. Rose Transp., Inc., 617 Fed.

        In action by plaintiffs to recover damages (1) for destruction of their son’s earning power, (2) for the pain and suffering of their son prior to his death and (3) for loss of affection and companionship of their son, defendants were entitled to credit for any amount previously collected by son’s estate from the Department of Transportation, Bureau of Highways for damages for his death, only against the amount plaintiffs recovered for destruction of earning capacity of decedent, since the Board of Claims has no authority to award damages for pain and suffering or for loss of affection and companionship. Blankenship v. Watson, 672 S.W.2d 941, 1984<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 535</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1984), overruled,

        While the second sister pled a cause of action for wrongful death against the nursing home following the death of the mother, the first sister did not show that a factual basis for a recovery under a wrongful death theory pursuant to existing Kentucky law. Thus, the first sister’s argument about how the federal court settlement proceeds in the matter should be distributed, nothwithstanding the fact that KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.133" target="_self">411.133</a></cite> did not provide a distribution scheme, was academic at best because no such recovery was involved.

        The damage provisions of the federal death on the high seas act, 46 USCS § 761, rather than this section, were found applicable in a wrongful death action resulting from an accident involving the collision on the Ohio River of a pleasure cruiser and a tow of 15 barges. In re American Commercial Lines, Inc., 366 F. Supp. 134, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11164 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1973</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because Kentucky law did not recognize a claim by an adult parent for the loss of a minor’s consortium, or a claim by a minor child for the loss of a parent’s consortium, and limited both types of consortium claims to wrongful death actions, pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.135" target="_self">411.135</a></cite>, the parent and child’s consortium claims were dismissed. Ferguson v. Aventis Pasteur, Inc., 444 F. Supp. 2d 755, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14425 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2006</cite>).

       <p>
        In an action arising from an airplane crash, the airline company was entitled to dismissal of the survivors’

Combs v. Comair, Inc. (In re Air Crash at Lexington, KY), 556 F. Supp. 2d 665, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1216 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2008</cite>).

       <p>
        By authorizing damages to the parents of a “minor” child for loss of affection and companionship that would have been derived from such child “during its minority,” the Kentucky legislature excluded an award of loss of consortium to the parents of an adult child; any other interpretation of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.135" target="_self">411.135</a></cite> renders the modifier “minor” and the words “during its minority” meaningless.

        The parents of a deceased child have a claim under this section for loss of affection and companionship without regard to whether the personal representative of the decedent ever asserts a claim for wrongful death under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.130" target="_self">411.130</a></cite>, and, indeed, without regard to whether a personal representative is ever appointed; therefore, the parents’ claim is separate and apart from that of the personal representative.

        As the legislature recognized the individuality of children in this section by providing a loss of consortium claim to parents who lose a child, children have a common-law claim for loss of parental consortium. There is no legal distinction between the two (2) causes of action as both seek to redress wrongs which destroy the parent-child relationship. Giuliani v.

        In a wrongful death action, a limited retrial was required because a jury verdict of zero awarded for a child’s power to earn money was inadequate. On retrial, the jury should also be informed of such sums as were previously awarded to the decedent’s estate for loss of affection and companionship, for pain and suffering from the time of the child’s injury until the child’s death, and for medical and funeral expenses.

        The Supreme Court recognizes that there is measurable value to one’s life other than his or her earning capacity; however, this value is already recoverable in the recognized category of mental suffering, and there is no need to allow for the recoupment of hedonic damages as a separate category of loss.

        Children’s claims for loss of parental consortium were dismissed because Kentucky law prohibited recovery for a minor’s loss of consortium claim if it was not accompanied by a wrongful death claim. Since KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.135" target="_self">411.135</a></cite> provided a parent with a loss of consortium claim for the loss of a minor child only in wrongful death actions; the “reciprocal” of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.135" target="_self">411.135</a></cite> was also limited to wrongful death cases.

        Summary judgment for an employer and the driver of a work vehicle that struck a deceased grandchild just prior to her death was proper in an action by her grandparent guardian, seeking to recover for loss of consortium, as the clear language of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.135" target="_self">411.135</a></cite> included only certain particular classes of persons and excluded other unmentioned classes such as grandparents.

        While the court did not expressly restrict a child’s claim for loss of parental consortium, the court did say that it was creating a reciprocal claim to the statute; however, there was no reciprocity interest in this case because Kentucky statutes do not recognize a parent’s claim for loss of consortium with their adult children.

        Zero award of damages to parents of a minor child who drowned in a hotel pool required a new trial for the award of some amount for the parents’ loss as the parents testified regarding memories with the child, the emotional pain endured while the child lingered on life support following the drowning, and the loss suffered after the child’s death. While one parent shared fault with the hotel for the child’s drowning, that fault did not preclude recovery, but only required that any award be apportioned based on the percentage of fault.

        When determining if a father forfeited a share of his child’s wrongful death proceeds by abandoning the child, the child’s estate had no burden of proof as to distribution of the proceeds because (1) the proceeds were not part of the estate, and (2) the estate’s administrator had no interest in the proceeds’ distribution, once the proceeds were recovered.

     <p>
      No right of action for personal injury or for injury to real or personal property shall cease or die with the person injuring or injured, except actions for slander, libel, criminal conversation, and so much of the action for malicious prosecution as is intended to recover for the personal injury. For any other injury an action may be brought or revived by the personal representative, or against the personal representative, heir or devisee, in the same manner as causes of action founded on contract.

        Whether an action should survive to the personal or real representative of the plaintiff is a matter of policy to be settled for itself by each state and, although under Indiana law the cause of action for wrongful death dies with the decedent, an action filed in Kentucky by an Indiana resident for injuries in Indiana who died while the action was pending could be revived in the name of the decedent’s personal representative appointed in Kentucky since the law of the forum applied.

        Under federal law, an action for penalties and forfeitures recoverable under congressional enactment does not survive, but abates with death of claimed violator of statute. Bowles v. Farmers Nat'l Bank, 147 F.2d 425, 1945 U.S. App. LEXIS 2154 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1945</cite>).

        The question of the survival of an action, which did not exist at common law and was purely the creature of congressional enactment, was not governed by state statute of survival and, in the absence of an act of congress, the federal courts were entitled to apply the proper rules of federal law under their own standards.

        The word “slander” as used in this section embraces libel, and the right of action for a libel does not survive the death of plaintiff. Johnson's Adm'x v.

        The actions which survive in this state are those which survived at the common law and such others as are specifically named in this section and, since this section does not make provision for survivorship of election contests and at common law the courts did not have jurisdiction to try election contests, an appeal in an election contest abates upon the death of either party to it.

        An action by husband for damages for the alienation of the affections of his wife is in the same nature and genus as an action for criminal conversation with her and the measure of damages, and the only basis upon which damages may be recovered, in each action are the same, and they are actions to recover damages for personal injuries — not for physical injuries to the person — and they do not survive.

        Although a medical malpractice action alleging delay in the diagnosis of breast cancer had to be revived or brought in the name of the personal representative of the estate when the patient/party in interest died under CR 25.01(1), KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.140" target="_self">411.140</a></cite>, and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.34.html#tXXXIVc395s395.278" target="_blank">395.278</a></cite>, a radiologist’s employer waived the revival requirement by continuing to actively litigate the case for over three years after the expiration of the revival statute of limitations.

        Trial court properly set aside the jury verdict and granted a long-term care facility a new trial because not only had the facility preserved the issue of standing, but an estate’s claims under the long-term Residents’ Rights Act were improperly submitted to the jury since the resident had predeceased the claim; the statutory duties merely codify the common-law standard of care and do not survive the death of the resident.

Pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.145ol12" target="_self">411.145(2)</a></cite>, the wife’s personal injury claim and her husband’s loss of consortium claim were not based on a common and undivided interest; even if the husband had continued to pursue his claim, that would not have affected the court’s analysis of the amount in controversy.

        Circuit court erred in holding that the insureds could recover under a loss of consortium claim against the insurer because, while either a wife or husband could statutorily recover damages against a third person for loss of consortium and loss of consortium was an independent cause of action, neither spouse had a substantive, bodily injury claim against the insurer under the policy where the insurance policy clearly and unambiguously excluded underinsured motorists coverage for bodily injury sustained by an insured while occupying an owned motorcycle.

        When defendant admitted liability for negligent injury to plaintiff, it became liable under this section to plaintiff’s wife as a matter of law for any loss of consortium which resulted from that injury. The fact that defendant contested the severity of plaintiff’s injuries did not relieve it of liability for his wife’s claim. The jury was always free to decide that defendant’s injuries were too slight to impact his wife’s right to consortium. Transit Authority of River City (TARC) v.

        Though the legislature failed to pass a bill to expand this section to include a right of action for a child’s loss of consortium from the wrongful death of a parent, the court extended the common law to include such right of action.

        Unpublished decision:
    In a tort action arising from a collision between a tractor trailer and a car driven by decedent, plaintiff's loss-of-consortium claim accrued on the day of her husband's accident and was barred by the one-year statute of limitations; she waited nearly three years before she sued two defendants and four years before she sued the third defendant. The claim also failed, because plaintiffs were unable show that any of defendants committed a wrongful or negligent act. Richardson v. Rose Transp., Inc., 617 Fed.

       In absence of any court decisions on the matter, properly certified medical technicians employed by county ambulance board would be covered by the immunity provisions of this section so long as those persons are not paid directly by the persons to whom they render aid and assistance and further assuming that their actions do not constitute willful or wanton misconduct and that the aid rendered is confined to those places mentioned in the statute.<cite class="OAG">OAG 78-258</cite>.

       The immunity provisions of this section do not apply to mere ambulance drivers, the board members of the ambulance service organization, or to those medical technicians not properly certified.<cite class="OAG">OAG 78-258</cite>.

        Where plaintiff averred his son who was past 18 years of age was “enticed, seduced, overpersuaded, and hired” by defendant’s agent without plaintiff’s knowledge or consent to labor for defendant at a sawmill, that defendant unlawfully placed plaintiff’s said son to work among lawless boys and negligently, carelessly and knowingly permitted said minor boys to wrangle and lawlessly fight with sticks, clubs, rocks, knives and pistols at divers times, all of which was unknown to plaintiff or plaintiff’s son until his son was shot and killed by the minor employees of defendant, the facts alleged were not such as would entitle anyone to maintain a cause of action under this section.

        If an action is brought under this section by the widow alone, the minor child or children, appearing by their guardian or next friend, have the right to be made parties plaintiff and the widow cannot control the action so as to defeat a recovery by the minor child or children. She may dismiss it insofar as she is concerned but the dismissal as to her will not be permitted to interfere with its prosecution by the child or children if they are parties to it, nor will it bar an action instituted by them within the proper time.

        An instruction given by the court was objectionable where it in effect made defendant’s right of self-defense depend on the belief of the jury as to whether he was in danger at the time he killed the decedent, while the true rule was for the jury to find from the evidence whether the accused, at the time he shot and killed the decedent, then had reasonable grounds to believe, and did in good faith believe, that his life was in danger from violence at the hands of the decedent with the usual limitation added that accused might then only take the life of decedent provided he had no apparent and safe means of protecting his own life and person than by so taking the life of decedent.

       </p>
       <p>
        If the jury believes that defendant, with intent to assault, beat or kill deceased, sought and first attacked deceased, and never abandoned said attack until he shot deceased, the jury should not find for defendant on the ground of self-defense.

        Unless defendant is excusable upon the ground of self-defense, then he is not excusable for the killing, though he did it under such circumstances as would make it manslaughter only, and not murder.

        Although pleas of self-defense and mutual combat are ordinarily inconsistent, it was prejudicial for the court not to give a self-defense instruction where the defendant pleaded both and the court did not require him to elect but he did in effect make an election when he offered an instruction on self-defense and objected to the giving of an instruction on mutual combat and the evidence showed a possibly inferable abandonment of the conflict by the defendant which was consistent with a plea of self-defense but inconsistent with a plea of mutual combat. Coleman v. Hager, 307<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc70" target="_blank">Ky. 70</a></cite>, 208 S.W.2d 316, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 581</cite> (Ky. 1948).

         10. — Burden of Proof.
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section does not place the burden of negativing self-defense upon the plaintiff but simply emphasizes a plea of self-defense based on the evidence and, in the absence of such evidence, an affirmative instruction upon it is, as a general rule, improper. Clolinger v. Callahan, 204<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 33</cite>, 263 S.W. 700, 1924<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 406</cite> (Ky. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        An admission of the assault charged in a civil action and a plea of self-defense by the defendant places on the defendant the burden of proof of self-defense with the accompanying right to conclude the argument. Johnson v. Porter, 208<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.33.html#tXXXIIIc390" target="_blank">Ky. 390</a></cite>, 270 S.W. 813, 1925<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 294</cite> (Ky. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action under this section, mere proof of homicide by defendant without any evidence with respect to having been committed maliciously and not in self-defense was not sufficient to warrant submission of case to jury. Sturgeon v. Baker, 312<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc338" target="_blank">Ky. 338</a></cite>, 227 S.W.2d 202, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 638</cite> (Ky. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden rests upon the plaintiff in an action brought under this section to introduce evidence tending to show that the homicide was “by the careless, wanton or malicious use of a deadly weapon, not in self-defense,” and on failing to sustain such burden, there is no right of recovery. Sturgeon v. Baker, 312<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc338" target="_blank">Ky. 338</a></cite>, 227 S.W.2d 202, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 638</cite> (Ky. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        In actions under this section, the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove that the killing is not in self-defense. Arthurs v. Johnson, 280 S.W.2d 504, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 163</cite> (Ky. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff adequately met the burden of proving that killing was not in self-defense where evidence established defendant shot and killed her husband, who was a deputy sheriff, while he and other officers were attempting to serve warrant for a lunacy inquest, not because of fear decedent was planning to subject him to death or great bodily harm but because he had determined to resist by force any effort to remove him from the house and, under these circumstances, even if the arresting procedure had been unlawful, defendant would have had no right to kill one of the officers in resisting arrest. Arthurs v. Johnson, 280 S.W.2d 504, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 163</cite> (Ky. 1955).

        An instruction “At the time of his death the life expectancy of
    . . . . .
    (deceased) was 28.6 years, and in estimating the actual damages the plaintiffs have sustained the jury will consider the probable net earnings of the deceased during that period, taking into consideration his capacity to earn and his business habits,” without any testimony having been introduced on the subject of life expectancy, isolates the expectancy from all, or nearly all, other facts and circumstances with which, under the evidence, it properly stands connected, such as that the health of the deceased was only fairly good, that for a year he had not been able to work continuously, that his habits were only fairly good and that he was reasonably industrious and gives undue prominence to the life expectancy.

        The measure of damages in an action for killing by malicious use of firearms was such a sum as would reasonably compensate the widow and children for the loss they sustained of the power of deceased to earn money, and, in addition thereto, the jury could give vindictive damages, the total recovery being divided one half to the widow and the other one half to the children. Archer v. Bowling, 166<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc139" target="_blank">Ky. 139</a></cite>, 179 S.W. 15, 1915<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 653</cite> (Ky. 1915).

        In the client’s legal malpractice action against her attorney, the recovery of lost punitive damages in legal malpractice actions was prohibited, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184ol11f" target="_self">411.184(1)(f)</a></cite>. Allowing the client to recover lost punitive damages would not advance the policy underlying punitive damages in any way; in fact, allowing recovery would be antithetical to what punitive damages stand for, which was untying the concept of punitive damages from its doctrinal moorings. Osborne v. Keeney, 399 S.W.3d 1, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 203</cite> (Ky. 2012), limited, Ind. Ins. Co. v. Demetre, 527 S.W.3d 12, 2017<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 364</cite> (Ky. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the longstanding case law noting the purpose of punitive damages and Kentucky’s stated requirement of allowing recovery only against the wrongdoer, it aligns with those jurisdictions that prohibit recovery of lost punitive damages in legal malpractice actions. Osborne v. Keeney, 399 S.W.3d 1, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 203</cite> (Ky. 2012), limited, Ind. Ins. Co. v. Demetre, 527 S.W.3d 12, 2017<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

    The claimant has reviewed the facts of the case and has consulted with at least one (1) expert qualified pursuant to the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure and the Kentucky Rules of Evidence who is qualified to give expert testimony as to the standard of care or negligence and who the claimant or his or her counsel reasonably believes is knowledgeable in the relevant issues involved in the particular action, and has concluded on the basis of review and consultation that there is reasonable basis to commence the action;

An affidavit or declaration executed pursuant to this paragraph shall be supplemented by an affidavit or declaration pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection or paragraph (c) of this subsection within sixty (60) days after service of the complaint or the suit shall be dismissed unless the court grants an extension for good cause; or

     Action on lost, destroyed, mutilated or defaced writing.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An ordinary or equitable action may be brought upon a bill of exchange, or a note or other obligation, or upon an indorsement or assignment thereof, which, or upon a judgment the record of which, is lost, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced, without fraud on the part of the plaintiff, or of those under whom he claims. But no action shall be brought upon an instrument transferable by delivery, merely, which is alleged to be lost, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced, without a previous tender by the plaintiff to the defendant, if his name and place of residence be known to the plaintiff, of an indemnifying bond, with good surety, nor shall judgment be given against the defendant, in such action, until such bond is given, with good surety approved by the court.

        In the absence of proof that the note in controversy was lost or destroyed without fault of the deceased or the executor bringing the action, the executor could not recover thereon. Sutton v. Russell's Ex'r, 236<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 535</cite>, 33 S.W.2d 629, 1930<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 801</cite> (Ky. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action on a lost note where the plaintiff alleged that the original note and mortgage were lost through no fraud on his part, that no part of the note had been paid, and that the note was not transferable by delivery and plaintiff did not execute a bond to the defendant, the court erred in dismissing the action upon plaintiff’s failure to comply with defendant’s motion to produce the note. Fuson v. Henderson, 256<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 729</cite>, 77 S.W.2d 8, 1934<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 484</cite> (Ky. 1934).

       <p>
        In an action on a note where a lien was retained in a deed to real estate to secure payment of the note and an amended petition was filed under this section alleging the original note had been lost, the Court of Appeals, after careful consideration of the evidence, was convinced the note had been paid and that the note previously filed in the action was a forgery. Dixon v. Ward, 267<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 619</cite>, 103 S.W.2d 113, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 377</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was held that it was a prerequisite under this section for the petition to allege that the note was lost or misplaced without fraud on the part of the plaintiff. Hoyland v. National Bank of Middlesborough, 137<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 682</cite>, 126 S.W. 356, 1910<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 612</cite> (Ky. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff, suing on a lost note, failed to allege that the loss was brought about through no fraud of himself or of those under whom he claimed, the trial court erred in overruling defendant’s demurrer, but where the proof showed that there was no such fraud, the court could not properly grant the defendant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Crawford v. Crawford, 222<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 708</cite>, 2 S.W.2d 401, 1928<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 245</cite> (Ky. 1928).

        A sufficient bond having been given before judgment, the circuit court properly refused to dismiss the action because bond had not been given before suit was filed. Kimbrough v.

        There is a distinction between a guaranty executed simultaneously with the principal contract and one subsequently made and based upon a separate consideration and, where the contract and guaranty are executed simultaneously, a joint action will be permitted against the principal and guarantor; but it is otherwise if they are not simultaneously executed, for in such case the principal and guarantor should be separately sued.

        Where plaintiff filed suit against defendant for defendant’s negligent operation of her vehicle and where no one made a claim against plaintiff’s husband, the driver of plaintiff’s car, and no one had sued him or settled with him by a release or agreement not to sue, the trial court erred when it instructed the jury to consider the duties of plaintiff’s husband in arriving at an apportionment of fault and damages upon one who did not fall specifically within the scope of this section. This section applies to persons named as parties, regardless of how named, and those persons who bought their peace from the litigation by way of releases or agreements. These persons affected by the statute are explicitly denominated, and plaintiff’s husband did not fit into any of the described classifications. Bass v.

        In a medical malpractice action in which a hospital was dismissed as a party on the ground of sovereign immunity, the other defendants were not entitled to have the jury nevertheless apportion fault to the hospital since there was no evidence at trial to show that the hospital was responsible for any injury to the plaintiff.

        Taking each allegation in the manufacturer’s cross-claim for indemnity, contribution, and apportionment of fault as true, the fact remained that no agency relationship existed between the parties and it could not be said with certainty that any negligence by the instructor or supervisor was the primary cause of the chief’s injuries; a jury could find that the chief was injured based on the manufacturer’s failure to design a harness correctly or supply proper warnings, or the jury might determine all parties were equally liable, and summary judgment was not appropriate.

        In a two-party products liability case, where the facts of the case raised a jury issue of whether or not the plaintiff was negligent, and whether such negligence was a substantial factor in causing his death (and perhaps would justify a directed verdict for the defendant), the court should have applied the principle of contributory negligence pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.320" target="_self">411.320</a></cite> and Reda Pump Co., Etc. v. Finck, 713 S.W.2d 818, 1986<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 283</cite> (Ky. 1986), rather than the principle of comparative negligence pursuant to this section. Koching v.

<span class="boldspan"></span>
    “Fraud” means an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of material fact known to the defendant and made with the intention of causing injury to the plaintiff.

<span class="boldspan"></span>
    “Malice” means either conduct which is specifically intended by the defendant to cause tangible or intangible injury to the plaintiff or conduct that is carried out by the defendant both with a flagrant indifference to the rights of the plaintiff and with a subjective awareness that such conduct will result in human death or bodily harm.

        Because Kentucky prohibits courts from construing statutes as retroactive unless the statute expressly so declares and there is no such express declaration in this section and court did not construe subsection (5) of this section as being the required express declaration, this section, enacted in 1988, was inapplicable to an action in damages for fraud where the events involved occurred in late 1979 and the early 1980’s. Miller's Bottled Gas v. Borg-Warner Corp., 56 F.3d 726, 1995 FED App. 0186P, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 14907 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1995</cite>).

        Evidence pertaining to prior litigation involving an insurance company and its adjuster is relevant in a punitive damages action alleging bad faith and unfair settlement practices in order to show the adjuster’s pattern of unfair methods in handling claims and the insurer’s knowledge of such conduct; however, monetary amounts involved in the prior litigation are not admissible. Kentucky Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Troxell, 959 S.W.2d 82, 1997<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 148</cite> (Ky. 1997).

        Since plaintiff would be potentially able to recover punitive damages for her claims related to products liability or under the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act, consideration of a potential punitive damage award could be considered when calculating the amount in controversy under 28 USCS § 1332. Hollon v. Consumer Plumbing Recovery Ctr., 417 F. Supp. 2d 849, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7789 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2006</cite>).

        When several homeowners sued the same builder for selling them four-bedroom homes that had septic systems approved for three bedrooms, it was error to instruct the jury on punitive damages under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184ol11b" target="_self">411.184(1)(b)</a></cite> because punitive damages for this type of fraudulent concealment were permissible only if the concealment itself caused damages independent of those flowing from the wrongful act attempted to be concealed; as to one owner, there was no evidence he incurred any damages from the concealment apart from the jury’s award of damages for breach of warranty, and as to the other homeowners, who also recovered damages based on building code violations and breach of warranty claims, even if the builder intentionally concealed information about the septic systems, there was no evidence that it did so with the intention of causing injury to the homeowners. Young v. Vista Homes, Inc., 243 S.W.3d 352, 2007<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 12</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).

        Where an auto dealer’s employee shot out the tires of plaintiff’s truck in order to repossess it, the dealer was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184ol13" target="_self">411.184(3)</a></cite> as there was no evidence that the dealer ever authorized the employee to use the conduct he employed to repossess the truck, and there was no factual issue as to whether the dealer should have anticipated the employee’s conduct; retention of the truck was not ratification of the means employed to repossess it. Patterson v. Tommy Blair, Inc., 265 S.W.3d 241, 2007<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 467</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).

        Because of the longstanding case law noting the purpose of punitive damages and Kentucky’s stated requirement of allowing recovery only against the wrongdoer, it aligns with those jurisdictions that prohibit recovery of lost punitive damages in legal malpractice actions, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184ol11f" target="_self">411.184(1)(f)</a></cite>.

        In the client’s legal malpractice action against her attorney, the recovery of lost punitive damages in legal malpractice actions was prohibited, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184ol11f" target="_self">411.184(1)(f)</a></cite>. Allowing the client to recover lost punitive damages would not advance the policy underlying punitive damages in any way; in fact, allowing recovery would be antithetical to what punitive damages stand for, which was untying the concept of punitive damages from its doctrinal moorings.

        Kentucky Supreme Court had not struck down the provision of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184" target="_self">411.184</a></cite> that allowed punitive damages awards for fraud, and the Federal District Court could not predict that the Kentucky Supreme Court would strike down KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.186ol12c" target="_self">411.186(2)(c)</a></cite>. Thus, the court granted plaintiff’s motion to compel discovery; plaintiff was entitled to discover defendant’s financial condition, not so plaintiff could present evidence of that condition to the trier of fact, but so that plaintiff could determine whether there was any evidence that defendant’s alleged misconduct resulted in a profit that it would not otherwise have gained.

        Where defendant intentionally killed the decedent, where he was convicted of murder but his conviction was reversed, where defendant pled guilty to manslaughter to avoid a retrial, where plaintiff, the decedent’s father, filed a wrongful death suit against defendant, where the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on the issue of liability and conducted a jury trial on the issue of damages, where the jury awarded $3.3 million in compensatory damages and $60 million in punitive damages, and where defendant challenged the propriety of the punitive damages award, the court held that the purpose of the punitive damage award was not to compensate the estate but to vindicate the state’s legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence of conduct of the type in which defendant engaged. Under that analysis, the $60 million punitive award was grossly excessive; as such, it was violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the punitive damages award was reduced to $30 million. Ragland v. Estate of Digiuro, 352 S.W.3d 908, 2010<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 201</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).

The record contained evidence that defendant’s offer of $18 per unit for the Canadian real estate investment trust, for which both defendant and plaintiff were bidders, was not genuine and that defendant’s tortious interference harmed plaintiff by causing plaintiff to pay an additional $1.50 per unit for the Canadian real estate investment trust beyond plaintiff’s initial offer of $15 per unit.

        Creditor established by clear and convincing evidence that the attorney committed fraud by telling the creditor that the loan the creditor made to the attorney’s client would be reimbursed once the client received an expected personal injury settlement and the reimbursement was not then forthcoming once the settlement was reached. Since the client showed that fraud had occurred, the trial court should have granted the creditor’s request to instruct the jury on the creditor’s punitive damage claim, pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184" target="_self">411.184</a></cite>, and on remand a new trial had to be held on the issue of punitive damages to see if the criteria for awarding them under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.186" target="_self">411.186</a></cite> had been met.

Although the investors asked the court for an award of punitive damages under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184" target="_self">411.184</a></cite>, the court denied plaintiffs’
    request because punitive damages were not required to deter the husband and wife from engaging in the same type of conduct in the future. Fontaine v. P&amp;J Resources, Inc. (In re P&amp;J Resources Inc.), 475 B.R. 838, 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 2167 (Bankr. E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2012</cite>).

        District Court erred in denying
    plaintiffs’ request for an instruction on the
    availability of punitive damages against
    defendant insured in their action alleging
    bad faith. Both contract formation and the
    insurer’s alleged bad faith refusal to pay a
    valid claim were issues for jury
    determination; that being so, the jurors
    should have been instructed that, under Kentucky law, they were free to consider
    punitive damages if they first found the
    insurer had deliberately rejected the
    plaintiffs’ claim in bad faith.

There was also proof that the bus company authorized and ratified the driver’s conduct, as she was trained to not admit fault for an accident and not to speak with victims and witnesses, and she was not instructed on all of the company’s safety policies.

        Where a restaurant corporation knew of a hoax that was being perpetrated at fast-food restaurants where a caller would represent himself to be a police officer, falsely accuse a female employee of theft, and convince managers and other employees to hold the employee in a locked room and subject her to strip and body cavity searches, where the hoax had been perpetrated at one of the restaurant corporation’s own restaurants, where corporate management made an executive decision not to inform employees and managers of the hoax or to provide training and guidance or instruction to prevent the hoax from successfully occurring again, and where the hoax was perpetrated again and the victim was sexually assaulted by one of her captors, the jury’s award of punitive damages was not unreasonable because the evidence permitted the jury to conclude that the restaurant corporation owed a duty to train, supervise, or warn about the hoax calls and that it failed in that duty.

        Successive awards of punitive damages for the same course of conduct do not violate due process. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Golightly, 976 S.W.2d 409, 1998<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 97</cite> (Ky. 1998).

       <p>
        Kentucky Supreme Court had not struck down the provision of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184" target="_self">411.184</a></cite> that allowed punitive damages awards for fraud, and the Federal District Court could not predict that the Kentucky Supreme Court would strike down KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.186ol12c" target="_self">411.186(2)(c)</a></cite>. Thus, the court granted plaintiff’s motion to compel discovery; plaintiff was entitled to discover defendant’s financial condition, not so plaintiff could present evidence of that condition to the trier of fact, but so that plaintiff could determine whether there was any evidence that defendant’s alleged misconduct resulted in a profit that it would not otherwise have gained. Derby Fabricating v. Packing Material Co., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28765 (W.D. Ky. Nov. 18, 2005).

        Where defendant intentionally killed the decedent, where he was convicted of murder but his conviction was reversed, where defendant pled guilty to manslaughter to avoid a retrial, where plaintiff, the decedent’s father, filed a wrongful death suit against defendant, where the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on the issue of liability and conducted a jury trial on the issue of damages, where the jury awarded $3.3 million in compensatory damages and $60 million in punitive damages, and where defendant challenged the propriety of the punitive damages award, the court held that the purpose of the punitive damage award was not to compensate the estate but to vindicate the state’s legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence of conduct of the type in which defendant engaged. Under that analysis, the $60 million punitive award was grossly excessive; as such, it was violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the punitive damages award was reduced to $30 million. Ragland v. Estate of Digiuro, 352 S.W.3d 908, 2010<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 201</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).

        Although the District Court did not cite KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.186" target="_self">411.186</a></cite> when calculating the amount of punitive damages awarded to the private plaintiffs in a nuisance action, the court explicitly considered two (2) of the statutory factors when it discussed the duration of defendants’ misconduct and their consistent refusal to stop fugitive dust from crossing their property lines. These references, taken in conjunction with the court’s other references to defendants’ conduct and the statute’s discretionary language, indicated that the court had applied the proper legal standard.

        Evidence that a motorist drove 34 miles per hour over the speed limit for a curve, at night, with two passengers, one of whom had warned him of the upcoming curve, was sufficient to create a jury question as to whether the motorist had acted with gross negligence. Therefore, his motion for a directed verdict, seeking dismissal of a punitive damages claim, was properly denied. Gersh v. Bowman, 239 S.W.3d 567, 2007<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        In litigation over an auto accident, since plaintiff did not sustain any separate and distinct damages as a result of defendant’s alleged concealment regarding discovery issues, the trial court erred by allowing testimony regarding it. However, the error was harmless, as there was sufficient admissible evidence that defendant’s conduct while driving amounted to gross negligence to justify a jury instruction on punitive damages.

        In a civil assault and battery case, punitive damages were properly awarded in a case where the evidence showed that an injured party was viciously attacked and severely beaten with an object; this conduct constituted an egregious display of total disregard for the safety of others.

        Creditor established by clear and convincing evidence that the attorney committed fraud by telling the creditor that the loan the creditor made to the attorney’s client would be reimbursed once the client received an expected personal injury settlement and the reimbursement was not then forthcoming once the settlement was reached. Since the client showed that fraud had occurred, the trial court should have granted the creditor’s request to instruct the jury on the creditor’s punitive damage claim, pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184" target="_self">411.184</a></cite>, and on remand a new trial had to be held on the issue of punitive damages to see if the criteria for awarding them under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.186" target="_self">411.186</a></cite> had been met.

        Circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it invoked Ky. R. Civ.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted a hotel’s financial records about revenues in the months before the decedent drowned in the hotel pool as well as the hotel manager’s bonus received in the prior year based on the hotel’s increased revenues because the evidence of the hotel’s revenue and expenses for the months immediately preceding the decedent’s drowning was not to inform the jury of the hotel’s financial condition but to show a need for increased staffing.

        When the concept of reasonableness and other factors identified were considered in the light of evidence presented, evidence from which the jury believed the bank engaged in an elaborate fraud to gain additional security for existing loans with no intentions of performing its representations of fact and with knowledge of the likely destruction of borrower’s business, punitive judgment was not so “grossly excessive” as to violate the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.

        Trial court’s punitive damages award to the clients was sustainable where knowing the clients’ aversion to tax risks personally and professionally, an accounting firm made false representations and omitted material facts imperative to the clients’ fully-informed decisionmaking as to a tax shelter the accounting firm was promoting, the firm never disclosed the general or specific problems with the tax shelter despite multiple IRS notices, legal opinions, and professional articles, and when the clients discovered on their own the potential problems, the firm continued to misrepresent the product.

        Instructions to the jury must define the purpose of punitive damages as punishment to the wrongdoer and as a deterrent to wrongdoers and others from such activities in the future and that the post trial procedures be in place and utilized by the trial court to scrutinize the award of such damages. The instructions in this case were adequate. Hanson v. American Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 865 S.W.2d 302, 1993<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 156</cite> (Ky. 1993).

Reasonable men and women will differ in determining the amount of exemplary damages, but so long as the jury’s decision is free of passion or prejudice and is appropriately reviewed by the trial judge, there is no basis for substituting the court’s opinion in the place of the jury’s.

        Jury award of punitive damages to plaintiff, who was brutally beaten by defendant after being found in defendant’s former betrothed’s apartment, could not stand because the trial court failed to incorporate in the jury instructions any of the factors enumerated in the statute and provided no standard whatsoever to assist or guide the jury in its determination.

        Pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.184ol13" target="_self">411.184(3)</a></cite>, the question of whether the hospital ratified the conduct of its employees in discharging decedent from its facility while decedent was suffering from a serious medical issue and had not been stabilized involved an issue of fact for the jury to decide and, thus, the jury could award punitive damages. However, the punitive damage award was excessive in part because the trial court did not instruct the jury as to any of the factors to consider in calculating the amount of punitive damages to be awarded as the trial court should have done pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.186ol12" target="_self">411.186(2)</a></cite>.

        Where a small airplane crashed into a client’s home and the attorney failed to inform the client of the dismissal of the client’s negligence suit against the pilot on statute-of-limitations grounds, the client was properly awarded punitive damages against the attorney in a legal malpractice action, but the client was limited under CR 8.01(2) to punitive damages in the amount of $1 million based on the client’s last itemization of such damages in the client’s trial memorandum.

    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.186" target="_self">411.186</a></cite>, which mandates that the jury consider all issues concurrently to include punitive damages, because the trial court bifurcated plaintiff’s claims as between defendants but did not bifurcate the punitive damages claims from either liability or compensatory damages as to each individual defendant. Therefore, plaintiff was free to pursue punitive damages and introduce evidence to support said damages in the first phase and second phase of the trial. Estate of Judith Burton v.

        This section, which specifies that collateral source payments shall be an admissible fact in any civil trial, is unconstitutional as it violates Ky. Const., §§ 27, 28 and 116 mandating and elaborating on separation of powers doctrine, intrudes on the responsibility exclusively assigned to the judicial branch or government, and serves, in this case, to confuse the jury regarding the factual issue rather than assist them in deciding the damages incurred by the plaintiff.

        This section was not so written as to express a substantive law change denying damages for medical expenses and wage loss in a civil action to those plaintiffs who have access to collateral source benefits, as to do so would violate Ky. Const., § 54. Those plaintiffs receiving collateral source payments cannot have their tort remedy denied as punishment for their prudence in obtaining insurance coverage to assist them in the event of a catastrophe, and their misfortune compounded by making them appear to seek damages for which they have no need.

        In subsection (2) of this section, the threshold question is not just whether there has been payment for something from a collateral source, but whether the payment is for an element of damages included in the tort action. When it is, the payor must be notified, must assert its claim in the tort action, and must be paid from the proceeds of the tort action. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co. v. Ruschell, 834 S.W.2d 166, 1992<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 91</cite> (Ky. 1992).

        This section prevents an insurer from remaining hidden from the fact-finder’s view when the insurer intends to benefit from a suit instituted against a tort-feasor. An insurer’s duty simply involves a motion to intervene with a notice of payment made and does not impose an onerous obligation to litigate the merits of that claim. McCormack Baron &amp; Assocs. v. Trudeaux, 885 S.W.2d 708, 1994<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 130</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).

        The legislature by enacting subsection (3) of this section, which mandates disclosure of collateral source payments and known subrogation rights, has decided that disclosure of insurance will not be deemed prejudicial per se; therefore, as a matter of law, public policy no longer requires the sanctioning of the loan agreement procedure in cases not involving life insurance payments. Lampton v. Boley, 870 S.W.2d 428, 1993<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 96</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1993).

       <p>
        The enactment of this section was aimed at eroding the collateral source rule and rendered evidence of collateral benefits and the existence of subrogated benefits admissible in tort and contract actions commenced after July 15, 1988, and the necessary implication permits fact-finders to consider the plaintiff’s receipt of collateral benefits and to decide to reduce the damages awarded accordingly.

        Subsection (3) of this section is merely a statutory rule of evidence which allows evidence of collateral source benefits to be admitted at trial, not because it is relevant to the measure of damages, but rather to temper jury verdicts; therefore, Kentucky’s collateral source rule was inapplicable in U.S. District Court.

        Compensation insurance carrier which made collateral source payments must intervene when notified of the commencement of the underlying tort action in order to preserve its claim for reimbursement from plaintiff’s recovery, but carrier need not separately, independently, and actively pursue its claim in the tort litigation to maintain its subrogation rights. Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Haile, 882 S.W.2d 681, 1994<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 89</cite> (Ky. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since under this section one who holds subrogation rights can preserve those rights only by acting affirmatively to announce his intention to be compensated by intervening in the action, where insurer was not notified by insured of suit against third party for damage caused to apartment by fire, but who had knowledge of such suit and did not intervene, insurer’s motion to intervene filed after entry of judgment was clearly filed out of time and trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. McCormack Baron &amp; Assocs. v. Trudeaux, 885 S.W.2d 708, 1994<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 130</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).

       <p>
        Once a motion in limine to exclude evidence of collateral source payments under this section has been overruled, a party may go forward with adverse evidence to avoid the appearance of concealment and still preserve error for appellate review: that to construe a motion in limine as waived by the plaintiff’s would defeat the purpose of the rule and destroy the value of having it.

        This section provides that an owner of land, who makes it available to the public for recreational purposes without payment of fees is under no general duty, and a person entering upon the premises takes the land as he or she finds it to be.

        Regulations pertaining to swimming and bathing facilities, 902 KAR 10:120, did not create liability on the part of a city for injuries sustained when the plaintiff jumped into a creek in a city park and injured his heel and foot, since the creek had not been modified for the purpose of public swimming or bathing.

        In encouraging dedication of land for recreational use by land owners, this section creates a class of users which, by such dedication, loses its label as trespassers, but does not acquire the label of invitees; this is a reasonable classification and there is no violation of Ky. Const.,

        The United States was the owner of land under the control of the Army Corps of Engineers, and as the land was available to the public to use without fees for recreation, its liability was limited by this section. Sublett v. United States, 688 S.W.2d 328, 1985<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 215</cite> (Ky. 1985).

        There was no liability on the part of the parks and recreation board, a joint city-county agency, where there was no contention of willful or malicious behavior. Page v. Louisville, 722 S.W.2d 60, 1986<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 1501</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).

        Although the injured plaintiff may have been subject to an admission charge at other times and had paid such charges before the date of his accident, it was undisputed that, on the day in question, he was not charged nor did he pay a fee for admission into the center’s pool; therefore, as the element of payment of an admission fee was missing, and there were no allegations of conduct rising to the level of willful negligence, the city and center were entitled to the immunity granted by this section and the plaintiff’s claim against them failed. Midwestern, Inc. v. Northern Kentucky Community Center, 736 S.W.2d 348, 1987<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 506</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1987).

        Even if owner of marina was negligent, where such negligence did not rise to the level of willful or malicious indifference to the rights of the drowned swimmers, the owner of marina was entitled to judgment as a matter of law under the Recreational Use Statute.

        In a negligence action in which an invitee alleged that he was injured when he fell from a swing on a school playground after school hours, the school principals and two employees were protected from liability under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.190" target="_self">411.190</a></cite> because the invitee did not contend that the injury resulted out of a willful or malicious failure to guard or warn, and because he did not challenge the free public recreational use of the land. Both principals had a duty to supervise school personnel, including the two employees who were charged with maintenance of the schools’
    grounds, and, to the extent that those obligations gave rise to a duty that would subject the principals and the employees to liability for failure to maintain the property or warn of dangerous conditions, their liability was limited by §<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.190" target="_self">411.190</a></cite>(3)-(4).

        Trial court did not err by granting the mall summary judgment in the mall walker's premises liability action where the mall could raise a defense under this section, as the mall knew about and condoned mall walking on its property before the stores opened, the mall walker was walking during a non-business hour at the time of her fall and was not window shopping, mall walking was a recreational purpose as it was a form exercise similar to swimming and hiking and nothing in the statute indicated that the legislature intended to limit recreational purposes to outdoor activities, and the mall's interior constituted land under this section.

        Despite the fact that the contract between the city and the community center purported to be a lease, it was clear from the language of the contract itself and the monetary arrangement between the city and the center that the document was essentially an employment contract pursuant to which the center was paid to manage and oversee the day-to-day operation of the facility; therefor, with regard to the question of ownership of the property, the city and center fell squarely within the provision of subdivision (1)(b) of this section, defining an owner as “a possessor of a fee interest” or one “in control of the premises.” Midwestern, Inc. v. Northern Kentucky Community Center, 736 S.W.2d 348, 1987<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 506</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1987).

        The payment of a “charge” for permission to enter upon land for recreational use, including swimming (and, logically, diving), is the one element necessary to defeat the blanket immunity granted by this section.

        A $2.00 fee charged to park at a city park did not constitute a fee to enter upon the land and use the park for recreational purposes where pedestrians and bicyclists could use the same entrance for no fee, there were other entrances into the park where no fee was charged, and there were other parking areas in the park which could be used for no charge. City of Louisville v. Silcox, 977 S.W.2d 254, 1998<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 74</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).

        The terms “willful or malicious” as used in subsection (6) of this section do not necessarily and solely entail an intention to do wrong and inflict an injury; therefore, liability will not be limited by this section if an owner of land acts with indifference to the natural consequences of its actions or evidences an entire want of care or great indifference to the safety of others.

        This section specifically provides that a person using the land of another for recreational purposes is not relieved from his obligation to exercise care as otherwise required by law, and the failure of owner of marina to guard or warn against a dangerous condition could not be said to be “willful or malicious.” Collins v.

The employees did not act willfully and maliciously as the danger to the child playing on the bleachers was obvious and not a trap set by the employees. Johnson v. Bond, 2019<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 38</cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2019 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 632 (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 22, 2019).

        Because deceased, who died while exploring defendants’ cave, was not on equal footing with the defendants, was unaware of the dangers inside the cave and relied entirely on his tour guide and because no public interests are served by encouraging commercial caving by validating such releases and the cave tour did not qualify as a recreational activity, waiver signed by deceased did not release defendants from liability and defendants’ motion for summary judgment was denied.

        Petitioners were not entitled to adverse possession because KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.190" target="_self">411.190</a></cite> applied retroactively, and even if their timber sale, as a non-recreational use, lay outside the scope of the statute, it would nonetheless apply to petitioners’
    solely-recreational-use claim prior to 1999 and thus left them with a claim that fell far short of the requirement that the adverse possession continue for fifteen years. Moore v. Stills, 307 S.W.3d 71, 2010<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 50</cite> (Ky. 2010).

        Evidence demonstrated that a disputed parcel of property had been enclosed by a fence since at least the 1940s. This fenced enclosure amounted to actual possession for purposes of a claim of adverse possession, not the sporadic recreational use of the property. Vick v.

       (7/13/2004). In 2004 Ky. Acts ch. 109, sec. 21, subsec. 4, “home inspector” is defined as “a person licensed in accordance with Sections 1 to 27 of this Act.” Because the home inspector licensure provisions in ch. 109 are confined to Sections 1 to 20, and Sections 21 to 27 set forth notice and opportunity to repair procedures that must be followed prior to bringing an action for damages against a home inspector, the reference to Sections 1 to 27 in subsection (4) has been changed by the Reviser of Statutes to the statutes at which Sections 1 to 20 are codified. See KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11a" target="_blank">7.136(1)(a)</a></cite> and (h).

        Because transactions involving blood and blood components are considered services, as opposed to sales, they are outside the purview of this Commonwealth's Products Liability Act. McKee v. Miles Laboratories, Inc., 675 F. Supp. 1060, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12025 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1987</cite>), aff'd, 866 F.2d 219, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 722 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1989</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Product Liability Act (PLA) codifies the idea that a manufacturer is not liable when the injuries result from the mutilation or alteration of the chattel since such intervening conduct severs any causal connection between the product and the injury precludes any imposition of liability on a manufacturer in cases where the product has not been used in its original, unaltered and unmodified condition. Monsanto Co. v. Reed, 950 S.W.2d 811, 1997<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 50</cite> (Ky. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a claim is brought against a seller or manufacturer of a product which is alleged to have caused injury then the Product Liability Act (PLA) applies, regardless of whether the action is founded on strict liability in tort, negligence, or breach of warranty. Thus while each of these theories of recovery in products liability cases requires proof of different elements and has different implications the central purpose is the same: recovery of damages for injury for property damage caused by a product. Monsanto Co. v. Reed, 950 S.W.2d 811, 1997<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 50</cite> (Ky. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Product’s Liability Act (PLA) does not attempt to abolish a right of recovery, be it jural or otherwise, but merely codifies long established Kentucky law that a manufacturer, under whatever legal theory, is not liable for injuries following the alteration, destruction, or mutilation of its product, or by its misuse which was not reasonably foreseeable. Monsanto Co. v. Reed, 950 S.W.2d 811, 1997<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 50</cite> (Ky. 1997).

        The Product Liability Act was inapplicable to an insurer’s subrogation claim against a fire alarm company seeking damages arising from a house fire because the contract between the insureds and the fire alarm company was not for the sale of goods, but was for services; while the fire alarm company agreed to supply the alarm system, title to the control set remained with the fire alarm company.

        The presumption set forth in this section may be rebutted by evidence that the product was defective, even if the product conformed to prevailing industry standards or the current state of the art.

        The purpose of subsection (2) is not to insulate an entire industry just because every member of the industry was manufacturing and distributing a product known to be dangerous; rather it is to protect a manufacturer from liability for failure to anticipate safety features which were unknown at the time the product in question was manufactured and distributed. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Golightly, 976 S.W.2d 409, 1998<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 97</cite> (Ky. 1998).

        Where the injured person suffered a ladder accident, the res ipsa loquitur doctrine created merely a permissible inference of negligence, and where the injured person offered no expert testimony to rebut the opinion of the manufacturer’s product safety engineer that the ladder met applicable safety standards, and had no defects, a directed verdict for the manufacturer was proper. Eversole v. Louisville Ladder Group, 2003<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 270</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 5, 2003).

Estate of Bigham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 462 F. Supp. 2d 766, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83701 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2006</cite>).

        Where a plaintiff was struck and injured by an automatic revolving door and where she presented expert testimony that the sensors on the door were inadequate, that additional sensors were needed to detect the presence of people and stop the door from moving, and that the door’s lack of adequate and sufficient sensors caused it to strike plaintiff and cause her injuries, plaintiff successfully rebutted the statutory presumption of non-defectiveness. Boon Edam, Inc. v. Saunders, 324 S.W.3d 422, 2010<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 191</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).

        Seller involved in a small claims action against the buyer, who sued it when the generator that the buyer purchased from the seller soon caught fire, could not show that a presumption of the Kentucky Products Liability Act (Act), contained in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.310ol12" target="_self">411.310(2)</a></cite>, applied. Since a small claims action was involved, that Act did not apply and, indeed, the simplified small claims procedure set forth in statutes such as KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc24As24A.200" target="_blank">24A.200</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc24As24A.300ol12" target="_blank">24A.300(2)</a></cite> governed such actions.

        It was entirely consistent with Kentucky law to instruct the jury that the presumption of nondefectiveness in a products liability case could be overcome only by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the product was defective.

        Unless a plaintiff in a products liability action can present something more than a conclusion that, with regard to the product in question, it was theoretically probable that a different design would have been feasible and would have prevented his injury, the issue of strict liability should not be submitted to the jury. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Rice, 775 S.W.2d 924, 1988<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 207</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).

        Where a plaintiff was struck and injured by an automatic revolving door and filed a products liability suit against the door’s manufacturer, the trial court did not err under KRE. 702 in finding that plaintiff’s expert was qualified to testify as an expert witness because his testimony helped the jury understand the limitations of the sensors in place on the door at issue, the apparent need for additional sensors, and the cause of plaintiff’s injuries. Further, the expert’s extensive knowledge, education, training, and professional experience qualified him as an expert. Boon Edam, Inc. v. Saunders, 324 S.W.3d 422, 2010<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Manufacturer was entitled to summary judgment on the patient’s strict liability claim because at the time of the patient’s surgery, there existed no published literature specifically correlating chondrolysis to the prescription implantable medical device, and therefore the manufacturer did not have a duty to warn the patient of the risk of chrondrolysis from the use of the device.

        The finding that building owner was 20% at fault for a second roof collapse within one (1) month due to defective construction, was a proportionate bar, rather than a complete bar, to his right of recovery which accrued in 1977.

        The undoubted intent of the legislature in passing the Products Liability Act was to restrict liability; thus subsection (3) of this section being clear and unambiguous, and its application according to its terms not yielding an absurd result, must be applied according to its plain meaning, and defendant’s motion for an instruction that contributory negligence is a complete bar in products liability action if supported by the evidence, must be granted. Anderson v. Black &amp; Decker, Inc., 597 F. Supp. 1298, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21679 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1984</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (3) of this section, by its plain meaning, provides that contributory negligence of a claimant which is a substantial cause of the occurrence that caused injury or damage to him is an absolute bar to recovery of damages resulting from such injury, and this subsection is not unconstitutional. Reda Pump Co., Div. of TRW, Inc. v. Finck, 713 S.W.2d 818, 1986<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 283</cite> (Ky. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A plaintiff’s contributory negligence that is a substantial cause of the damage to him or her will absolutely bar the plaintiff from recovering damages under a theory of strict product liability. Kanawha Steel &amp; Equipment Co. v. Dorsey Trailers, Inc., 662 F. Supp. 131, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4660 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1987</cite>), rev'd, 856 F.2d 780, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 12205 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1988</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a two-party products liability case, where the facts of the case raised a jury issue of whether or not the plaintiff was negligent, and whether such negligence was a substantial factor in causing his death (and perhaps would justify a directed verdict for the defendant), the court should have applied the principle of contributory negligence pursuant to this section and Reda Pump Co., Etc. v. Finck, 713 S.W.2d 818, 1986<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 283</cite> (Ky. 1986), rather than the principle of comparative negligence pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.182" target="_self">411.182</a></cite>. Koching v.

        The plaintiff failed to act in such a way as to contribute to the occurrence of the accident by altering the center bracket by applying repair welds, where, although there was testimony that the better course would have been to replace the center bracket, an expert testified that repair welding would be standard practice for an operation the size of the plaintiff’s, and the defendant did not warn against rewelding the center bracket.

        Where plaintiff was working his first day for an oil drilling company, and where he had been working for less than two (2) hours before his crew foreman asked him to ride a rotary head up to paint markers on a derrick, the jury should determine whether plaintiff exercised ordinary care for his own safety as would an ordinarily prudent oil rigger under like circumstances; thus, as plaintiff was an unknowledgeable user of the equipment in question, it cannot be said that he was necessarily negligent as a matter of law in riding on the rotary head.

      In any product liability action, if the manufacturer is identified and subject to the jurisdiction of the court, a wholesaler, distributor, or retailer who distributes or sells a product, upon his showing by a preponderance of the evidence that said product was sold by him in its original manufactured condition or package, or in the same condition such product was in when received by said wholesaler, distributor or retailer, shall not be liable to the plaintiff for damages arising solely from the distribution or sale of such product, unless such wholesaler, distributor or retailer, breached an express warranty or knew or should have known at the time of distribution or sale of such product that the product was in a defective condition, unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer.

        Where rental center was not a seller and the product in question was not in the same condition as when originally manufactured, this section did not provide a defense and the question of the liability of the original manufacturer, if any, was simply irrelevant. Burke Enterprises, Inc. v. Mitchell, 700 S.W.2d 789, 1985<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 290</cite> (Ky. 1985).

        Because transactions involving blood and blood components are considered services, as opposed to sales, they are outside the purview of this Commonwealth's Products Liability Act. McKee v.

        District Court denied the gun distributor’s motion for summary judgment where the court found that the manufacturer failed to prove that it was entitled to protection under Kentucky law. Koby v. Star Ammunition, Inc., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24310 (W.D. Ky. Dec. 19, 2001).

        Court rejected the consumers’ design defect claim against the retail store, finding that not only were the alleged defects open and obvious, but the sled contained a statement concerning the absence of a steering mechanism; so while a jury could have ultimately found that the sled was unreasonably dangerous, the consumers made no allegation that the retail store had any special knowledge to foresee such a danger. Weixler v. Paris Co., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 444 (W.D. Ky. Jan. 2, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs’
    motion to remand their product liability action to state court was granted because the non-diverse distributors of the dust respirators and masks at issue were not fraudulently joined; as the statutory language and Kentucky case law made clear, the defense of
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite> was not available under Kentucky law if there was a finding that the distributors “should have known” at the time of distribution or sale of a product that it was defective (whether the distributors had actual or constructive knowledge of any defects in the product was central to the merits of the case and was a question of fact to be resolved by a jury).
    Baker v. 3M, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27401 (E.D. Ky. May 26, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court, in an action where coal miners sued the manufacturers and the retailers of allegedly defective respirator masks, could not dismiss the retailers at any stage of the proceedings before any discovery was conducted merely because one retailer claimed in a self-serving affidavit that he was unaware of the dangers of the masks.
    Adams v. 3M, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27404 (E.D. Ky. Jan. 27, 2005).

       <p>
        Court granted summary judgment as to a manufacturer on an accident victim’s strict liability and negligence claims based on defective design or manufacture, pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite>, because expert testimony indicated that the most likely cause of a spray paint can explosion was fatigue caused by impacts on the bottom of the can. However, the court found that there was a jury issue concerning the adequacy of the warning on the can. Coleman v. Rust-Oleum Corp., 405 F. Supp. 2d 806, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33265 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2005</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        When plaintiff pled that the pharmacies knew or reasonably should have known that there was no indication warranting the long-term use of her prescribed medications and negligently failed to recognize the symptoms of her reaction to the medications, the allegations of negligence were inadequate to apply the second exception set forth in the Kentucky Middleman Statute, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite>, which applied when pharmacies knew or should have known at the time of sale that drugs were unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer. Smith v. Wyeth, Inc., 488 F. Supp. 2d 625, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34873 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2007</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Regardless of whether plaintiff’s allegations of negligence against pharmacies were intended to state a claim that, by preparing a dosage of a prescribed drug and providing it over a long-term basis, the pharmacies altered the condition of the drugs, such a claim was not adequately stated in the complaint when plaintiff alleged only that the pharmacies filled plaintiff’s prescription as it was presented to the pharmacies from health care providers. Plaintiff did not sufficiently allege in her complaint that the pharmacies altered the condition of the drugs. Smith v. Wyeth, Inc., 488 F. Supp. 2d 625, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34873 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2007</cite>).

       <p>
        Retailer that sold a tree stand which allegedly broke and caused the purchaser to fall to his death was not entitled to summary judgment in a product liability case where a question remained as to whether the retailer created an express warranty under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc355s355.2-313" target="_blank">355.2-313</a></cite> by advertising that it field-tested all of the products it sold before sending them to the customer; thus, a question remained as to whether the retailer was more than a mere seller for purposes of the Kentucky Middleman Statute, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite>. Morgan v. Cabela's Inc., 788 F. Supp. 2d 552, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22683 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2011</cite>).

        Where the distributor could not satisfy the requirements relating to middlemen in products liability cases set forth in this section, there was no immunity from liability, and the trial court correctly denied application of the statute as a defense. Worldwide Equip. v. Mullins, 11 S.W.3d 50, 1999<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 34</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1999).

        Where the injured party, who suffered from a liver condition, became sick after eating raw oysters due to a bacteria commonly and naturally found in raw oysters, the restaurant owner was not entitled to summary judgment pursuant to RCr 56 in the injured party’s strict products liability action; KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite> did not bar strict liability against the restaurant owner, as a jury could have found that raw oysters unaccompanied by a manufacturer’s warning of the serious health risks to certain people were defective. Edwards v. Hop Sin, Inc., 140 S.W.3d 13, 2003<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 213</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lessor who purchased a scissor lift and leased it to a company was not liable to a company employee who was injured while using the lift because the lessor was immune from the employee’s strict liability and negligence claims for defective design under Kentucky’s Middleman Statute, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite>; the lift was not altered by the lessor, there was no allegation that the lessor breached an express warranty, and none of the employee’s evidence proved that the lessor knew or should have known of a design defect Smith v. Leveelift, Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22895 (E.D. Ky. Oct. 6, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both requirements of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite> were satisfied where the manufacturer of the table at issue had been identified and was a party to the action, and all testimony indicated that no alterations were made to the table, and the table in fact was shipped directly to the contracting employer. Franke v. Ford Motor Co., 398 F. Supp. 2d 833, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26259 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2005</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the product supplier was responsible under the terms of its agreement with the contracting employer for verifying that the product manufacturer made the contractor’s requested changes, then the supplier would not be immune under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite>. Franke v. Ford Motor Co., 398 F. Supp. 2d 833, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26259 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2005</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable jury could find that lift table supplier was responsible for ensuring compliance with the requested changes to the lift table, and if the resulting breach of an express warranty or the resulting sale of an unreasonably dangerous product caused injury, that would place the supplier outside the scope of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite>, which was designed to protect only those distributors, wholesalers, or retailers, who have no independent responsibility over the design or manufacture of a product. Franke v. Ford Motor Co., 398 F. Supp. 2d 833, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26259 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2005</cite>).

       <p>
        Where the Kentucky Middleman Statute,
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite>, did not render the distributors and retailers of the allegedly defective respirators “fraudulent” parties to the coal miner’s suit, the court held that remanding the case filed by a coal miner who claimed that certain respirators caused coal dust to enter his lungs, resulting in black lung disease, back to state court was the proper measure.
    Adams v. 3M, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29007 (E.D. Ky. Nov. 21, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        When plaintiff pled that the pharmacies had a duty to warn her of the effects of prescribed drugs but failed to allege that an express or implied warranty was made that the drugs were fit for her use, plaintiff could not utilize the first exception set out in the Kentucky Middleman Statute, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite>, for breach of an express warranty. Thus, plaintiff’s claims against the pharmacies were barred. Smith v. Wyeth, Inc., 488 F. Supp. 2d 625, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34873 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2007</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff could not seek to recover against distributor under apparent manufacturer doctrine because Kentucky had not recognized that doctrine’s applicability to suits in the Commonwealth, and the court did not predict that a Kentucky court would do so if given the opportunity as it could not peacefully exist with Kentucky’s “middleman” statute, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.340" target="_self">411.340</a></cite>.

Further, the most likely cause of the explosion of the can was low cycle bending fatigue caused by impacts on the bottom of the can. Coleman v. Rust-Oleum Corp., 405 F. Supp. 2d 806, 2005 U.S. Dist.

        Nuisances are that class of wrongs which arise from the unreasonable, unwarranted, or unlawful use by a person of his own property and produce such material annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort, or hurt to others that the law will presume a consequential damage. Fletcher v. Tenneco, Inc., 816 F. Supp. 1186, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21559 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1993</cite>), op. withdrawn, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3054 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 22, 1993).

        Where property owners alleged that contamination from a uranium enrichment facility interfered with the use and enjoyment of property and decreased their property values, their nuisance claim survived summary judgment because they were not required to show that the contamination constituted a health hazard and they demonstrated a sufficient physical invasion of their property to raise a factual dispute. Smith v. Carbide &amp; Chems. Corp., 507 F.3d 372, 2007 FED App. 0438P, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 25644 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2007</cite>).

        Where no Kentucky caselaw considered the issue of whether private nuisance should be extended to allow recovery between subsequent landowners of the same parcel, the court held that, were a Kentucky court to consider the issue, it would follow the lead of the majority of the courts, which had consistently rejected allowing a subsequent landowner to recover in private nuisance from a prior landowner.

       <p>
        Because the court believed that a Kentucky court would not recognize a cause of action in private nuisance between subsequent landowners of the same land, a regional airport authority was not entitled to relief in the form of damages for private nuisance against a previous property owner. Reg'l Airport Auth. v. LFG, LLC., 255 F. Supp. 2d 688, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5272 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2003</cite>).

        A regional airport authority could not use the theory of private nuisance under Kentucky law to attempt to recover the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination against the prior owner of the parcel of land.

        Where a regional airport authority (RAA) acquired real property as part of an airport project, then sued the prior landowner to recover the cost of cleaning up environmental contamination under a public nuisance theory, among other claims, although the RAA alleged the threatened and actual release of contaminants into the environment, it did not allege that such release occurred in a public place, or threatened the public in any way, and thus did not state a claim for public nuisance.

        Plaintiff property owners’
    private nuisance claim failed because they failed to show causation as their expert’s test results did not show that vinyl chloride, the emissions of which allegedly caused a noxious order, was present in sufficient levels to meet the odor thresholds and independent government documentation provided also failed to establish causation. Even assuming that causation was proven, the owners failed to demonstrate harm from the emissions by demonstrating a material reduction in fair market value or rental value of their properties as required by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.560" target="_self">411.560</a></cite>.

        In property owners’ class suit for personal injuries from the operation of swine barns on nearby property, the barn operators were entitled to summary judgment on permanent nuisance claims against all class members who moved into the class area after the second barn went into operation because these owners could not establish damages. Powell v. Tosh, 929 F. Supp. 2d 691, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32229 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2013</cite>).

        Commonality prerequisite was lacking in this nuisance action because while some plaintiffs did claim to have experienced substantial annoyance and/or an interference, some clearly did not, making this element of liability incapable of being resolved by common answer.

        The District Court found that, as a matter of law, the contamination of plaintiffs’ land by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a substance widely accepted as hazardous, constituted a condition that would substantially annoy or interfere with the use and enjoyment of property by a person of ordinary sensitivity.

        Whether a nuisance exists is determined on the basis of two (2) factors: the reasonableness of the defendant’s use of his property, and the gravity of harm to the plaintiff. Fletcher v. Tenneco, Inc., 816 F. Supp. 1186, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21559 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1993</cite>), op. withdrawn, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3054 (E.D. Ky. Feb. 22, 1993).

        Although residents met the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) for a proposed class settlement of nuisance and negligence claims against owners and lessees of a nearby chemical manufacturing facility, an injunction purporting to bind non-parties was unfair and beyond the court’s power to enforce under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2); however, the decision to aggregate the settlement proceeds in a scholarship fund for the benefit of current and future residents was reasonable because the only realistic claims sounded in nuisance under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.550" target="_self">411.550</a></cite> and<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.560" target="_self">411.560(</a></cite>3) and the residents tendered no reliable evidence of lost property value.

        Where property owners alleged that contamination from a uranium enrichment facility interfered with the use and enjoyment of property and decreased their property values, their nuisance claim survived summary judgment because they were not required to show that the contamination constituted a health hazard and they demonstrated a sufficient physical invasion of their property to raise a factual dispute.

        In property owners’ class suit for injuries suffered from the operation of swine barns on nearby property, the barn operators were entitled to summary judgment on a temporary nuisance claim because the owners did not show a material issue of fact as to whether the nuisance could be altered at a reasonable expense to eliminate the offending condition.

        Plaintiff property owners’
    private nuisance claim failed because they failed to show causation as their expert’s test results did not show that vinyl chloride, the emissions of which allegedly caused a noxious order, was present in sufficient levels to meet the odor thresholds and independent government documentation provided also failed to establish causation. Even assuming that causation was proven, the owners failed to demonstrate harm from the emissions by demonstrating a material reduction in fair market value or rental value of their properties as required by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.560" target="_self">411.560</a></cite>.

        Commonality prerequisite was lacking in this nuisance action because there could be no liability for permanent nuisance where a claimant had not suffered a material reduction in the fair market value of his property, let alone suffered no reduction whatsoever.

        This section, while abrogating the common-law rule that where the wrong is a mere act of negligence involving no moral turpitude there may be contribution among parties in pari delicto, made no change in the exception which allows the right of indemnity where the person seeking it and the person from whom it is sought are not in pari delicto, as where the party who was compelled to pay the damages was less culpable than the other wrongdoer, although both were equally liable to the person injured. Brown Hotel Co. v. Pittsburgh Fuel Co., 311<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.34.html#tXXXIVc396" target="_blank">Ky. 396</a></cite>, 224 S.W.2d 165, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        The right of an indemnitor to be subrogated to the rights and remedies of his principal whose liability he has satisfied stands entirely upon principles of equity and is not derived from this section. Silver Fleet Motor Express, Inc. v. Zody, 43 F. Supp. 459, 1942 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3230 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1942</cite>).

         4. Theory of Contribution.
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The doctrine of contribution is based upon common liability to the injured party. Employers Mut. Liability Ins. Co. v. Griffin Constr. Co., 280 S.W.2d 179, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 138</cite> (Ky. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        The theory of contribution is that a party required to pay more than his pro rata share of a common liability to an injured party has a right of recovery for one half (1/2) the amount paid against a joint tortfeasor in pari delicto, that is, one equally at fault from the standpoint of concurring negligence of substantially the same character, but, on the other hand, a right to total indemnity may exist if the joint tortfeasors are not in pari delicto and the party secondarily negligent asserts a claim against the one primarily negligent. Lexington Country Club v. Stevenson, 390 S.W.2d 137, 1965<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 332</cite> (Ky. 1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the doctrine of contribution, the liability of each joint tortfeasor is equal and is not apportioned on the basis of causation whereas if the trier of fact chooses to apportion its award among the joint tortfeasors, each tortfeasor is liable only for the amount apportioned against it by the trier of fact; therefore by reserving the issue of contribution in the judgment of July 3, the trial court did not expressly indicate that the question of apportionment was also reserved. Ohio River Pipeline Corp. v. Landrum, 580 S.W.2d 713, 1979<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 398</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires only that both parties be “wrongdoers” whose “negligence” contributed to cause the injury, not that both be legally liable to the injured person. Burrell v. Electric Plant Bd., 676 S.W.2d 231, 1984<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 207</cite> (Ky. 1984), overruled,
    Dix &amp; Assoc. Pipeline Contractors, Inc. v. Key, 799 S.W.2d 24, 1990<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 107</cite> (Ky. 1990).

        Where contract between manufacturing company and railroad imposed upon railroad primary duty of guarding crossing leading into manufacturer’s premises, the railroad was active wrongdoer with respect to accident liability at crossing and could not enforce contribution from manufacturing company against whom the person injured had no cause of action. Chesapeake &amp; O. R. Co. v. Clayton &amp; Lambert Mfg. Co., 188 F.2d 68, 1951 U.S. App. LEXIS 2968 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1951</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The indemnitor having discharged liability of principal succeeds to all rights and remedies principal had to enforce contribution, from wherever derived, and in this respect no distinction is made between compensated and gratuitous indemnitors. Silver Fleet Motor Express, Inc. v. Zody, 43 F. Supp. 459, 1942 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3230 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1942</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        If two (2) joint tortfeasors are equally guilty, or in pari delicto, then each is fully responsible to the injured person but between themselves each is responsible for only half by virtue of this section. Miller v. Hammary Furniture Co., 299 F. Supp. 238, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8517 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1969</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury’s finding that the negligence was equal brought this section into effect so that if one defendant paid plaintiff more than half the assessed damages, he could seek contribution from the other tortfeasor, but the plaintiff was not denied his right to seek satisfaction of the entire judgment from any defendant. Miller v. Hammary Furniture Co., 299 F. Supp. 238, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8517 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1969</cite>).

        A joint tortfeasor cannot enforce contribution from another against whom the injured person had no cause of action. Consolidated Coach Corp. v. Burge, 245<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 631</cite>, 54 S.W.2d 16, 1932<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 649</cite> (Ky. 1932).

       <p>
        Master and servant could be joined in an action in tort and treated as joint tortfeasors for all purposes and the master’s right to contribution from servant was preserved where master’s only responsibility was under doctrine of respondeat superior. Sherwood v. Huber &amp; Huber Motor Exp. Co., 286<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 775</cite>, 151 S.W.2d 1007, 1941<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 329</cite> (Ky. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since an employer operating under the workers’ compensation act cannot be a joint tortfeasor with a third party who injures his employee, there can be no right of contribution by employer. Employers Mut. Liability Ins. Co. v. Griffin Constr. Co., 280 S.W.2d 179, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 138</cite> (Ky. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        The workers’ compensation act extinguishes the liability of employer to employee for negligence of the former and consequently there can be no common liability of the employer with a third party. Employers Mut. Liability Ins. Co. v. Griffin Constr. Co., 280 S.W.2d 179, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 138</cite> (Ky. 1955).

       <p>
        Where the careless conduct of employee of junkyard in casting can of burning gasoline onto an invitee was the direct cause of the injury, the employer, who had paid in full judgment obtained by invitee against employer and employee, could maintain an action under this section for contribution against employee. Phelps v. Brown, 295 S.W.2d 804, 1956<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 183</cite> (Ky. 1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        A verdict in such proportion as the participation of the respective defendants in the tortious act is authorized under the statute and is conclusive and a defendant who was held nine-tenths negligent could not recover one-half contribution from his joint tortfeasor. Elpers v. Kimbel, 366 S.W.2d 157, 1963<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 5</cite> (Ky. 1963).

        The Commonwealth was negligent in failing to put up a guardrail and curve sign at a sharp curve, and driver’s insurer was entitled to contribution of $7,000 from it as joint tortfeasor, that being one half (1/2) of the payment insurer made in settlement of claim for death of passenger in driver’s truck; Commonwealth’s liability was not limited to one half (1/2) of the $10,000 limit of its statutory liability.

        In an action by insurance carrier for contribution, the conflict in the testimony as to how far defendant’s station wagon extended over the hard surface of the highway, the preponderance being that it completely blocked the west lane of traffic, was a question for the jury.

        This section necessarily implies that even if action is successful and entitles plaintiff to allowance for attorney, such allowance must be paid out of, and only to extent of, “funds recovered,” and hence, where there was no recovery, there could be no allowance. Gernert v. Liberty Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 284<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 575</cite>, 145 S.W.2d 522, 1940<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 544</cite> (Ky. 1940).

        As a general rule, an attorney who renders services in recovering a fund in which numerous parties are interested is entitled to a fee out of the fund.

        This section had no application to petition of attorneys for plaintiff for allowances to be paid out of funds received as proceeds from the sale of property in receivership as they were entitled to fees in an amount to be fixed by the court on the basis of the general equity power of court.

        In proceedings in connection with decedent’s estate, where determination of rights of parties, collection of rentals due estate, allotment of dower, and sale of property all were involved, trial court properly ordered that portion of widow’s attorney fee be paid out of estate as against contention of executor that attorney’s services were primarily for benefit of widow and only indirectly of benefit to the estate.

        Estate was not benefited but services were rendered solely for heir’s benefit and heir was not entitled to charge any part of her costs, fees or expenses incurred in unsuccessfully resisting a claim of administrator’s daughter and son-in-law against her father’s estate, to the estate where the administrator, who was her brother, was in favor of paying the claim, but heir objected and, on heir’s motion to remove administrator, court ordered administrator to defend the claim, which was more than the estate, and, contrary to the court order, administrator was represented by his own attorney, offered no affirmative defense and testified in favor of claimants leaving the brunt of the defense to be carried by the heir and her attorney.

        Although approximately two (2) years had elapsed between appointment of administrator and filing of equitable suit against him for settlement of estate, there was no showing of unreasonable delay on the part of the administrator and the major portion of the assets had been distributed so the action was fruitless and wholly unnecessary and chancellor correctly denied the claim of plaintiff for expenses of prosecuting the action.

        Grandchild who intervened in a declaratory judgment action to challenge an agreed settlement judgment was not required to pay the attorney who represented his father in the settlement a percentage of his share of an inheritance as attorney fees. The attorney did not perform any services for the grandchild, and it appeared that it was unintentional on the attorney’s part that the grandchild benefited at all from the terms of the settlement agreement.

     Action by surety who pays, against principal — Against cosurety.
      </span>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a surety pays any part of a debt or liability for which he is bound as surety, he may recover the amount, with interest from time of payment, from the principal by action at law or by motion, after ten (10) days’ notice in writing. He may also sue a cosurety, separately or as a joint defendant with the principal, in such proceeding, and in like manner recover judgment against him, separately or jointly, at the same time, for his proper part of the debt or liability so paid, as if the sureties were the sole obligors. If one (1) or more of several cosureties is insolvent, or resides out of the state, the recovery against the solvent and resident sureties shall also be for a proper part of the share of liability pertaining to the insolvent or nonresident surety. If the surety afterwards makes further payment on the debt or liability, he may again have like remedy therefor. But nothing in this section shall preclude the party sued from making any defense that might have been made against the original demand, unless the payment was made after and in consequence of a judgment in an action of which he had notice.

       <p>
        Upon motion for reimbursement, the principal could plead any defense that would have been available to him in a common-law action. Tennell v. Dozier, 3<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc47" target="_blank">Ky. 47</a></cite> (Ky. 1806) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a surety who had paid the debt released a cosurety, the liability of the principal for reimbursement was not affected. Crowdus v. Shelby, 29<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61" target="_blank">Ky. 61</a></cite>, 1831<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 126</cite> (Ky. 1831) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The liability of the principal to his surety could not exceed the amount paid on the debt by the surety. Hickman v. McCurdy, 30<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 555</cite>, 1832<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 145</cite> (Ky. 1832) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for reimbursement, the surety might show payment in any medium equivalent to money. Stone v. Porter, 34<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc207" target="_blank">Ky. 207</a></cite>, 1836<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 54</cite> (Ky. 1836).

       </p>
       <p>
        A surety on the note of a partner executed to obtain funds for the partnership might have had reimbursement from the partnership. Burns &amp; McConnoughy v. Parish, 42<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc08" target="_blank">Ky. 8</a></cite>, 1842<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 84</cite> (Ky. 1842) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        A surety who had been released could not thereafter pay the debt and require the principal to reimburse him. Kimble v. Cummins, 60<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc327" target="_blank">Ky. 327</a></cite>, 1860<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 85</cite> (Ky. 1860) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The petition of a surety relying on implied assumpsit alleging that he was surety, the payment of the money by him to the obligee, and the failure to pay by the defendant stated a good cause of action. Bridges v. Reed, 72<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc329" target="_blank">Ky. 329</a></cite>, 1872<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        The right to reimbursement is barred in five (5) years in the absence of a prior assignment of or subrogation to the creditors’ rights. Duke v. Pigman, 110<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 756</cite>, 62 S.W. 867, 23<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 209</cite>, 1901<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 138</cite> (Ky. 1901). See Patton's Ex'r v.

       </p>
       <p>
        As between principal and sureties, the principal alone is bound for the whole of it. Sanders &amp; Walker v. Herndon, 122<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 760</cite>, 93 S.W. 14, 29<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 322</cite>, 1906<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 101</cite> (Ky. 1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        A surety paying a judgment may proceed against his principal by motion even though the judgment has not been assigned to him. Davis v. Kinnard, 271<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc428" target="_blank">Ky. 428</a></cite>, 112 S.W.2d 412, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 256</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section limits the surety’s right of recovery to the amount paid by him in satisfaction of the principal’s obligation, even where the surety takes an assignment of the obligation and sues the principal thereon. Napier v. Duff, 281<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 779</cite>, 136 S.W.2d 1083, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 38</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where insolvent bank applied surety’s deposit to pay note of principal, surety’s right of indemnity extended only to the actual value of the deposit so applied, as determined by the percentage paid by the bank in liquidating dividends to its depositors, and not the face amount of the note. Napier v. Duff, 281<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 779</cite>, 136 S.W.2d 1083, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 38</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        A surety who has been compelled by judgment to pay his principal’s obligation has the right to obtain a judgment against principal by a motion after due service of process. Grubbs v. Slater, 266 S.W.2d 85, 1953<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1276</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where principal merely objected to the filing of an unverified motion by surety for a judgment against principal in an action by creditor against principal and surety wherein surety had been compelled to pay principal’s debt instead of requesting a rule to require proper verification of the pleading, his failure to require verification waived any complaint he might have had and the failure to verify did not render the filing invalid. Grubbs v. Slater, 266 S.W.2d 85, 1953<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1276</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a litigant pays an adverse judgment, he does not thereby impair his right to appeal, nor may a surety be required to elect between an appeal and the enforcement of any derivative right he may have against the principal; thus, where surety has paid the recovery rendered against him and then under this section has recovered such sum from the principal, he may still appeal the adverse judgment. Moss v. Smith, 361 S.W.2d 511, 1962<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 244</cite> (Ky. 1962).

        The notice and motion could be joint in form, although the liability was several. Lampton v. Bruner, 12<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc141" target="_blank">Ky. 141</a></cite>, 1822<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 185</cite> (Ky. 1822) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        The surety’s property was sold under execution to his father-in-law who before his death devised it to the surety’s wife for life. These facts did not exonerate the cosurety from making contribution. Caldwell v. Roberts, 31<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc355" target="_blank">Ky. 355</a></cite>, 1833<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 88</cite> (Ky. 1833) (decided under prior law).

        When two (2) of the four (4) creditor plaintiffs indemnified one (1) of the debtor’s two (2) sureties, said indemnifying plaintiffs could be enjoined by the unindemnified surety from collecting from him the amount due them under the decree. Johnson v. Givens, 60<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc91" target="_blank">Ky. 91</a></cite>, 1860<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        In equity contribution is based on the principle of distributing a common burden among those who are able to bear it. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The principles of contribution are not affected by the fact that one (1) surety had signed three (3) bonds and the other only one. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v.

        A paying surety is not deprived of his right to contribution by having granted time to the insolvent principal in which to reimburse him or by having taken a new covenant from him for reimbursement.

       <p>
        At law, contribution is based on an implied contract. Vansant's Ex'x v. Gardner's Ex'x, 240<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc318" target="_blank">Ky. 318</a></cite>, 42 S.W.2d 300, 1931<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 380</cite> (Ky. 1931).

        A mere request by a surety to another to sign with him is presumably a request to be bound equally. But the rule is otherwise if there is a definite contract as to a different liability or if the second surety signs for the benefit of the first. Vansant's Ex'x v. Gardner's Ex'x, 240<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc318" target="_blank">Ky. 318</a></cite>, 42 S.W.2d 300, 1931<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 380</cite> (Ky. 1931).

        Except as to the relative liability between the sureties, a defendant in a suit for contribution is bound by the judgment in the suit on the original obligation when he has participated therein.

        Government contractor was entitled to accounting of surety’s transaction under government contract and was entitled to any amounts retained by surety in excess of surety’s loss even though surety did undertake a substantial new risk by contracting directly with the government to complete contractor’s contract, for surety’s choice must be exercised consistent with its fiduciary duties to contractor; the principle limiting a surety’s right against loss, forecloses a surety’s right to profit on a new assignment from the obligee.

        Where contractor who had government contract paid consideration to surety for assuming duty to guarantee performance of contract, once surety became obligated to and did perform under the bond it was still acting as surety and remained entitled only to an amount occasioned in the event of its loss or expense; its rights to any profit pursuant to a takeover agreement entered into with government was of no consequence to the suretyship; surety realized its gain in the form of premiums paid at the onset of the contract for suretyship and as surety held other amounts in excess of its liability as a fiduciary for the benefit of contractor, for to hold otherwise would bestow upon surety an undeserved windfall gain.

     <p>
      If the surety pays any part of a judgment he shall have a right to an assignment of the judgment from the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney, in whole or in part. When the plaintiff has been fully satisfied, the assignment shall give the surety the right to sue out or use any existing execution or otherwise control the judgment for his own benefit, against the other defendants, so far as to obtain satisfaction from the principal for the whole amount so paid by him, with interest, or from any cosurety his proper part of such payment, according to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc412s412.080" target="_self">412.080</a></cite>. This assignment shall also transfer to the sureties so paying the benefit of any lien existing under or by virtue of the judgment, and the right of assignment shall exist, though the money was made or secured by sale of the property of the surety under execution.

In any joint suit against the whole, or separate suit against him, judgment shall be rendered against him separately, and only for such proper share. The written notice required in this section shall not be waived, unless the waiver is in writing. No waiver of the notice shall be pleaded as a defense or given in evidence, unless it is in writing.

        A payee and first indorser of a bill of exchange was liable to the second indorser, who took up the bill, for the full amount of the bill, unless there was an agreement for a different degree of responsibility; such an action was substantially an action by a surety against his principal to obtain indemnity against the debt for which he was liable. Scott v. Doneghy, 56<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc321" target="_blank">Ky. 321</a></cite>, 1856<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Where a father signed a son’s note as surety and a judgment was obtained against both and execution levied against the father’s real estate which was partitioned between the son and the father’s other heirs on the father’s death, the other heirs could maintain an action to have son’s portion of the property sold to satisfy the lien on all the property and, since the land descended to the son with a lien upon it, he had no homestead as against the lien.

        In an action by the administrator of a decedent and the present guardian of an infant, of whom the decedent was guardian at the time of his death, against a surety on the guardian’s bond, cross action by the surety, seeking to recover for the ward part of a trust fund belonging to the estate of the ward, which had been wrongfully received, was not one against cosureties for contribution but an action against the insolvent estate of a deceased principal and others, who are quasi principals, having in their hands, impliedly in trust, funds of the cestui qui trust, and relief sought was property allowed. In order to maintain such action, surety need not have discharged the debt. Taylor v. Harris' Adm'r, 164<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 654</cite>, 176 S.W. 168, 1915<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        A grantee in a deed who assumes the payment of a debt of the grantor secured by a mortgage on the property conveyed becomes the principal and the grantor becomes the surety; therefore, when grantee defaults in payment, the grantor cannot maintain a suit against the grantee for the amount due without himself having paid the debt and, if the property is sold at foreclosure sale, the grantor cannot sue grantee for a deficiency unless grantor actually pays the deficiency. White v. Upton, 255<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 562</cite>, 74 S.W.2d 924, 1934<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 261</cite> (Ky. 1934).

        As between sureties, a discharge of their joint obligation by the acceptance in lieu of it, by the holder, of the promissory note of one of them was equivalent to a payment of money therefor and the surety who paid the obligation could maintain an action against his cosurety for contribution. Stubbins v. Mitchell, 82<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 535</cite>, 6<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 491</cite>, 6<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        In an action instituted by a surety against his cosurety, to pay an obligation for which they were jointly liable, in which it was averred that the defendant had transferred property to his son, the only consideration being love and affection, after process was served upon him, the court determined that such a conveyance as to antecedent creditors of the donor was fraudulent and without sufficient consideration.

        In an action against two (2) sureties on a note, one surety against whom judgment went for the whole amount, after satisfying it, may maintain an equitable action against his cosurety for contribution or he may proceed at law by cross petition.

        One joint obligor may maintain an action in equity to require another to pay to the creditor the portion of the debt which, as between themselves, the other ought to equitably pay, but he cannot recover a judgment, in his own name and for himself, for any portion of the debt, which he has not himself first paid.

        In an action by the payee on a note against the payor and sureties, the payee on proper allegations would have been entitled to subrogation to the rights of the sureties under a note and mortgage given them by the payor, but the sureties were not entitled to judgment on their note in the absence of an allegation that they paid the plaintiff on the original note.

        Under this section the creditor must be made a defendant in an action by a surety against his principal to foreclose a mortgage to satisfy indebtedness paid by surety but, where the question of defect of parties was not raised in the proper way and at the proper time and the creditors subsequently became parties and filed their answers and cross petitions setting up their claims and electing to take their share of the proceeds, the failure to make them parties was necessarily cured.

        It was not error, being not only permissible but eminently proper, for Circuit Court to allow plaintiffs to file an amended petition just before submission of the cause to cure defects and perfect the cause of action allowed by this section and also to make pleadings conform to the proof in an action to recover judgment for an indebtedness it was claimed defendant owed them which involved a settlement of all matters of account between them, including payment as maker of certain past-due notes upon which plaintiffs were sureties and to enforce for that purpose the mortgage given plaintiffs by defendant as security.

        Where three (3) sureties were bound and two (2) of them had taken a mortgage from the principal to indemnify them against the debt and other liabilities and one of them paid the debt and brought assumpsit against the third surety, who had no indemnity, for his third part, the action could not be maintained without showing that the mortgaged property had been properly disposed of without having satisfied the debt for which contribution was demanded.

        A security given by a principal to his surety is a security for the debt, as well as ultimate protection of the surety, and operates for the benefit of the creditor so that after maturity of the debt the creditor may be subrogated to the rights of the surety therein, either on his own application or that of the surety.

        Money paid by a surety was, prima facie, deemed to have been paid to the use of the principal obligor, and the liability of a cosurety was altogether contingent, depending on the insolvency of the principal.

        In an action against representatives of the plaintiff’s cosurety for a judgment for money paid for their principal, the court, in dismissing the complaint, stated that an action could not be maintained by one surety against a cosurety unless the principal was insolvent, and the failure of the petition to allege such insolvency rendered it fatally defective.

        It is a well-established policy of this state to fix in every case a limit of time for bringing actions or proceedings for relief. Foster v. Jordan, 130<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc445" target="_blank">Ky. 445</a></cite>, 113 S.W. 490, 1908<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 290</cite> (Ky. 1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute of limitations is intended to close the door of the courts to the bringing of suits on stale claims and is intended to be used as a blanket to smother any faint respiration of moribund claims of plaintiffs in regular causes of action or those of defendants asserted by counterclaim. Liter v. Hoagland, 305<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc329" target="_blank">Ky. 329</a></cite>, 204 S.W.2d 219, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Unless equitable relief is sought, the statute of limitation fixes the limit and establishes the applicable principle. State Mut. Life Assurance Co. v. Heine, 141 F.2d 741, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 3786 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1944</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The repeal of a statute of limitation cannot act retrospectively so as to disturb rights acquired thereunder so the repeal of a provision in a city charter that a right of action against the city was barred by six-month limitation did not revive the right of action under the general statute of limitation. Lawrence v. Louisville, 96<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 595</cite>, 29 S.W. 450, 16<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 672</cite>, 1895<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 131</cite> (Ky. 1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a statute of limitation is repealed, a new statute substituted therefor applies to an action thereafter brought upon a cause of action as to which the bar of the old statute was not complete when it was repealed. Fish v. Genett, 56 S.W. 813, 22<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 177</cite>, 1900<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 442</cite> (Ky. 1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Our limitation laws are statutes of repose. Foster v. Jordan, 130<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc445" target="_blank">Ky. 445</a></cite>, 113 S.W. 490, 1908<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 290</cite> (Ky. 1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Limitation is entirely a matter of statute and the statute that creates a bar may provide an exception to the statute. Knight's Adm'r v. Illinois C. R. Co., 143<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc418" target="_blank">Ky. 418</a></cite>, 136 S.W. 874, 1911<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 423</cite> (Ky. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        Periods of limitations are graduated mainly with reference to the nature and quality of the evidence by which the contract must be established. Homire v. Stratton &amp; Terstegge Co., 157<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 822</cite>, 164 S.W. 67, 1914<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 367</cite> (Ky. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is competent for the Legislature to change the period of limitations as to all claims not already barred and in doing so it may give the statute a retrospective effect provided that it does not impair the obligation of a contract or a vested right; yet it cannot remove a bar of limitation which has already become complete and no limitation shall be made affecting existing claims without allowing a reasonable time for parties to bring actions before their claims are absolutely barred by the new statute. Heath v. Hazelip, 159<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 555</cite>, 167 S.W. 905, 1914<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 851</cite> (Ky. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, by the enactment of a new statute, the period of limitation is shortened before a cause of action is barred, the reasonable time thereafter in which an action may be brought thereon is to be determined by the court in which it is instituted but in no event should it be extended beyond the length of time in which the action could have been brought under the old statute, nor to exceed the time allowed by the new statute. Heath v. Hazelip, 159<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 555</cite>, 167 S.W. 905, 1914<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 851</cite> (Ky. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a statute creates a new legal liability, with a right to a suit for its enforcement, provided the suit is brought within a designated period, the time within which a suit must be brought operates as a limitation of the liability itself as created and not of the remedy alone. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Tafel Electric Co., 262<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 792</cite>, 91 S.W.2d 42, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 798</cite> (Ky. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutes of limitation are construed strictly and the court will not read into them exemptions which are not expressly put there. Newby's Adm'r v. Warren's Adm'r, 277<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc338" target="_blank">Ky. 338</a></cite>, 126 S.W.2d 436, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 648</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the object rather than the form of action which controls in determining the limitation period. Carr v. Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 344 S.W.2d 619, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 243</cite> (Ky. 1961).

        The statute of limitations applies to all actions, whether at law or in equity, and the chancellor can exercise no discretion on the subject but must apply the statute when properly pleaded although the jurisdiction over the subject matter belongs exclusively to a court of equity. Hargis v. Sewell's Adm'r, 87<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc63" target="_blank">Ky. 63</a></cite>, 7 S.W. 557, 9<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        While the five-year statute of limitations would have barred abutting property owner’s cause of action for damages had the railroad constructed only one (1) track as authorized by the legislative and municipal authorities, where the railroad constructed two (2) tracks, it was an unlawful taking of the abutting property owner’s property to which the 15-year statute of limitations applied as of the time the unauthorized track was constructed and damaged the abutting property.

        Since persons claiming under a patent, in one call of which there is a mistake, may have the patent boundary run so as to include the tract claimed without reforming the patent as to such call, a suit by them to quiet their title is not barred by the fact that the statute of limitations has run against the right to have the patent reformed.

The statute applies to the cause of action, the case presented by the plaintiff, and whether a particular case is embraced by the statute is to be determined by ascertaining whether it is included in the causes of action to which the statute is made applicable; and neither the form of the proceeding nor the name by which it may be called can have any influence on the question whether the statute applies.

        Where judgment creditors did not bring an action until 1911 to recover a lot deeded to them in an equitable action in 1881 and the wife of the judgment debtor had a dower interest in the lot until her death in 1905, the right of action to recover possession of her undivided one third (1/3)did not accrue until her death and the plea of statute of limitations did not present a good defense as to it, although the plea presented a good defense to the recovery of the other undivided two thirds (3/4) of the lot.

        In an action to recover and have dower rights assigned which action was commenced within 15 years of execution of a deed of the unassigned dower rights by a married woman in the land of her first husband after she was married to her second husband and without the joinder of her second husband, the defense of limitation was unavailable to the grantee since the deed was void and the grantor’s right of entry arose upon execution of the deed and her cause of action arose simultaneously with her right of entry and it would have required 15 years’ possession by grantee to ripen his title even against one who was laboring under no disability.

        An action filed in 1920 by three (3) children of an adopted daughter of an intestate who died in 1897, their mother having predeceased her adopted father in 1895, was not barred as to any of the heirs by the 15 year statute of limitations where two (2) heirs alone were laboring under the disability of infancy when the cause of action arose upon partition of the land among intestate’s blood children in 1901, 1902, or 1903, which disability was removed in 1904 and 1909, respectively, and the third child of the adopted daughter was under the disability of coverture, having been married at the age of 17 in 1899 at the time the cause of action accrued and still was in 1920 at the time the suit was brought and had been at all times after 1899.

        The general rule of construction that when a trustee holds the legal title to real estate which is barred by the statute of limitations, the equitable interests dependent upon it will also be defeated, notwithstanding the cestui que trust is an infant, applies, where the trustee has joined in the conveyance under which the vendee claims, and estops the trustee from any proceeding to recover; thus, where trustee sold land in which mother had a life estate and infant children were remaindermen and the vendee held adversely to the trustee and cestui que trust for 32 years, the children were barred by the statute of limitations, regardless of when the life estate terminated.

        In an action of ejectment by remaindermen where grantee of life tenant set up defense of adverse possession, the 15-year statute of limitations began to run against all remaindermen immediately upon the death of the life tenant under a well-established rule that where part of the heirs are of full age and not under disability at the time the right of entry descends to them, the disability of the others does not prevent the statute from running against all, but if all of the cotenants to whom the right of action descends be under disability at the time the right of action accrues, the statute does not start running until the disability is removed from all, even the youngest.

Const. of 1891, continuing as valid all rights and actions not inconsistent therewith, was intended to and does continue as valid the right already accrued to a defendant of pleading the bar of a statute of limitations as a defense to an action.

        Where action was based on constructive trust growing out of conversion of chattel mortgage, plea that chattel mortgage was barred by limitations did not constitute a good defense, since action was not one to recover on the chattel mortgage as such.

        Where the defense of statute of limitations was never pleaded by defendant and was raised for the first time on appeal, during the oral argument, the defense was not properly raised and was not a bar to plaintiff’s action.

        The plea of statute of limitations must be based upon date when original claim was filed and not on date when the proceedings were continued in the form of a new suit under order of the trial court which order, according to the affidavit of the trial judge, was to have the same effect as a severance.

        The right of revocation of a license is subject to the qualification that where licensee has exercised the privilege given him and erected improvements or made substantial expenditures on the faith or strength of license, it becomes irrevocable and continues for so long a time as nature of license calls for since under this condition the license becomes in reality a grant through estoppel.

        In an action to recover damages to residence caused by city in maintaining inadequate ditches, the burden was on the city to allege and prove that the ditches were permanent and could not be repaired or remedied so as to avoid recurring injuries at a reasonable expense and, when it failed to do this and had reconstructed the ditches after suit had been brought, the court properly refused to give the city’s offered instructions covering its prescriptive right to the ditches for more than 15 years.

        The easement right acquired, when completed under the law, is based upon a presumption that the continued enjoyment of the easement, in such manner for the statutory period under the claim of right, was agreed to by the owner of the servient estate, and that it will be presumed that the right had its beginning in the grant.

        Where testimony indicated that when a railroad fill was constructed some 20 years previously ditch was filled up and there had been no artificial drainage since that time, any action for the original filling up of the artificial drainage ditch had long since been barred by the statute of limitations where there was nothing in the evidence which would indicate the existence of any prescriptive right to artificial drainage by plaintiff.

        Where owner of two (2) lots laid a pipe in about 1900 to take care of the natural drainage of the higher lot over the lower lot and defendant’s parents and predecessors in title bought the upper lot in 1904, the statute of limitations started running against the original owner of the lower lot at date of purchase of the upper lot and ripened into a prescriptive right in 1919 which was 18 years before plaintiffs purchased the lower lot, so the pipe had been in use for more than 15 years and defendant acquired a prescriptive right to run water through it in the manner and quantity she was doing when action was brought. Riggs v. Ketner, 299<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 754</cite>, 187 S.W.2d 287, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 770</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1945).

       <p>
        In many particulars, the elements necessary to be proved in order to establish the right to a prescriptive easement are similar to those that must be shown by one who attempts to acquire title to property by adverse possession, but it should be borne in mind during the consideration of such cases that estates sought to be fixed in the two (2) instances are different. Lyle v. Holman, 238 S.W.2d 157, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 808</cite> (Ky. 1951).

        If a company has used a stream for the drainage of water from its mines for the statutory period of 15 years, it has acquired the right to continue to use the stream for the same purpose, to the same extent, and under the same circumstances and conditions but the right is not unqualified and if the nuisance is progressive in character, or has been enlarged during the prescriptive period relied upon to establish the easement, the defense of prescriptive easement is not available.

        The use of property by express or implied permission or license, no matter how long continued, cannot ripen into easement by prescription, for there is no presumption of a grant and such a license or permissive right is revocable at pleasure of owner of servient estate, but this rule of law is subject to qualification that there has been no subsequent distinct and positive assertion of adverse claim of right to easement which is clearly brought to the notice of the owner of the servient estate.

        Any and all right of the unobstructed use of a passway is such a right as to be obtained by prescription and is to be determined by proof of such existing conditions running uninterruptedly throughout the statutory period under this section. Mann v. Phelps, 269<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 493</cite>, 107 S.W.2d 288, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 614</cite> (Ky. 1937).

       <p>
        In the absence of a grant in writing, or an oral agreement reserving or not reserving rights, the presumption prevails that the grant is such as has been shown by the use of the passway for the statutory period.

        A private passway may be acquired by prescriptive use, although a right of way is not strictly a subject of continuous, exclusive and adverse possession. Pickel v.

        Easements in the nature of passways may be acquired either by grant, where there is a regularly executed agreement by which the right to the easement is created, or by prescription based on the presumption of a grant arising from continuous use for 15 years. Clark v. Cunning, 302<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 779</cite>, 196 S.W.2d 609, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 765</cite> (Ky. 1946).

       <p>
        Where owners of dominant estate had used passageway over servient estate as means of ingress and egress for more than 29 years, a presumption of grant was created in favor of owners of the dominant estate, and the burden rested upon owners of servient estate to prove that the use of the passageway was all the while permissive or in the nature of a gracious indulgence on the part of the servient land toward the people of the dominant land. Clark v. Cunning, 302<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 779</cite>, 196 S.W.2d 609, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 765</cite> (Ky. 1946).

        An unexplained use of a passway over land of another for the statutory period creates presumption of grant, but such presumption creates only a prima facie case, which is rebuttable by facts and circumstances.

       <p>
        The quality of an easement presupposes two (2) distinct tenements, the dominant to which the right belongs and the servient upon which the easement is imposed, but the dominant is carved out of the servient estate only to the extent of and according to the nature of the use during the prescriptive period. Lyle v. Holman, 238 S.W.2d 157, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 808</cite> (Ky. 1951).

        When an easement is acquired by prescription, it may be conditional and restricted according to the use and purpose of its enjoyment during the prescriptive period and it will not ripen into a greater estate after the period of limitation has passed.

        While an “easement” is property of the nature of land, it is an incorporeal right, always separate and distinct from the right to occupy and enjoy the land itself. Lyle v. Holman, 238 S.W.2d 157, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 808</cite> (Ky. 1951).

        If the use of a passway by one landowner over the land of another originates in permission, the character of such use cannot become adverse until something is said or done by the dominant landowner to bring notice to servient owner that the use is changing or has changed from one of grace to one of legal right. Clark v. Cunning, 302<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 779</cite>, 196 S.W.2d 609, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 765</cite> (Ky. 1946).

       <p>
        In order to establish passway by prescription, the use exercised by the owner of the dominant estate must be shown to have been unobstructed, open, hostile, continuous and of right for the statutory period. Mathews v. Arvin, 306<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 840</cite>, 209 S.W.2d 494, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 664</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Slight evidence is sufficient to show that use of passway over a long period of years was enjoyed as a matter of right, but it must appear that the use exercised by the owner of the dominant estate was unobstructed, open, hostile, continuous, and as of right for the prescribed statutory period. Mathews v. Arvin, 306<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 840</cite>, 209 S.W.2d 494, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 664</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        The uninterrupted, continuous, and unexplained use of a passway by a claimant thereto for a period of as much or more than 15 years will raise a presumption that the use was under a claim of right which became absolute at expiration of 15 years, when claimant would become vested with title to the passway, which owner of the servient estate must acknowledge and respect. Lambert v. Huntsman, 306<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 862</cite>, 209 S.W.2d 709, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 669</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where use of a passway at its inception is shown to have been permissive, no length of time may ripen it into a right, unless in the meantime there has been a distinct and positive assertion of a claim of right to the easement, and which assertion is brought home to the owner of the servient estate. Lambert v. Huntsman, 306<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 862</cite>, 209 S.W.2d 709, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 669</cite> (Ky. 1948).

        The fact that owner for consideration permitted hauling of logs across his land was merely a specific instance falling within the period after he purchased the land and that one instance could not be persuasive or controlling as to whether there was a prescriptive right of passway since the hauling of logs is a heavy undertaking. Haynes v. Dennis, 308<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 483</cite>, 214 S.W.2d 1005, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 965</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general law is that there is a presumption of a grant of right of way by prescription following an uninterrupted, unexplained, adverse use of such right of way, and the burden is upon the landowner to show that the use was merely permissive, and further, such uninterrupted, unexplained use of a passway on another’s land creates the presumption that the use is adverse. Haynes v. Dennis, 308<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 483</cite>, 214 S.W.2d 1005, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 965</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        The presumption of a grant does not arise from use of passway where beginning of use is permissive but, where there was no evidence that beginning of use of passway was permissive, the rule did not apply. Haynes v. Dennis, 308<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 483</cite>, 214 S.W.2d 1005, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 965</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a passway has been used continuously and uninterruptedly for 15 years or more, the burden is upon the party denying the right to prove that it was used only by consent or permission. Lee v. Martin, 311<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 571</cite>, 224 S.W.2d 637, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1166</cite> (Ky. 1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        A private passway may be acquired by prescriptive use although a right of way is not strictly a subject of continuous, exclusive and adverse possession and it is sufficient if the use exercised by the owner of the dominant estate is unobstructed, open, peaceable, continuous and as of right for the prescribed statutory period. Lyle v. Holman, 238 S.W.2d 157, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 808</cite> (Ky. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        The establishment of a prescriptive use in a private way must be under a claim of right or adverse but where the claimant has shown long continued use, it will be presumed the use was under a claim of right, and the burden is upon the owner of the servient estate to show that the use was merely permissive. Lyle v. Holman, 238 S.W.2d 157, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 808</cite> (Ky. 1951).

        A way of necessity may be established as in the case of other easements, where a passway has been used for a period of 15 years, as well as by express or implied contracts and under

        In order to establish that passway had ripened into a private or public way, owner of adjoining lot must show it was used adversely by him and his predecessors in title or by the public generally in an open, continuous and uninterrupted manner for 15 years.

        One of the essentials of the establishment of a road by prescription is the use of the land in question by the public and such use must be by the public generally as a way common to all; the mere use by a few individuals, from time to time, as distinguished from the public generally, does not constitute such use as creates title in the public by prescription.

        There was no convincing evidence that passway had been used by the public generally nor so adversely by subsequent owners as to create a right of user by prescription. Westerfield v. Kessinger, 314<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc429" target="_blank">Ky. 429</a></cite>, 235 S.W.2d 1015, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 670</cite> (Ky. 1951).

        A prescriptive easement was not created across adjoining farm by the continuous use of a passageway by the dominant landowner of 30 years where the use was shown to be permissive for more than 27 years and only openly adverse for three (3) years. Clark v. Cunning, 302<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 779</cite>, 196 S.W.2d 609, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 765</cite> (Ky. 1946).

       <p>
        Where defendant opened up passway on his realty for use in his own business and others used it sporadically without objection from him but there was a total absence of proof that there was any assertion of a claim of right to the easement by anyone using it, circumstances attending the use of the passway clearly demonstrated that its enjoyment by others was but a mere favor and that it was never claimed as a right but on the contrary was treated as a privilege that could be withdrawn at pleasure and plaintiff did not have an easement over the passway. Lambert v. Huntsman, 306<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 862</cite>, 209 S.W.2d 709, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 669</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where person claiming private passway by prescription, and his predecessors in title, had not used passway for as long as 15 years and, although various other persons had used the passway over a longer period than 15 years, their use had been sporadic and without claim of right, prescriptive right to passway was not established. Lambert v. Huntsman, 306<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 862</cite>, 209 S.W.2d 709, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 669</cite> (Ky. 1948).

       <p>
        The easement established was not one for the public generally where the proof established only that it was a private way for the use of plaintiff and those to whom he sold and delivered tobacco during a determinable period of each year. It was for use in connection with plaintiff’s business and, resulting from its functional necessity, became a part of it. Lyle v. Holman, 238 S.W.2d 157, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Proof in action to establish a passway, both public and private, over an adjoining tract of land was that the passway, during its entire existence, had been enjoyed only in a permissive capacity by the various owners of the funeral home, including plaintiff. Rominger v. City Realty Co., 324 S.W.2d 806, 1959<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 380</cite> (Ky. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The acceptance by plaintiff, who was owner of adjoining lot seeking to establish a passway over vacant lot, of a lease contract from the owner of the vacant lot could not be satisfactorily explained otherwise than that it was an overt act by which plaintiff acknowledged owner had absolute title to the passway over his lot, which fact alone militated against any claim that there was a passway of a private nature. Rominger v. City Realty Co., 324 S.W.2d 806, 1959<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 380</cite> (Ky. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff’s evidence disclosed some trucks, automobiles and pedestrians traveled across the entire length of the passway going to and from streets but that the travel was of a casual or sporadic character, it was insufficient to establish either a private or a public thoroughfare. Rominger v. City Realty Co., 324 S.W.2d 806, 1959<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 380</cite> (Ky. 1959).

        Defendants to an action in trespass, by their own evidence, failed to establish that the road had been continually used by the public for 15 years. Stamper v. Caudill, 336 S.W.2d 362, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 328</cite> (Ky. 1960).

        Plaintiff and the general public were not entitled to a prescriptive easement over land owners’

        Evidence showed plaintiffs were entitled to a passway leading from their home to a public road by prescription, that is, a right to the passway founded on the prescription of a grant, such presumption arising from the adverse, uninterrupted, and continuous use of the passway by them for the statutory period of limitation, namely, 15 years. Kimble v. Warren, 158<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc384" target="_blank">Ky. 384</a></cite>, 165 S.W. 403, 1914<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 625</cite> (Ky. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any objection to the use of, or permission to use the passway, relating to a period subsequent to that within which the statutory time had already run, could not affect the right of easement, since the right had been fully established before that time. Wilkins v. Nieberger, 303<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 622</cite>, 303<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 662</cite>, 198 S.W.2d 986, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 538</cite> (Ky. 1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where testimony in suit to enjoin defendants from using a passway showed that passway had been there for a period of 75 years or more and there had been a continued and uninterrupted use throughout that period of time or until plaintiffs and their immediate grantors acquired title, the right had been fully established and could not be lost by attempted interruption. Wilkins v. Nieberger, 303<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 622</cite>, 303<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 662</cite>, 198 S.W.2d 986, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 538</cite> (Ky. 1947).

       <p>
        In action to require a defendant to remove gate barring passway over his land, evidence that passway had been used by the public for 75 years without question sustained decree granting plaintiff a prescriptive easement and right to use passway. Smith v. Smith, 304<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 562</cite>, 201 S.W.2d 720, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 678</cite> (Ky. 1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        As passway over defendant’s land was shown to have existed for a long number of years, there was a presumption that the use by the public was a matter of right and the burden was upon the owner of the servient estate to show that the use was permissive which he failed to do. Lovins v. Denney, 311<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc48" target="_blank">Ky. 48</a></cite>, 223 S.W.2d 352, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1048</cite> (Ky. 1949).

       <p>
        Evidence justified chancellor’s finding that passway had been used by the public as a matter of right for more than 15 years; therefore, the use had ripened into a grant. Lovins v. Denney, 311<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc48" target="_blank">Ky. 48</a></cite>, 223 S.W.2d 352, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1048</cite> (Ky. 1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action to enjoin defendants from obstructing a road leading to the plaintiff’s farm through the defendants’ farm, evidence preponderated in favor of plaintiff: that use of the road was not permissive and that he had acquired a prescriptive right to use the road or passway by adverse use of the road for a period of 15 years or more. Lee v. Martin, 311<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 571</cite>, 224 S.W.2d 637, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1166</cite> (Ky. 1949).

       <p>
        Although passway was blocked for limited periods by persons who temporarily utilized the space, the right of tobacco trucks to use the right of way during the market period was never questioned; therefore, the particular use of the easement was not interrupted for a period of over 20 years. Lyle v. Holman, 238 S.W.2d 157, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 808</cite> (Ky. 1951).

        Where proof showed public had used creek bed road for many years, a right by prescription to an unobstructed passway was established, so owner of farm through which road ran had no right to erect bars across roadbed in absence of showing he had acquired a prescriptive right to do so by keeping them up for more than 15 years. McGlone v. Maynard, 303<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc415" target="_self">Ky. 415</a></cite>, 197 S.W.2d 918, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 865</cite> (Ky. 1946).

        In an action to require removal of an obstruction and to enjoin interference with uninterrupted use of a passway where evidence decidedly showed that the use was not permissive in the beginning and that the road in question had been used by the public generally without interruption from 1897 until 1946 when defendants obstructed the road by placing gates at the ends of the passway, such acts of defendants did not serve notice to all users of the passway that thereafter any use of it must be by defendant’s permission, did not revoke any permissive use theretofore granted or constitute adverse possession by the defendants which would remove any prescriptive right which had theretofore been acquired over the land. Haynes v. Dennis, 308<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 483</cite>, 214 S.W.2d 1005, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 965</cite> (Ky. 1948).

        Where a passway, on entering and leaving defendant’s land, was obstructed by gates, a presumption was raised that any use of the passway by the public was permissive; however, this presumption could be overcome by showing that such use was actually adverse.

        An easement acquired by prescription may be extinguished by a nonuser under circumstances indicating an intention of abandonment whenever such nonuser has extended over that period of time sufficient to have created the prescriptive right at its origin. Jones v. Dunn, 305<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 562</cite>, 205 S.W.2d 156, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 875</cite> (Ky. 1947).

        Evidence, though conflicting, was sufficient to show plaintiff’s prescriptive easement over defendant’s land had been lost by complete disuse of the easement for 15 years or more. Jones v.

        The essential elements of such an adverse possession as would extinguish an easement are similar to those necessary for its original emergence as a legal right under prescriptive process at its creation.

        The presumption that a use is under a claim of right which became absolute at the expiration of 15 years, when the claimant would become vested with the title to the passway, which the owner of the servient estate must acknowledge and respect is not a conclusive one, but is only a rebuttable one, under and by virtue of which the owner of the servient estate may show in a controversy involving the right to the easement that use was in fact permissive only, in which case use would be but the exercise of a license which owner of the servient estate might revoke at pleasure.

        Evidence that easement for roadway over adjoining land had been allowed to fall into disrepair for some four (4) or five (5) years and had become overgrown and difficult for vehicular traffic, but that it could be made reasonably passable without much expense, was not sufficient to prove abandonment of easement. Chitwood v. Whitlow, 313<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.15.html#tXVc182" target="_blank">Ky. 182</a></cite>, 230 S.W.2d 641, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Forfeitures of easements, like other forfeitures, are not favored, and a temporary suspension of use without adverse possession is not along sufficient to show abandonment. Chitwood v.

        Generally, mere nonuser of easement for a relatively short period of time will not constitute an abandonment; there must be other acts or circumstances which indicate that owner of dominant estate intended to give up the rights in the land he had acquired.

        In an action to quiet title to a passway and to enjoin defendant from obstructing it, where there was ample proof that for 30 or 40 years the plaintiffs and members of the public used a roadway passing through defendant’s property to a road which joined the main highway at two (2) points, plaintiffs acquired a prescriptive right to use of the road and temporary disuse and disrepair of the passway did not constitute abandonment.

        After there has been 15 years of adverse possession, the bar falls and the adverse possessor is often said to have a perfect title; the true titleholder cannot molest him; he can then allow the property to be vacant and do just as he pleases; and his title will not be affected unless someone moves onto the property and initiates an adverse possession against him. Culton v. Simpson, 265<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc343" target="_blank">Ky. 343</a></cite>, 96 S.W.2d 856, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        To make an adverse possession definite, the adverse possessor must have either some color of title that will show the extent of his claim or a definite boundary often referred to as a well-marked line.

        A suit to quiet title to land may be maintained upon a title acquired by 15 years’ adverse possession, and the defendant may by answer and counterclaim, setting up title acquired by such required adverse holding of the land of the owner, also maintain a defense to the quia timet action brought against him.

        If one enters land under a paper title, the paper may be looked to as showing extent of his claim and possession, or, if he enters without a paper, but claiming to a marked boundary, that fact may be shown as indicating extent of his possession.

        Generally, a conveyance of land adversely held is champertous only when someone other than the grantor is in possession and is claiming adversely to grantor; consequently, to avoid a deed, adverse possession must exist at the time of the deed, without regard to the length of time the adverse possession has existed prior thereto, and this adverse possession must be of the same nature and character, excepting the period required by the statute of limitations, as the adverse possession which results in title by prescription. Deaton v. Morris, 308<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 754</cite>, 215 S.W.2d 854, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1038</cite> (Ky. 1948).

        In the adverse possession cases, the disseisor attempts to assert absolute and unqualified ownership of the entire property and he must be relentless in his insistence that the land belongs to him and no one else has any right in connection with it.

        There are five (5) elements of adverse possession: (1) possession must be hostile and under claim of right; (2) it must be actual; (3) it must be open and notorious; (4) it must be exclusive; and (5) it must be continuous.

        Where adverse possessor erected a billboard sign on the property approximately 35 years before the record title holder initiated action and in 1967 adverse possessor purchased the property from a third party so that it could continue to maintain its sign on the property, the physical nature of the property and the past use of the property both indicated that there could be no more practical use for this land and in addition, adverse possessor’s use of the land was an “open and notorious” one; further, the record title holder had actual notice of adverse possessor’s possession and this was evidenced by the fact that record title holder sought permission from adverse possessor to place its sign on the property.

        Widow’s only claim of title was a life estate created when she survived her husband, the owner, and the only contrary documents were created by her; the widow’s activities on the property were consistent with the duties of a life tenant, and a title action filed by the remaindermen within 15 years of her death was timely.

        Statute of limitations did not run during pendency of action against claimant by adverse possession but the rule did not apply so as to stop the running of the statute of limitations against a subsequent action leading to no change in possession.

        When limitation begins to run against the right to enforce a cause of action to recover land held by adverse possession, the running of the statute is not interrupted by reason of any subsequent event or condition, and the death of the ancestor will not stop the running of the statute.

        If one fences and takes possession of a neighbor’s land, the only way the neighbor can stop the running of the statute of limitations is by retaking possession or instituting suit within the statutory period; mere words will not be sufficient to stop the running of the statute.

        The filing of a suit involving the title to or possession of land will toll the running of the statute of limitations insofar as adverse possession is concerned for the purposes of that suit.

        In order to establish a title by adverse possession, it must clearly appear that the claimant has occupied the land openly, adversely, and notoriously for a period of 15 years or more, continuously claiming same to a well-defined or marked boundary line. Watts v. Bryant, 144<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc14" target="_blank">Ky. 14</a></cite>, 137 S.W. 780, 1911<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 540</cite> (Ky. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the question of adverse possession, the evidence of many witnesses thoroughly established the fact that defendant owned, claimed, and was in possession of a large area for more than 15 years which was inclosed by a well-defined and clearly marked boundary and that this boundary embraced all the land in controversy. Mounts v. Mounts, 155<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc363" target="_blank">Ky. 363</a></cite>, 159 S.W. 818, 1913<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 252</cite> (Ky. 1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not only necessary for defendant claiming adverse possession in an action of ejectment to claim the land in controversy to a well-defined or well-marked boundary, but his possession at the time of the deed to plaintiff must have been an actual adverse possession, manifested by some act or fact sufficient to indicate to others that he in fact had the possession and that the ousted claimant had been dispossessed. Le Moyne v. Neal, 158<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc316" target="_blank">Ky. 316</a></cite>, 164 S.W. 964, 1914<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 612</cite> (Ky. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant claimed under his deed but also claimed that his deed included the land in dispute and that his fence was on the true line, the claiming of all the land up to his fence precluded any possibility of admission upon his part of ownership in another and his holding was adverse from the time he inclosed the land 30 years previously. Turner v. Morgan, 158<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc511" target="_blank">Ky. 511</a></cite>, 165 S.W. 684, 1914<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 658</cite> (Ky. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not necessary to determine, in an action to enjoin trespass, whether a fence was on the dividing line as originally surveyed where the fence had been at its present location for more than 15 years and plaintiff had been in possession of the land up to the fence and claiming it for the statutory period and had acquired the land up to the fence by adverse possession. Petty v. Petty, 265<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc15" target="_blank">Ky. 15</a></cite>, 95 S.W.2d 1122, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 446</cite> (Ky. 1936).

       <p>
        One who without color of title enters on land having well-defined boundaries marked on it, or which he himself marks thereon, and who occupies and uses a part, claiming the whole, acquires possession, coextensive with the boundaries, unless some part is in the actual possession of another, or there is conflict as to the boundary with another which is older or superior and the owner of the latter has entered on the boundary. Culton v. Simpson, 265<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc343" target="_blank">Ky. 343</a></cite>, 96 S.W.2d 856, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 479</cite> (Ky. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        To acquire property by adverse possession, the would-be adverse possessor does not have to clear it or even fence it, but he must have a definite boundary to which he intends to claim, and he must have that when he enters and he cannot move his boundary out year by year and claim, at the end of the statutory period, all the land then within the boundary. Culton v. Simpson, 265<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc343" target="_blank">Ky. 343</a></cite>, 96 S.W.2d 856, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        While a would-be adverse possessor without color of title may claim to a boundary marked by another as well as to one marked by himself, he would have this advantage in the latter case — his own act in marking the line would indicate his intention—and in the former instance he would have to show intent to claim to the line marked by another but in either case there must be a definite line to which he must claim. Culton v. Simpson, 265<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc343" target="_blank">Ky. 343</a></cite>, 96 S.W.2d 856, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        If, in an action in ejectment, plaintiff and his immediate and remote grantors, by themselves and tenants, were in the continuous possession of the strip of land in controversy, adversely, to a well-defined boundary for as long as 15 years next before the action was instituted, then his case is made out. Greenway v. Watson, 268<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 745</cite>, 105 S.W.2d 848, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 523</cite> (Ky. 1937).

        Where the dividing line is uncertain and there is a bona fide dispute as to its location between adjoining landowners who agree on the dividing line and execute the agreement by marking the line or building a fence thereon, such agreement, followed by possession with reference to the boundary so fixed, is conclusive on the parties although the possession may not have been for the full statutory period, it being sufficient to show that the dividing line was actually established and thereafter recognized or acquiesced in by the parties for a considerable time. Hill v. Kerr, 277<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc105" target="_blank">Ky. 105</a></cite>, 125 S.W.2d 1005, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 618</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The owner of a tract, merely by extending its boundaries, does not take such adverse possession of the adjoining land embraced within the extension, overlapping the boundary of the adjoining owner, as would ripen into title; yet, where the dividing line is uncertain and in bona fide dispute as to its location, and a conditional line is established between the adjoining landowners, who agree as to its location and execute the agreement by marking the line, as by setting up stones and stakes at its corners or building a fence, such agreement is not an ineffectual settlement of their boundary controversy, nor is it prohibited by the statute of frauds. Cassada v. Vanhook, 282<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc383" target="_blank">Ky. 383</a></cite>, 138 S.W.2d 1003, 1940<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Where defendant, in addition to his paper title, further alleged in his counterclaim and proved that more than 50 years previously, his and plaintiff’s ancestors in title agreed upon and established a conditional line between the lands now in dispute and that he and his predecessors in title since that date had claimed the land in dispute and had it in possession for more than 50 years and pleaded the statute of limitations, the court correctly found for defendant. Martin v. Oliver, 295<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 624</cite>, 175 S.W.2d 127, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 314</cite> (Ky. 1943).

        Where strip of land between plaintiff’s and defendant’s lots had been fenced in with defendant’s lot and openly occupied and used by defendant and his predecessors in title for more than 15 years, defendant had title by adverse possession, particularly where no one occupying plaintiff’s lot had made any claim to the strip until plaintiff purchased the lot shortly before filing suit. Garthwaite v. Harges, 301<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 653</cite>, 192 S.W.2d 734, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 755</cite> (Ky. 1945).

        Evidence was sufficient to justify the chancellor, in an action charging wrongful entry on land and cutting trees therefrom, in concluding an old fence row to have been established by agreement more than 30 years prior to plaintiff’s purchase of the land and that the land up to that fence row had been held openly, notoriously and adversely for more than the prescriptive period by the defendants. Goodwin v. McNeill, 314<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.51.html#tXXXXXIc605" target="_blank">Ky. 605</a></cite>, 236 S.W.2d 708, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Where parties for 15 years or more had recognized a row of trees as the true, common boundary of their property, and defendant in quiet title action had cultivated the land right up to the row of trees for more than 15 years and had otherwise manifested adverse possession, the line described by the row of trees was accepted as the proven line since the location of the paper line was in irreconcilable conflict. Combs v. Combs, 240 S.W.2d 558, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 972</cite> (Ky. 1951).

        Where parties for 15 years or more have recognized a certain line as the true, common boundary of their property, the courts will recognize that as the true location and the record line becomes unimportant.

        Petition which described 169-acre tract by metes and bounds, and stated that plaintiffs were the owners in possession of the property and had claimed it to a well-marked boundary for more than 15 years, was sufficiently definite. Mullins v. Hargis, 242 S.W.2d 611, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1051</cite> (Ky. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a quiet title action, where a fence stood as a mark and as notice to owners for over 50 years that this was the true division line of the property and the possession of defendant and all his predecessors to the fence was adverse and notorious and plaintiff made no effort to have the fence removed nor indicate by any action it was claiming beyond the fence, the court should have decided that the property up to the fence belonged to defendant. Newman v. Sharp, 248 S.W.2d 413, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 738</cite> (Ky. 1952).

        Where one is in actual possession of a tract to which he has good title, he may not by construction extend boundaries of his possession to cover land owned by another. Fletcher v. Bringardner Lumber Co., 249 S.W.2d 38, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 789</cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        The record contained sufficient proof to show that defendant, ever since the time he erected a fence upon assuming possession under a contract of sale and after he acquired title under a deed which was recorded, held the land in controversy adversely to the world and that these facts were known by plaintiff and his predecessors in title and, while it was true that the fence did not extend completely across the division line between the two (2) properties, it did extend over half the distance and it was sufficient to establish the direction of the boundary. Cox v. Spainhower, 249 S.W.2d 719, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 841</cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the parties to an agreement fixing the boundary line each take possession to the agreed line and exercise possession for the statutory period, the agreed line becomes fixed, although the agreement may be in violation of the statute of frauds, upon the theory that adverse possession precludes either party from claiming beyond the agreed line. Faulkner v. Lloyd, 253 S.W.2d 972, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1126</cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to establish the actual possession necessary for adverse possession, a party is required to show more than an inclosed fence, constructed by another person, for another purpose. Caudill v. Bates, 286 S.W.2d 922, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 113</cite> (Ky. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the owner attempts to extend his boundary to a boundary marked by another, he must clearly show an intent to claim to the line marked. Caudill v. Bates, 286 S.W.2d 922, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 113</cite> (Ky. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence of adverse possession to a well-marked boundary line during the lifetime of one defendant and his father amply supported chancellor’s finding for defendant and that plaintiff in a quiet title action was not entitled to quiet his title against defendant.

        Adverse possession consists of outward acts and inward intention and the intention guides the entry and fixes its character and extent. Culton v. Simpson, 265<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc343" target="_blank">Ky. 343</a></cite>, 96 S.W.2d 856, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 479</cite> (Ky. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        The important element of adverse possession in this state is the intent to adversely hold another’s property for the statutory period of 15 years. Marcum v. Noble, 242 S.W.2d 866, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1082</cite> (Ky. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is a disputed boundary line, possession is adverse if property is held with intention of claiming to such boundary line, though it may be incorrect, but if the possession is with the intention of claiming only if boundary is correct, it is not adverse. Marcum v. Noble, 242 S.W.2d 866, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1082</cite> (Ky. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Hostile or adverse possession of land must be accompanied with an intention to possess and hold it to the exclusion of all others and this intention can be gathered from acts and declarations of claimant while in possession and from circumstances attending his entry and occupation. Jones v. Caddell, 244 S.W.2d 744, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1239</cite> (Ky. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        The claimant’s intention is the controlling factor under the rules that even though a party may make a mistake as to true location of boundary line, if he has intention to hold another’s property adversely, such intention will determine the nature of his possession. Traylor v. West, 255 S.W.2d 612, 1953<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 667</cite> (Ky. 1953).

       <p>
        Where one occupies another’s land by mistake but does not intend to claim land not belonging to him, his possession will not be adverse. Traylor v. West, 255 S.W.2d 612, 1953<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 667</cite> (Ky. 1953).
       </p>

        A possession which, if continued for the statutory period of 15 years, will ripen into title must, in the first instance, be an actual possession and, if the adverse possessor enters under a deed or other written instrument evidencing title with the intention to possess the land to the extent of boundaries described in his deed or writing, he ordinarily will be considered to be in actual possession to the extent of his boundary lines.

        It was unnecessary to consider whether, in the absence of an alleged deed to plaintiff’s ancestor, the evidence was sufficient to show possession by plaintiff’s ancestor coextensive with the boundary described in the complaint where plaintiff, in action for damages for cutting and removal of timber, failed to show they were in actual possession at the time of the cutting and removal of the timber or that their ancestor had held possessory title for 15 years, thereby establishing title in him by adverse possession.

        Actual prior possession of property is enough to establish a legal possessory right and is sufficient to maintain an action for trespass against an adverse claimant who has no title and who stands alone on his later possession; therefore, railroad in actual possession of land under a deed before defendants began fencing and building houses on the land, notwithstanding positive and persistent notice by the railroad company that they were trespassing, was entitled to judgment in their action to recover possession of the land and to require defendants to remove the fences and buildings.

        A well-recognized exception to the Kentucky rule requiring continuous and uninterrupted possession for the full statutory period, in order to ripen an adverse claim into legal title, is that a temporary interruption, not of unreasonable duration, does not destroy the continuity of the adverse possession. Gillis v. Curd, 117 F.2d 705, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 4308 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1941</cite>).

        In condemnation proceeding wherein intervenor claimed title to tract of land by adverse possession, his claim could not stand up where evidence was insufficient to establish continuous adverse possession for full statutory period. United States v. 179.9 Acres, 107 F. Supp. 265, 1952 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3782 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1952</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for adverse possession to ripen into title, one of the essential elements is that the possession relied upon shall have been continuous for the full statutory period and, if the continuity of possession be broken by voluntary abandonment or otherwise before the end of the statutory period, such break is fatal to acquisition of title by the adverse claimant and the law restores constructive possession to the owner of the legal title. United States v. 179.9 Acres, 107 F. Supp. 265, 1952 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3782 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1952</cite>).

        Where acts of adverse possession relied on were cutting crossties for six (6) months in 1922, cutting enough timber for a house in 1933 and cutting timber for another house in 1945, the entirely unexplained prolonged periods of abandonment constituted such breaks in the continuity of petitioner’s possession as to preclude his acquisition by adverse possession as against the holder of legal title. United States v. 179.9 Acres, 107 F. Supp. 265, 1952 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3782 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1952</cite>).

        It is the rule in this state that the feeding of hogs or the grazing of cattle on uninclosed land will not constitute adverse possession, as such acts are in the same category with other fitful acts of possession, such as the occasional cutting of timber, of the mowing of hay, or the digging of coal, or the establishment of a sugar camp for a short period of time, which are generally regarded as insufficient to sustain a plea of limitation. Kentucky Coal Lands Co. v. Wilder, 165<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc293" target="_blank">Ky. 293</a></cite>, 176 S.W. 1155, 1915<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Where defendant entered land in 1903 and remained continually in possession until 1934, but judgment quieting title was entered against him in favor of another in 1916, defendant could not claim title by adverse possession, although no writ of possession was issued on 1916 judgment, since he was estopped by judgment from claiming title so long as judgment remained in effect, and could not add period after judgment was barred by limitations to period before judgment was entered because adverse possession must be continuous, and was broken by judgment.

        Evidence showed that plaintiff, who was claiming under a void tax deed, did not hold land in adverse possession for 15 continuous years through tenant where tenant lived on the property a year after his mother’s death, then moved to another place where he lived for nine months before returning to the property, since the interim of nine months broke the continuity of the adverse possession and the disseizor had to start all over again to hold adversely for 15 continuous years before he could obtain title by adverse possession. Wilder v. Lee, 304<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc144" target="_blank">Ky. 144</a></cite>, 200 S.W.2d 153, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 603</cite> (Ky. 1947).

        The fact that the owner for a consideration permitted the hauling of logs across his lands was merely a specific instance which fell within the period since he had purchased the land, and was not persuasive or controlling due to the fact that the hauling of logs is a heavy undertaking.

        When a trespasser continuously shall have disseized the lawful owner by taking actual, open, exclusive, and notorious possession adverse to the claim of the lawful owner for a period of 15 years, title to the land ripens in the name of the disseizor, but if disseizor relinquishes his actual possession by “stepping off” the property, even for a moment, within the 15-year period, the continuity of the trespasser’s possession thereby is broken and he must “step back” to commence again and mere occasional entry by a junior patentee, either in person or by his tenant, does not satisfy the rule as to continuity of possession. Fletcher Lumber Co. v. Fordson Coal Co., 311<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc19" target="_blank">Ky. 19</a></cite>, 223 S.W.2d 175, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Where adverse possession relied on by defendant lumber company was through the tenants under its various contracts of lease which had been continuous from 1910 to 1939 but the evidence showed possession by the tenants had been sporadic, with the tenants tilling the land a year or so, abandoning it for a year or two, then returning, retilling and reabandoning and with a part of the fence “laid down” permitting cattle to enter at random during the years it was not in cultivation, such occasional possession did not ripen into title and the chancellor properly adjudged defendant to have been trespasser and liable to plaintiff for the value of timber cut from the tract, and he correctly enjoined defendant from continuing to trespass on the tract. Fletcher Lumber Co. v. Fordson Coal Co., 311<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc19" target="_blank">Ky. 19</a></cite>, 223 S.W.2d 175, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Adverse possession must be continuous to oust the true owner; otherwise, the latter’s constructive possession reasserts itself whenever the disseizor abandons his occupancy even for a short period of time. Thompson v. Ratcliff, 245 S.W.2d 592, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 595</cite> (Ky. 1952).

       <p>
        After one has gone into adverse possession, its continuity may be broken by: (1) an act of the real owner; (2) intrusion of a stranger; or (3) abandonment by the occupant. Thompson v. Ratcliff, 245 S.W.2d 592, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 595</cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of continuous possession is a sound one, but it does not mean that the disseizor in person need be present on the premises at all times; the important consideration is whether or not the physical use of the property by the adverse claimant or his representative, the erection of structures, or the keeping of chattels thereon demonstrates that he is asserting dominion over the property. Thompson v. Ratcliff, 245 S.W.2d 592, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 595</cite> (Ky. 1952).

        In order to acquire title by adverse possession, the possession of the claimant must not only be actual but so continuous as to furnish a cause of action in ejectment or for trespass every day during the statutory period of 15 years, and trimming and caring for the trees and shrubbery and cutting the grass on adjoining property was not sufficient to meet the test.

        Where the property in controversy was built upon and improved to some extent and it was used and improved as owners are accustomed to do, it would seem such conduct showed a hostile entry which amounted to a public pronouncement of hostility to the title of the real owner by grantees in possession up to the supposed lines with absolute claim of title thereto and they were deemed to have held adversely although their claim of title originated in a mistaken belief that the land lay within the calls of their deeds.

        Where son entered upon land by permission of his parents, occupied a house for 48 years which he helped his father to construct, built a fence to inclose six (6) acres of his father’s 138 acres, tilled the soil, planted an orchard and paid the taxes, expecting his parents would give the six (6) acres to him, his possession was not a hostile holding as he occupied the property by permission of his parents and his brothers and sisters to whom his parents subsequently deeded the property and not under a claim of title and he could not maintain claim of title based on adverse possession as there was no proof he ever apprised the true owners that he was no longer occupying the house under permissive use and intended to hold it adversely to them.

        Adverse claimants’ sporadic payment of property taxes on the disputed lot, their sporadic clearing of the property, and their lease of the property to a relative from 1979 to 1995 were insufficient to establish hostile possession for 15 years as was required in an adverse possession claim under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.010" target="_self">413.010</a></cite>, as neither the payment of taxes nor clearing of the property were continuous, and the tenant was related to the owner of the property.

        One cannot acquire title to the land of another by paying the taxes on it, nor will a claim of title under a void deed, although recorded, ripen into a fee by lapse of time, nor will limitations run against the owner of record in favor of a claimant not in possession, nor is it incumbent upon the owner to sue for cancellation of a void deed, or to take steps to remove a cloud upon his title, nor need he make investigation of the record in order to correct any mistake in the sheriff’s report of sale of his land for taxes.

        An adverse possession cannot be established by paying taxes upon the covered property; however, where one enters upon and begins to hold a definitely described piece of property and to pay taxes on the whole of it, such payment of taxes upon the whole is some evidence of an intention to seize and claim the whole.

        The only way the statutes can be started running in favor of the surface holder as against the owner of the mineral is by the former taking actual possession of the mineral under claim of right by opening mines or wells and operating the same and when this possession has continued for the statutory period, title to the mineral by adverse possession is perfected, but the opening of a coal bank or oil or gas wells for the purpose of taking only a small quantity of the mineral for domestic purposes and not with the avowed intention of acquiring title to the whole mineral estate does not start the statutes running.

        In an action to quiet title to coal and minerals lying under a 35-acre tract and to recover damages under claim of record title and adverse possession, evidence was convincing that at no time did the adverse claimant abandon the premises but on the other hand they were committing a trespass as against the true owners and the evidence supported the finding that plaintiff was the holder of title by adverse possession.

        The required factors to establish adverse possession of minerals are identical with those required for adverse possession of land. In other words, there must be exclusive, actual, peaceable, open and notorious, continuous and hostile possession of minerals under a claim of right for the statutory period. Diederich v.

        The actual occupancy by a junior patentee or junior titleholder of that part of a tract of land which does not interfere with the elder grant does not give him possession of the part within the interference by adverse possession, although the elder patentee or titleholder never actually entered upon any part of the land included in the patent.

        If an entrant goes upon a boundary under a junior patent, which latter is entirely or partly within a senior grant or survey, he will be deemed to be in actual possession of only so much of the land as he actually incloses, if owner of senior grant is then in actual possession of his boundary; or, if owner of senior grant be not in actual possession of boundary in his grant but enters thereon before patentee of junior grant has ripened a title by adverse possession, grantee of junior grant will be restricted to his actual close.

        A tenant cannot ordinarily set up an adverse possession, and will be prima facie deeded to continue in that character so long as he remains in the occupation of the land, but a tenant who has openly disavowed the title of the landlord, and notoriously held adversely to him by clear and positive claim on the part of the tenant, with the knowledge of the landlord, will be protected by the statute of limitations after the lapse of the statutory period.

        The possession of a cotenant may be adverse or hostile to other cotenants and, if continued for 15 years or more, will ripen into a perfect title whether the original entry was with intent to hold adversely or whether the entry was as tenant in common.

        Any use of lands which is not inconsistent with the cotenancy is not sufficient to make the outstanding cotenants aware of the adverse claim, and will not amount to a disseizin, or start the statute of limitations to running; but the erection of permanent and lasting structures, the sale and conveyance by recorded deeds of the whole or portions of the estate in fee are such acts as are reasonably calculated to apprise fairly prudent persons of the fact that the claimant is holding adversely to his cotenant.

        Every cotenant has the right to enter into and occupy common property and every part thereof, provided, in so doing, he does not exclude his fellow tenants or otherwise deny to them some right to which they are entitled as cotenants, and they, on their part, may safely assume, until something occurs to the contrary of which they must take notice, that possession is held by him as cotenant and is not adverse to any of them, and there can be no adverse holding against a cotenant who does not know that he has an interest in the land.

        One joint tenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against his cotenants by mere possession, no matter how long continued, for he has a right to occupy the premises, and his occupancy thereof is not to be presumed hostile, but is presumed to be amicable and in harmony with his legal rights.

        The possession of one joint owner is presumptively the possession of all; therefore, mere possession can never ripen into title by adverse possession as against cotenants. To acquire title by adverse possession, a joint owner must make his possession of such a character as to bring home to his cotenants notice that he is holding and claiming adversely to them. Moore v. Gaines, 308<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc223" target="_blank">Ky. 223</a></cite>, 213 S.W.2d 990, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 878</cite> (Ky. 1948).

        The statute of limitations will not begin to run in favor of the cotenant in possession until notice of adverse holding is brought home to his coowners and, while this may be accomplished by acts of such notoriety and conspicuousness as would be calculated to put ordinarily prudent persons upon notice of his adverse holding, the burden is upon the claimant to show a disseizin and notice. In absence of a contrary showing, presumption is that a joint tenant is holding common property for joint use and benefit of himself and cotenants. Moore v.

        Where cotenant, by inheritance, resided in a distant state and never knew that she had an interest in the land in question until she was asked to sign a quit-claim deed, the fact that her cotenant claimed and occupied land, paid balance on purchase-money note, made all necessary repairs, paid insurance and taxes, rented property and kept all proceeds, for the statutory period, was not sufficient to give cotenant title by adverse possession. Moore v. Gaines, 308<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc223" target="_blank">Ky. 223</a></cite>, 213 S.W.2d 990, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 878</cite> (Ky. 1948).

        Adverse possession of part of adjoining parcel by one tenant in common is not personal to that cotenant but must be deemed to be that of all of the cotenants and is effective to vest title by adverse possession in all of the cotenants and a deed by them passes title to the adversely possessed land to their grantee who can tack the adverse possession by the cotenants even though the deed from them to the purchaser does not expressly convey the adversely possessed land.

        In an action to quiet title to both the surface and the minerals of a tract of land where the defendant’s grantor had conveyed the surface of the land in dispute, but had retained the mineral rights, the grantor should have been made a party defendant from the outset rather than being added as a party by amendment after the proof was taken, and any evidence taken between the plaintiffs and the defendant was improperly considered against the defendant’s grantor, as he should have been given the opportunity to make his own defense.

        A party may prove title by adverse possession under a general allegation of ownership, although adverse possession has not been specifically pleaded. Bryant v. Bullock, 309<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 590</cite>, 218 S.W.2d 381, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 754</cite> (Ky. 1949).

        Where some of the evidence admitted in an action to settle a boundary dispute was incompetent and irrelevant but the court properly admonished the jury not to consider the challenged incompetent evidence, it could not be concluded that the court was improperly swayed either by the “conduct” of the witness or by the incompetent and irrelevant testimony most of which related to the matter of “boundary” and not to adverse possession.

        Evidence in action to quiet title established title in plaintiff by adverse possession for more than 15 years where plaintiff’s chain of title to the Commonwealth was complete, plaintiff through tenants and subtenants had fenced the land, erected houses, cleared and cultivated the fields and had possession of the land when defendant in a bad faith effort purchased and undertook to take possession of house occupied by one of the tenants.

        Where proof was clear that defendant’s predecessor acquired deed in 1903 from a man who had been in possession of it a great number of years and, immediately upon obtaining his deed, inclosed the entire tract with a fence and successive owners claimed title to the entire tract within the fence as constructed in 1903, there could be no doubt but that the testimony established the necessary adverse possession in defendants and those through whom they claimed to ripen title in them to that tract and the court did not err in quieting title in defendant.

        The fact that original owner of defendant’s lot had fenced in and occupied a strip of adjoining lot with permission of owner of adjoining lot would not bar defendant from claiming title to the strip by adverse possession, where defendant, in purchasing lot, thought that he was obtaining title back to fence, and he occupied and used the strip for more than 15 years.

        Where, through mistake, building was so constructed that part of one wall and all of an outside stairway extended onto adjoining lot, and, notwithstanding subsequent notice of encroachment from adjoining owner, the building and stairway continued to be used openly and without interference for more than 15 years, the owner of the building thus acquired title by adverse possession to the extent of the encroachment, as against contention of adjoining owner that a party wall had been established by agreement.

        In a condemnation proceeding, the claimants of the whole award wholly failed to establish title by adverse possession, since there were no inclosures on the land, they had no color of title, and they failed to establish by their evidence a well-marked boundary defining the limits of their possession or acts within the boundary sufficient to acquire title by adverse possession.

        Evidence that decedent sold merchantable timber on unfenced four-acre tract on two (2) occasions, and the timber was cut and sawed with about 15 years elapsing between the two (2) sales; that he cut timber on the land regularly during his lifetime for his personal use but never cultivated it; that he sold or gave a small strip of it to a neighbor who owned an adjoining tract and permitted the strip to be fenced; that on two (2) occasions he permitted the erection of a temporary house on the land; that for nearly 50 years he was the only person who exercised or attempted to exercise any dominion over the land; and that he was the owner was generally recognized throughout the community, sufficiently established title in him by adverse possession.

        Where plaintiff in action to quiet title pleaded that on an indefinite date she and her husband entered into an agreement for exchange of land with defendants, that defendants promised to convey to her and her husband the tract of land described in petition, and that she thereafter took possession of said land and adversely possessed it more than 15 years prior to commencement of action, and, by answer, defendants admitted that in 1934 they entered into an agreement for exchange of lands as alleged, but that the description of the land to be conveyed by them was different from that set out by the plaintiff, the pleadings formed a very clear issue concerning what the 1934 agreement was which question was controlling in the case and the finding of the chancellor that the agreement was as claimed by plaintiff was certainly supported by the pleadings.

        Evidence that defendants and their predecessors in title had occupied and had exercised dominion over the land in controversy for a period exceeding 50 years, cultivating crops and cutting timber, and that no claim was made by plaintiffs or their predecessors in title that it was their land, justified a finding that defendants had title by adverse possession.

        In an action in which plaintiffs relied on record title and adverse possession to an entire city lot and defendant relied on adverse possession and title under a deed made by grantors who did not own the property to the eastern portion of the lot, evidence disclosing that plaintiffs and their predecessors in title, through an unbroken record title, had been living in a residence on the western portion of the city lot for over a half century and that no one occupied the eastern portion of the lot for over 35 years before defendant built a taxi stand seven years prior to suit justified finding title to the entire lot in plaintiff.

        While the evidence introduced in behalf of defendants in quiet title action tended to contradict the proof offered by plaintiffs concerning the character of plaintiffs’ possession of the land, thus making a sharp issue of fact, the chancellor had ample evidence upon which to resolve that plaintiffs had title by adverse possession.

        In action to establish title and right to possession of small farm, it was proper to allow the jury to determine whether plaintiffs had established their title by adverse possession and, as the jury had been instructed that plaintiffs had burden of proving they had acquired title by adverse possession for reason defendants had first established a prima facie case as to their title, verdict was not flagrantly against the evidence.

        Where a lot was donated to a city for use as a public square and the city purported to deed the lot to the board of education for use as a school, the purported deed was an abandonment of the property by the city and the reversionary interest in the heirs of grantor vested in them at the time the school building was erected by the board of education giving the board of education title by adverse possession when they thereafter held the property in excess of 15 years.

        The possession of plaintiffs was adverse if they intended to and did hold to the fence which had stood for 40 years, regardless of the condition of the fence and of where the true boundary ran, or were in a strong but erroneous belief that the boundary fixed by the fence was the true boundary line and, while there was no evidence to show plaintiff had read his deed or had intended to claim to the fence only in the event it proved to be the true boundary, there was his testimony that he took possession of “everything inside the fence” and evidence that he openly treated the property as his own, and utilized it continuously for the purposes for which the land was best suited — pasturing and timber-cutting; accordingly, his possession ripened into title by adverse possession against the record owners after 15 years.

        Evidence established beyond a doubt, even if defendant’s deed did embrace the land in controversy, that plaintiff in quiet title action had acquired ownership by adverse possession and was entitled to damages for the wrongful taking over of her house and premises in the amount of the reasonable rental value for the time it was withheld, where, within a few months after she bought the property, she inclosed all the land she purchased and also the disputed tract with a fence which had remained around the land except for repairs until fairly recent years, had put in a garden each year in the disputed area, had built a garage on the tract, had later erected a house where the garage had been and had held the land for 28 years against all comers, thinking the land was hers and treating it as such, and no one had objected to her claim of ownership until the defendant attempted to convey the land.

        Where the possession of plaintiff was limited to that tract to which they had good title and the only showing of possession on the disputed tract was possession which started about two (2) years prior to the time of forfeiture of patent, plaintiffs had no better claim to the disputed tract under old forfeiture statute requiring five (5) years of adverse possession next preceding judgment of forfeiture of land to state for nonpayment of taxes as prerequisite to vesting of title by adverse possession than they had under this section.

        Open, visible and notorious possession limited to the cutting of trees from time to time over a period of some 40 years was not such adverse possession as to invest title in defendants or to make the plaintiffs’ deeds void under the champerty statute (KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.30.html#tXXXc372s372.060" target="_blank">372.060</a></cite>).

        Where plaintiff’s predecessor in title built, in about the year 1910, a rail fence between two (2) tracts and located it where he did because of necessity due to rough terrain rather than as an actual monument to the true line, which fence remained in place until the early 1930’s, when, after a part of it had been destroyed, the remainder was removed by plaintiff’s predecessor in title who had, during the time it remained in place, pastured, cultivated and occasionally cut timber from the inclosed area, plaintiff did not establish a claim of adverse possession to the place where the fence was located, for the holding by plaintiff’s predecessor was not hostile and adverse and the original fence was not built for the purpose of holding adversely. Thompson v. Gonterman, 285 S.W.2d 157, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 67</cite> (Ky. 1955).

        In an action to restrain defendant from cutting and removing timber from a tract of land inclosed with defendant’s land by a fence erected by the owners of the mineral rights under defendant’s land, evidence to the effect that defendant had cultivated one corner of the tract for a number of years and had on various occasions cut and sold timber but the number of trees was small and no regular pattern of activity appeared was insufficient to establish adverse possession where plaintiff had protested the construction of the fence and had cut it in various places during the years. Caudill v. Bates, 286 S.W.2d 922, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 113</cite> (Ky. 1955).

        Assuming defendant’s claim of adverse possession to the whole of an old country road could properly be asserted in an action to quiet title to a portion of the road and to enjoin its obstruction by defendant, the evidence was highly conflicting as to its nature and extent and court on appeal could not say that chancellor’s finding that the claim was not proven was clearly erroneous. Hylton v. Belcher, 290 S.W.2d 475, 1956<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 321</cite> (Ky. 1956).

       <p>
        Mere fact that a person executed one deed conveying fee simple to certain realty and another deed conveying the minerals underlying said realty of which he was not record owner was not a basis for presuming he had actual adverse possession of such realty.

       <p>
        Petitioners failed to establish adverse possession because petitioners’
    use of the disputed property for hunting, fishing, and other recreation and their one-time removal of timber were indistinguishable from the other uses which did not establish “actual” possession; the use in no way altered the condition of the property. It remained today the wild, unimproved land it had long been. Moore v. Stills, 307 S.W.3d 71, 2010<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 50</cite> (Ky. 2010).

        In action in ejectment, instruction to the jury omitting the word “next” from the clause “and shall further believe from the evidence that said plaintiff and her predecessors in title have been in the actual adverse
    . . . . .
    possession of same for 15 years or more prior to the 19th day of October, 1938, then you will find your verdict for the plaintiff” was not prejudicial where all proof was directed to 15 years’ continuous adverse possession immediately prior to October 19, 1938, and there was no evidence that there was any break in the possession of either party. Jones v. Sanders, 284<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 571</cite>, 145 S.W.2d 514, 1940<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 540</cite> (Ky. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury instructions that submitted the question of whether or not use of land by plaintiff was adverse or permissive were proper where plaintiff both by pleadings and proof asserted title to the land by adverse possession and where her claim was not merely a right of easement by more than 15 years’ adverse use as a route to the pond but a claim that she was the owner of the land in fee. Price v. Shadoan, 298<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 828</cite>, 184 S.W.2d 237, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1025</cite> (Ky. 1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instructions which told jury in substance that if defendants and their predecessors in title had for 15 years or more claimed adversely up to the line located by defendants’ own surveyor, they should find for defendants, if not, then the jury should find for plaintiff, and defined adverse possession, fairly submitted the issue on the question of adverse possession by the defendants. Jones v. Goss, 307<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.21.html#tXXIc263" target="_blank">Ky. 263</a></cite>, 210 S.W.2d 958, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 732</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not error to instruct jury on adverse possession in an action to quiet title where defendant alleged in his answer that he was the owner and in possession of the land in controversy, it was stipulated at the beginning of the trial that the questions involved dealt with the location of the line between the plaintiff and the defendant, and the question of adverse possession and champerty, and practically all the proof was to the effect that the defendant and his predecessors in title had been in the undisputed and uninterrupted possession of the land in controversy for more than 50 years. Bryant v. Bullock, 309<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 590</cite>, 218 S.W.2d 381, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 754</cite> (Ky. 1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action to settle boundary dispute, the instructions correctly spelled out the facts to be included to constitute adverse possession: that plaintiff held possession of the tract of land described under color of title to a well-marked boundary, openly, notoriously, hostilely, and adversely to defendant and for a period of 15 years, occupying and using the same under color of right. Marcum v. Noble, 242 S.W.2d 866, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1082</cite> (Ky. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction authorizing jury to find for adjoining landowners if they believed their possession had been actually adverse rather than permissive or with an intention to claim only to true boundary was proper and presented both plaintiff’s and defendant’s theory of the case in an action by adjoining landowners to quiet title to tract they had allegedly held by encroachment and adverse to the record owner for over 15 years. Traylor v. West, 255 S.W.2d 612, 1953<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 667</cite> (Ky. 1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action to establish title and right to possession of realty, instruction correctly told the jury defendants had the burden of proving they had acquired title by adverse possession for the reason that plaintiffs had first established a prima facie case as to their title. Havens v. Clem, 275 S.W.2d 70, 1954<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1244</cite> (Ky. 1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was proper to allow jury to determine whether defendants had established title to farm by adverse possession where the evidence was conflicting on this point and plaintiffs met the requirement of title by proving both conveyances derived from a common source. Havens v. Clem, 275 S.W.2d 70, 1954<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1244</cite> (Ky. 1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action to recover damages for wrongful cutting of timber, the court correctly refused to give any instruction having to do with adverse possession where plaintiff failed to show that any claim to the land in question had been made by plaintiff’s predecessor in title and, as plaintiff had purchased his land in 1947, the statutory period for adverse possession was not established. Noland v. Wise, 333 S.W.2d 501, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 190</cite> (Ky. 1960).

        Motion to file supplemental complaint on day of oral argument in United States Court of Appeals, which alleged for the first time that the period of time for bringing an action for the recovery of real estate was 15 years under this section and that the period of time had expired, was overruled, since a new issue, not raised by the pleadings in the district court or considered by it, could not be raised for the first time on appeal.

        A litigant need not anticipate in his pleading that the defense of limitation will be made and rely on matters in avoidance thereof in the same pleading but, when limitation is relied on, it must be controverted in some form, the usual method being a denial in a pleading responsive to the one containing the plea.

        The purpose of this section is not to extend the statute of limitations three (3) years in any cases save those in which the disability is not removed more than three (3) years before the expiration of the 15 years and to give such persons as are under disability at the time the cause of action accrues three (3) full years after the removal of the disability within which to bring their action.

        The statute of limitations began to run against an infant, notwithstanding his infancy, at the death of his grandmother, at which time he was by law entitled to possession of the real estate, but under this section he had three (3) years after he arrived at full age within which to assert his claim to the land and the statute, having begun to run against the infant at the death of his grandmother, continued to run against his heir. Call v. Phelps' Adm'r, 45 S.W. 1051, 20<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 507</cite> (1898).

       <p>
        As all of the adult children of decedent had disposed of their interests in their father’s estate before his death and made deeds therefor, the right of the only heir, who was an infant when the decedent died, to sue must be determined as though he alone had such right. Sharp v. Stephens' Committee, 52 S.W. 977, 21<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 687</cite>, 1899<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 356</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1899).

       <p>
        If the only disability infant labored under at the date of his intestate’s death was infancy, the disability was removed upon his arrival at 21 years of age, and if the alleged unsoundness of mind developed subsequent to the time when his cause of action first accrued, this disability cannot be added to that of infancy to extend the time for the institution of suit. Sharp v. Stephens' Committee, 52 S.W. 977, 21<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 687</cite>, 1899<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 356</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1899).

       <p>
        Under this section the right of an infant to sue is limited to 15 years where the disability of infancy is removed as much as three (3) years before the expiration of the 15 years. Sharp v. Stephens' Committee, 52 S.W. 977, 21<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 687</cite>, 1899<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 356</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1899).

        A conveyance to a woman and her children creates a life estate in the mother with remainder to her children, who become vested with the entire title on the death of their mother, so the statute of limitations would not begin to run against the minor children’s interest in the real property until their mother’s death and, if the children are infants at that time, their right of action to recover the land would not be barred until three (3) years after their disability was removed. Salyer v. Johnson, 107 S.W. 210, 32<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 709</cite> (1908).

        Action based on joint right of entry accruing to infant plaintiffs in 1891 as to which the disability of infancy was removed in 1906, not brought within three (3) years thereafter, as permitted by this section, was barred.

        One is not allowed 15 full years after arriving at 21 years of age within which to bring suit to recover real property adversely held while he was an infant but only three (3) years after he becomes 21 and this is true although the period of limitations and the extended time after the removal of the disability are partly or wholly concurrent so, if the limitation period is completed while the disability exists, suit may be brought within three (3) years after the disability is removed but if the disability is removed before the completion of the limitation period, then the extension provided by this section becomes concurrent with the running of the statute. Campbell v. Whisman, 183<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.21.html#tXXIc256" target="_blank">Ky. 256</a></cite>, 209 S.W. 27, 1919<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 470</cite> (Ky. 1919).

        Where defendant and those through whom they claimed had held the land adversely to plaintiffs for 15 years on March 27, 1912, and at that time the youngest plaintiff had been 21 years of age for nearly six (6) years, then, under this section, the time expired in 1915 and an action in ejectment filed in 1917 was barred by the statute of limitations. Campbell v. Whisman, 183<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.21.html#tXXIc256" target="_blank">Ky. 256</a></cite>, 209 S.W. 27, 1919<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 470</cite> (Ky. 1919).

       <p>
        When limitation begins to run against the right to enforce a cause of action, the running of the statute is not interrupted by reason of any subsequent event or condition and the death of an ancestor will not stop the running and, since the heirs are placed exactly in the shoes of their ancestor, the minority of descendants after the ancestor’s death will not arrest it. Henderson v. Fielder, 185<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 482</cite>, 215 S.W. 187, 1919<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 323</cite> (Ky. 1919).

        If infancy existed or is intended to be relied on, it must, like the statute of limitations, be pleaded. Adams v. Bates, 191<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 710</cite>, 231 S.W. 238, 1921<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 376</cite> (Ky. 1921).

       <p>
        Where actual possession under a void title bond was not taken until after the true title had vested in infant heir, her right of action was not tolled until three (3) years after she became 21 years of age and the limitations did not begin to run against her until then, the 30 year statute under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.030" target="_self">413.030</a></cite> not being involved.

        Action to recover land, instituted by former infant in 1945 on ground that sale by guardian in 1916 was void, was barred by statute of limitations where plaintiff had become of age in 1935.

        The 15-year limitation period begins to run when the right to institute an action for recovery of real property first occurs and this is true, notwithstanding the holder of the right is under the age of majority, in which case, he can avail himself of the saving provision of this section, if need be; but if the 15-year period extends beyond the three-year grace period, the saving provision is rendered inconsequential.

        This section did not bar committee from suit to recover land conveyed by his ward while congenitally incompetent mentally to make a contract at the time she made the conveyance and there was no change in her mental condition after the conveyance was made. Collins v. Lawson's Committee, 140<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc510" target="_blank">Ky. 510</a></cite>, 131 S.W. 262, 1910<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Where one’s right of action to recover land accrued in 1859, if he became of unsound mind after his cause of action accrued, this did not affect the running of the statute and, if he was of unsound mind when his cause of action accrued and so remained until his death in 1882, the action might have been brought within three (3) years after that time and although, when he died, his heirs at law were under disability, this did not affect the running of the statute of limitations and an action by the heirs for partition in 1908 was barred by the statute of limitations. Hale's Heirs v. Ritchie, 142<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc424" target="_blank">Ky. 424</a></cite>, 134 S.W. 474, 1911<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Although a cause of action had accrued, the 15 year statute did not run against a person who was insane at the time possession was taken adverse to him, but, where one of his heirs was not under disability at his death, an action commenced by some of the heirs 16 years after his death was barred by the statute of limitations. Turner v. Begley, 239<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.24.html#tXXIVc281" target="_blank">Ky. 281</a></cite>, 39 S.W.2d 504, 1931<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 778</cite> (Ky. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Insanity was a disability which extended the period of limitation insofar as the 15 year statute was involved, but it had no effect upon the accrual of his right of action, since a cause of action accrues when the right to institute and maintain a suit arises, and it is not dependent upon the capacity of the person in whose favor the right exists.

        Since the remainderman has no right of possession until the particular estate is terminated, the general rule is that laches, estoppel, or the statute of limitations will not run against a remainderman prior to the termination of the life tenancy; but there are exceptions to this general rule where the life tenant undertakes to dispose of, or enlarge upon the estate and brings home to the remainderman notice of the adverse holding in such manner as to indicate a repudiation of life tenancy or where the person under whom the remainderman asserts a derivative right undertakes to transfer title to the real estate, in which case possession thereunder for the statutory period bars the remainderman’s right to recover the land.

        This section was intended to prescribe the period of 30 years as the limit beyond which the right to bring an action for the recovery of real property should not be extended, even to a person laboring under disability when the cause first accrued. Bradley v. Burgess, 87<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 648</cite>, 10 S.W. 5, 10<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 701</cite>, 1888<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 122</cite> (Ky. 1888).

       <p>
        The statute of limitations as to actions for the recovery of real estate by analogy are applicable and should be applied to actions to restore or perpetuate evidence of title to real estate and in no case can the right to bring such an action continue more than 30 years after the cause of action accrues. Brandenburg v. McGuire, 105<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 10</cite>, 44 S.W. 96, 19<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1598</cite>, 1898<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 239</cite> (Ky. 1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not apply to adverse possession by surface owner of mineral and mining rights severed from the surface, since KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc381s381.430" target="_blank">381.430</a></cite> controls such rights and a person who holds the surface cannot hold the mineral rights by adverse possession. Farnsworth v. Barret, 146<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 556</cite>, 142 S.W. 1049, 1912<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 104</cite> (Ky. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not apply to remaindermen until the death of the life tenant, since all statutes of limitation begin to run from the accrual of the cause of action and a remainderman has no right to entry and no cause of action until the death of the life tenant, since being a remainderman is not a disability. Superior Oil Corp. v. Alcorn, 242<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 814</cite>, 47 S.W.2d 973, 1930<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 855</cite> (Ky. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute fixing time within which action for recovery of realty must be brought could not be invoked by plaintiff in quiet title action, where no adverse possession by him had been shown. Hale v. Horn, 265<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 560</cite>, 97 S.W.2d 402, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 533</cite> (Ky. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has no application, since the possession by one tenant in common or joint tenant is deemed to be the possession of his cotenants also, and the one in possession cannot acquire title by adverse possession as against his cotenants unless they have notice or knowledge that he denies their possession and claims adversely to them. Fordson Coal Co. v. Vanover, 291<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXXXXIc447" target="_blank">Ky. 447</a></cite>, 164 S.W.2d 966, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        If, at any time after her father’s death, his daughter could have ignored his sale of land and repudiated the title bond by action to recover the land, the same right could have been asserted by her father before his death and, if so, the cause of action to recover the land would have accrued before his death, and suit might then have been brought; therefore, the statute would have commenced to run before his death; consequently, it was not suspended at his death during the time the daughter was a minor. Doty v. Jameson, 93 S.W. 638, 29<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 507</cite> (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where all remaindermen heirs are under disability at the time of the death of the life tenant, the 15 year statute of limitations provided by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.010" target="_self">413.010</a></cite> does not begin to run until the disability is removed from all, even the youngest.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where certain heirs who were remaindermen were sui juris at the time of the death of the life tenant and others were under disability, the 15 year statute of limitations provided by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.010" target="_self">413.010</a></cite> began to run in favor of grantee of life tenant against all immediately upon the death of the life tenant.

       </p>
       <p>
        If any of heirs are free from disability when a right of entry accrues to the heirs, the statute starts and the disability of others does not prevent the statute from running against all of the class. Turner v. Begley, 239<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.24.html#tXXIVc281" target="_blank">Ky. 281</a></cite>, 39 S.W.2d 504, 1931<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 778</cite> (Ky. 1931).

        Where evidence was that one (1) of four (4) joint owners did not sign deed under which defendant claimed, 30 year statute of limitations did not bar heirs of such owner from bringing action for partition, since defendant in such case was joint tenant with plaintiffs and, in the absence of notice to the plaintiffs, could not claim that his possession was adverse to them. Fordson Coal Co. v. Vanover, 291<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXXXXIc447" target="_blank">Ky. 447</a></cite>, 164 S.W.2d 966, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Where land was jointly occupied by father and children and the children claimed an interest in the land on the ground that a deed from their deceased mother to their father was invalid, the father could not claim title by adverse possession against the children.

        A cause of action to restore or perpetuate evidence of title to real estate accrues upon the destruction or mutilation of the deed or writing sought to be supplied and the statute commences to run from such destruction, or at least as soon as the loss is discovered, or could by the exercise of reasonable diligence have been discovered by the plaintiff.

        Since the remainderman has no right of possession until the particular estate is terminated, the general rule is that laches, estoppel, or the statute of limitations will not run against a remainderman prior to the termination of the life tenancy. Brittenum v. Cunningham, 310<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc131" target="_blank">Ky. 131</a></cite>, 220 S.W.2d 100, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Where mortgagor conveyed mortgaged realty to daughter-in-law for life with remainder to son’s heirs and then the mortgagee foreclosed, bought in land at sale, ousted life tenant and remaindermen and took possession under a commissioner’s deed, there was a “falling in” of the life estate at that time and action by remaindermen to recover land 49 years later was barred by the statute of limitations even though the life tenant had died only seven years before. Brittenum v. Cunningham, 310<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc131" target="_blank">Ky. 131</a></cite>, 220 S.W.2d 100, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        No disability because of infancy, or because war exists between the claimant’s country and that of the defendant, or because of any other “disability whatever,” can save the right to bring an action for the recovery of real property adversely held for a longer period than 30 years from the time the right of action first accrued to them.

        Under this section the period within which an action for the recovery of real property may be brought shall not, in any case, be extended beyond 30 years from the time the cause of action accrued by reason of any death or the existence or continuance of any disability and the statute, in this case, having begun to run, and more than 30 years having elapsed after the cause of action accrued, the bar of the statute was complete.

        The 30 year statute bars all claims, without regard to disability, where there was a right of action in the claimants. Dixon v. Harris, 105 S.W. 451, 32<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 275</cite> (1907).

        When grantee entered and held land adversely under a void deed, the cause of action to recover land accrued to grantee and, when she died, it descended to her daughter and no action to recover the land having been brought in 30 years after the cause of action accrued, further actions were barred although all the parties were at all times under disability.

        Where evidence showed actual, visible, adverse possession of disputed land began during life of alleged owner, the statute of limitations as to him commenced in his lifetime and infancy of his children occurring after the commencement of the operation of the statute of limitations did not suspend the statute of limitations, so an action by his children to recover the land brought more than 30 years after the commencement of the statute of limitations would be barred by this section.

        The principle allowing the acquisition of easements in streets by adverse user of the public and the loss of such easements by the public by adverse possession of another of a street dedicated to the public use remains unchanged, except for the law, which provided that the statute of limitations will not begin to run in favor of an individual against a town or city for the use or possession of a street until the party who relies or intends to rely upon adverse possession of it has given the authorities of the municipality notice of his intentions.

        This section did not apply to land owned by the city as a cemetery and held adversely by the Catholic church for over 40 years, as the word “easement” cannot be extended to embrace lands to which the city or town has a fee-simple title without upsetting all recognized definitions of the word “easement.” Franklin v.

        In an action to recover damages from city for the alleged wrongful taking of a strip of ground eight feet in width abutting a public highway which was outside the calls of plaintiff’s deed but which plaintiff had fenced, taking in part of the public right of way, it was incumbent on plaintiff, under this section, to prove notice of her adverse holding in the face of the fact that the very survey on which the description of her property was based recognized the public interest in the eight-foot strip of land in question. Ashland v. Wyle, 265<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc340" target="_blank">Ky. 340</a></cite>, 96 S.W.2d 850, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 476</cite> (Ky. 1936).

        No notice of adverse claim to dedicated street having been given to city since its incorporation in 1878, the statutes of limitation, under this section were inoperative, and whether or not the actual acceptance was made by the municipality by ordinance or improvement or otherwise was immaterial, since the potential right to accept whenever desired had existed under the deed of dedication ever since the incorporation of the city, against which limitation did not run in the absence of the required notice.

        This section was not repealed by statute which was held unconstitutional and invalid because it violated the provisions of Ky.

        Where tract of land was divided into lots with two (2) streets running north and south and plat was filed in county clerk’s office although the streets were not dedicated in the statutory sense, they were dedicated in the sense that the dedication inured to the benefit of the public and the public, particularly contiguous property owners, had a right to use them and such right could not be destroyed by mere encroachment by the owner of abutting property; thus, in action to compel the removal of obstructions and the opening up of the streets, failure of appellee to comply with this section defeated his contention that he had right to obstruct street because of adverse possession.

        Failure to allege in petition to recover damages for trespass that plaintiffs had adverse possession for the required time prior to enactment of this statute was cured by verdict in favor of plaintiffs where evidence received without objection showed that for 20 or 25 years prior to enactment of this section, plaintiffs and those through whom they claimed had had that portion of their lot claimed to be a part of the city’s streets inclosed by a fence and the issue of adverse possession for 15 years prior to 1873, when this section was enacted, was submitted to the jury.

        While grantor was in possession, he had the right to regard the deed simply as security until such time as the grantee or his successors in interest deprived or attempted to deprive him of the possession and the statute of limitations would not begin to run or laches be imputed to the grantor until then.

        Where mortgagor conveyed mortgaged realty to daughter-in-law for life with remainder to son’s heirs and then the mortgagee foreclosed, bought in land at sale, ousted life tenant and remaindermen and took possession under a commissioner’s deed, there was a “falling in” of the life estate at that time and action by remaindermen to recover land 49 years later was barred by the statute of limitations even though the life tenant had died only seven years before.

       It is the declared policy of the Commonwealth to conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural land and silvicultural land for the production of food, timber, and other agricultural and silvicultural products. When nonagricultural land uses extend into agricultural and silvicultural areas, agricultural and silvicultural operations often become the subject of nuisance suits or legal actions restricting agricultural or silvicultural operations. As a result, agricultural and silvicultural operations are sometimes either curtailed or forced to cease operations. Investments in farm and timber improvements may be discouraged. It is the purpose of this section to reduce the loss to the state of its agricultural and silvicultural resources by clarifying the circumstances under which agricultural and silvicultural operations may be deemed to be a nuisance or interfered with by local ordinances or legal actions.

        Federal district court properly dismissed as time-barred a widow’s action under 29 USCS § 1132(a)(1)(B), which sought to recover survivor benefits under her deceased husband’s retirement plan; the widow’s claim of an invalid waiver of survivor benefits arose from ERISA’s statutory protections rather than from an independent contract between the parties and, thus, the district court properly concluded that the most analogous Kentucky statute of limitations was KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120ol12" target="_self">413.120(2)</a></cite>, which was the five-year statute of limitations for an action upon liability created by statute, rather than KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.090ol12" target="_self">413.090(2)</a></cite>, which was the 15-year statute of limitations for breach of a written contract.

        Privilege fees imposed by ordinance for the construction of a sanitary sewer trunk line were in the nature of a special assessment rather than a contractual obligation; thus, a collection action was subject to the five-year limitations period for collecting an assessment qualifying as a statutory liability, and the statute of limitations for contract actions was inapplicable even though some owners had entered into an agreement to pay the fees.

        In absence of an applicable federal statute, the state statute of limitations controls; thus, this section is the Kentucky statute applicable to an action by the United States for breach of a written contract and, when the action is brought within the 15 year period, it is not barred.

        Statutes of limitation, though they might be considered as founded in a sound public policy, nevertheless have the effect of destroying all remedy for the enforcement of rights, and for which reason it should plainly appear that a case in which the statute of limitations is pleaded is one to which the limitation relied on is applicable.

        In respect of issues of which courts of equity have exclusive jurisdiction, where the enforcement of the claim depends upon the conscience of the chancellor, equity may refuse relief by applying the doctrine of laches, even though the claim be not barred by the statute of limitations. But where the issue is a legal one and does not lie within the conscience of the chancellor, the statute fixing the limitation establishes the rule to be applied, and the defense of laches may not be interposed. On issues of which courts of equity and courts of law have concurrent jurisdiction, the statute of limitations will be applied by the court of equity precisely as it operates at law. Gover's Adm'r v.

        There is no statute prescribing the time within which a claim for a loss under a policy of indemnity may be filed, or forbidding the surety from placing in the policy a provision limiting the time.

        A contract providing a shorter limitation period than that prescribed by statute is valid, if the contract period is reasonable. Burlew v.

        It is not contrary to public policy for parties to contract for a reasonably shorter period than that fixed by the statute. Johnson v. Calvert Fire Ins. Co., 298<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 669</cite>, 183 S.W.2d 941, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1071</cite> (Ky. 1944).

        Parties dealing at arm’s length may contract for a limitation shorter than that provided by statute, so long as the period is a reasonable one. Prewitt v. Supreme Council, R.

        Where, at time life insurance policy containing a three (3) year limitation clause was issued, Court of Appeals was upholding the rule that parties dealing at arm’s length may contract for a reasonable limitation shorter than the statutory provision, the rule would be applicable in an action on this policy, though at a later date, on which the policy was reissued, the court was temporarily adopting the opposite view, holding it contrary to public policy to contravene the statutory limitation. Prewitt v. Supreme Council, R. A., 302<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc301" target="_blank">Ky. 301</a></cite>, 194 S.W.2d 633, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        There is no conflict between subdivision (2) of this section providing a 15-year statute of limitations for actions on contracts, and a provision in an insurance contract requiring suits be commenced within 12 months, especially in light of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc304s304.14-370" target="_blank">304.14-370</a></cite> which specifically allows such provisions for contracts by foreign insurers.

       <p>
        Although there is a 15 years general statute of limitation affecting contracts, such can, under law, be limited if such restriction is shown to have been the intention of the parties as determined by proper arm’s length bargaining. Green v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 601 S.W.2d 612, 1980<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 335</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).

        The decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in Elkins v. Kentucky Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 844 S.W.2d 423, 1992<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 128</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1992), which held that an action against one’s uninsured-motorist carrier must be brought within the two-year period provided by the Motor Vehicle Reparations Act, is not applicable to an action on a first-party insurance contract; the applicable statute of limitations for general actions on a written contract is fifteen (15) years, but insurance companies are not prohibited from contracting with their insureds for a shorter period of time to file a contractual claim, as long as such period of time is “reasonable” as required under Elkins. Gordon v. Kentucky Farm Bureau Ins. Co., 914 S.W.2d 331, 1995<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 120</cite> (Ky. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in finding an injured police officer’s claim for underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits was time-barred, because a contractual limitation for filing a UIM claim that mirrored the two-year tort statute of limitations period was unreasonable. Thus, the fifteen-year statutory period for contract claims applied.

        A surety who pays a judgment for his principal without taking an assignment of the judgment against the principal that he paid can only recover from his principal upon the implied promise that the law raises in his behalf and he must proceed to obtain relief upon this implied promise within five (5) years from the date of the payment; but, when a surety takes a statutory assignment of a judgment against his principal within five (5) years from its rendition, he steps into the shoes of the judgment plaintiff and has all the rights against his principal that the judgment plaintiff would have.

        Where, in order to withdraw from hands of trustee certain funds, a petitioner listed his debts for the benefit of the court, and the court, in allowing the funds to be withdrawn, directed that the petitioner pay the debts, but the creditors were not parties to this action and no judgment was entered in their favor, the debts listed by the petitioner were not put on the footing of judgments in order that the 15 year statute of limitations would apply. Furthermore, the listing of the debts did not constitute a “written contract” within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section; thus, a debt based on an oral contract was barred in five (5) years.

        An action by the husband against the administrator of the estate of his deceased ex-wife and the executor of the estate of his wife’s mother seeking restoration of certain property given by him to his ex-wife during their marriage was held to be an action to enforce a judgment, governed by a 15-year statute of limitations, rather than an action based upon a liability created by statute, which was governed by a 5-year statute of limitations.

        This section was the applicable statute of limitations on a motion for a judgment on delinquent child support arrearages owing under a divorce decree, and the statute would not begin to run until such time as the delinquency was reduced to a lump sum payment or until emancipation of the child, whichever was the former.

        Since matters of maintenance and child support have the same effect as a money judgment for which subdivision (1) of this section has established a 15-year period in which an action on such judgment shall be brought, equitable defenses of laches or estoppel by acquiescence are not available to bar collection of maintenance and child support arrearages.

        Although debtor may have given his sureties the information that they were not liable for the whole amount of the claim which appellee asserted against him and aided them in proving it, yet, as the injunction did not suspend the collection of the judgment as to him, it cannot be said that he obstructed the collection of the judgment, so as to prevent the running of the statute of limitations pending that litigation and the statute of limitations barred plaintiff’s right to maintain an action on the judgment.

        As more than 15 years had elapsed after return of the first execution before the second execution was issued, the statute of limitations operated as a bar to the latter and it was illegal; thus, partial payment of the second execution did not revive the barred judgment since no act of debtor short of an express or clearly implied promise to satisfy the residue of the judgment, founded on moral obligation to do so, could have operated to revive it or entitle plaintiffs to an execution on it.

        An execution issued on a judgment against several judgment debtors after the death of one of the judgment debtors, although good against the survivors, is void as to the deceased judgment debtor, stops the running of the statute of limitations and cannot be enforced against his representative until it is revived.

        After an execution on a judgment has been returned “No property found,” the judgment creditor has two (2) ways to keep the judgment alive: (1) he may keep it alive indefinitely by causing executions to issue on it from time to time within the period prescribed by the statute; or (2) he may keep it alive indefinitely by commencing an action on the judgment under subsection (1) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.39.html#tXXXIXc426s426.381" target="_blank">426.381</a></cite> within the time and manner prescribed and keeping the action on the docket.

        An assignment by judgment debtor made in pursuance of a separate agreement and transaction between the parties prior to rendition of the judgment which made no mention of the judgment debt could not be treated as an acknowledgment of the debt evidenced by the judgment sued on so as to toll the statute of limitations.

        While ordinarily the defense of the statute of limitations must be pleaded by the defendant, in an action to enforce the satisfaction of judgments, it is necessary for the plaintiff to show affirmatively that the action is based on a return of no property found, made on a valid execution, that is, an execution issued before the judgment was barred by the statute of limitations.

        When a deed retains a lien to secure the payment of a purchase-money note, although the record discloses that more than 15 years elapsed since the maturity of the note, the lien still exists if there have been payments made on the note keeping it alive and renewing the purchase-money note from time to time has the same effect.

        Indorsement and payment of holder’s note by maker of three (3) notes constituted a payment of maker’s own three (3) notes as of the time of his indorsement of holder’s notes which suspended the running of the statute of limitations.

        In the case of a promissory note not placed on the footing of a bill of exchange, the period of limitation is 15 years but a payment on the note is a sufficient acknowledgment of the debt to stop the running of the statute up to that time, and the period of limitation will then be computed from the date of the payment.

        There was sufficient acknowledgment of the debt to suspend the running of the statute of limitations up to that time where a sum received by the holder from a person other than the maker was credited on a note as a gift by way of indorsement under an agreement between the maker and the holder.

        To stop the running of the statute of limitations on a note, if payments represented by the credits on the note are denied by the maker, the burden is on the holder of the note to show that the payments were made at the time they purport to have been made, or at least within 15 years from the time the note became due.

        In an action to recover on a promissory note, where plaintiff’s claim on the note and defendant’s defense of payment were both originally items of the same open account and both grew out of the mutuality of interrelated business dealings between these parties, the trial court committed prejudicial error in directing a verdict for plaintiff based upon the assumed merit of the plaintiff’s reply in which he pleaded limitations as a complete bar against the defense of payment set up by the defendant. The court should have submitted the whole case, including defendant’s defense of payment of the note, to the jury for decision. Liter v.

        Statute of limitations for breach of contract claims by a coal property owner against the holder of oil and gas interests began to run when a well was drilled, not when it was mined, as any breach of deeds occurred by the holder drilling the wells without approval and in a manner that interfered more than as little as reasonably possible with the owner’s coal operations.

        Where a settlement of accounts was made and the obligation reduced to writing and signed by obligor and acknowledged by the obligor in affixing his signature to obligee’s itemized account eight (8) years before obligor’s death, the written acknowledgment tolled the running of the statute of limitations until the day after the acknowledgment of the debt.

        In an action to enforce mortgage calling on defendants to assert liens, the filing within the 15-year statutory period by defendant of a cross petition setting forth an improvement lien interrupted the running of the statute of limitations even though a summons was not issued on the cross complaint, since no personal judgment was sought and plaintiff was barred from a plea of limitations in a subsequent consolidated action.

        Where the debtor dies more thanone (1) year before the time limited for the commencement of the action, and an administrator is appointed more thanone (1) year before the time limited for the commencement of the action, the time in which the action may be brought is limited to the time prescribed in this section or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120" target="_self">413.120</a></cite>, whichever may be applicable, and the six-month impediment to the bringing of a suit provided in law requiring period of five (5) months after qualification of a personal representative before an action can be brought against an administrator or executor does not prevent the statute from running during that six (6) months.

        After an action against executrix and mortgage creditor, in which creditor properly set up his debt long before the 15 year statutory period ran out, was consolidated with action by widow for settlement of estate in which she alleged the justice of the mortgage debt, it was unnecessary for the mortgage creditor to answer in the second action and set out his debt again in order to stop the running of the statute of limitations and the heirs could not appear in the second action 15 years after the mortgage was executed and defeat it by a plea of limitation.

        Where defendant responded in his answer to the original petition in a suit to set aside a deed and compel an accounting and, in addition to traversing the allegations of the petition, pleaded and relied on the statute of limitations and plaintiff joined issues thereon, this traverse of the plea of the statute of limitations was bad and it interposed no real defense to the plea.

      No promise, acknowledgment or payment of money by any person bound on any bond or obligation for the payment of money secured by a lien shall operate as a prolongation or extension of the time within which the lien may be enforced as against purchasers or creditors, unless the promisor and the holder of the lien, before fifteen (15) years after the maturity of the debt, enters a memorandum on the margin of the record of the deed or mortgage, attested by the clerk, showing that the debt is extended, for what time it is extended and the amount still due thereon. The payee shall pay the clerk a fee pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.012" target="_blank">64.012</a></cite> for his services.

        The fundamental principle back of these recording statutes is to protect bona fide purchasers and creditors without notice. Head v. Oldham Bank &amp; Trust Co., 249<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc292" target="_blank">Ky. 292</a></cite>, 60 S.W.2d 621, 1933<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        This section was not intended to and does not operate to affect the prolongation of a lien indebtedness as between the parties, but left that untouched, the purpose and intent of this section being for the protection of third parties and to require that a record of the prolongation of lien indebtedness be made as required by the statute so that those who do not have actual knowledge thereof may rely on what the record discloses. Barriger v. Martin, 259<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc406" target="_blank">Ky. 406</a></cite>, 82 S.W.2d 450, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        By failing to except chattel mortgages from the provisions of this section, it would indicate Legislature considered chattel mortgages as being valid for a period of 15 years. In re Ciabattari, 29 F. Supp. 573, 1939 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2082 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1939</cite>).

        While it is true this section does not have incorporated the words “without notice” or words of like import after the words “purchaser” or “purchasers and creditors,” the intent of the Legislature was to invalidate extensions caused by payments on or acknowledgments of lien debts only as to purchasers and creditors without notice.

        The rights of subsequent mortgagee under mortgage acquired before 15 years after maturity of prior mortgage indebtedness and her rights under this section were fixed as of that date and did not operate to give her priority over prior mortgage merely because of subsequent failure of the parties to the prior mortgage to comply with this section.

        Mortgage executed in 1885 and duly recorded was superior to a subsequent mortgage executed on the property in 1925 although no memorandum on the margin of the record was ever entered showing that the debt was extended or for what time or the amount due thereon where the pleadings disclosed the subsequent mortgagee took with actual knowledge of the 1885 mortgage lien and the affirmative defense of bona fide purchaser for value without notice was not set up in the pleadings.

        The object rather than the form of the action controls in determining the period of limitation; thus, where a statute limits the time in which an action for injuries to the person may be brought, the statute is applicable for all actions the real purpose of which is to recover for an injury to the person, whether based upon contract or tort, in preference to a general statute limiting the time for bringing actions ex contractu.

        Taxes for 1932 were not barred by five (5) year statute of limitations under this section although they became in arrears November 1, 1932, and suit was not instituted by city until February 10, 1938, where sale to enforce collection of delinquent taxes was not declared invalid prior to litigation to have such taxes declared liens on taxpayers’ realty.

         6. — Street Improvement Assessments.
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section applied to an action against a city wherein its liability arose because of its failure to enact proper assessment ordinances making it guilty of negligent breach of duty. Heydinger v. Catlettsburg, 114 F. Supp. 294, 1953 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3963 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1953</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cause of action against the owner of property sought to be subjected to lien for a street improvement by a city of the third class accrued when the common council received and approved the work under contract and, as an action was not instituted within five (5) years from that date, the statute of limitations presented a complete bar to any recovery. Waggoner v. Board of Councilmen, 99 S.W. 918, 30<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 847</cite> (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        An action by a city to recover assessments for street improvements was a liability created by statute to which the five-year statute of limitations applied. Covington v. Patterson, 191<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 370</cite>, 230 S.W. 542, 1921<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 329</cite> (Ky. 1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        To suspend or stop the statute of new limitations, an acknowledgment or new promise of taxpayer to pay street improvement assessment must be proven to have been made to the city, or someone acting for it, with authority to enforce the liens or to collect and receipt for the assessment taxes. Thornton's Adm'r v. Minton's Ex'r, 250<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 805</cite>, 64 S.W.2d 158, 1933<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 789</cite> (Ky. 1933). See Louisa v. Horton, 263<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 739</cite>, 93 S.W.2d 620, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 802</cite> (Ky. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        As each annual installment of street improvement assessment matured, to prevent the running of the five-year statute of limitations as to an installment in default, the holder of the bond was under the duty to enforce the collection thereof within five (5) years and 30 days after its maturity; otherwise, the same would be barred, at the expiration of five (5) years, by the five-year statute of limitations. Middlesboro v. Terrell, 259<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc47" target="_blank">Ky. 47</a></cite>, 81 S.W.2d 865, 1934<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 588</cite> (Ky. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        The lien on owner’s lots for paving assessments is purely a statutory one and exists independently of owner’s written agreement to pay the assessments on the ten-year installment plan; thus, the five-year statute of limitations applies and any installments which mature within the five (5) years immediately preceding action to enforce or collect them are not barred by the five-year statute of limitations. Middlesboro v. Terrell, 259<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc47" target="_blank">Ky. 47</a></cite>, 81 S.W.2d 865, 1934<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

Evans, 261<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc303" target="_blank">Ky. 303</a></cite>, 87 S.W.2d 352, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 613</cite> (Ky. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Five-year statute of limitations applies to a cause of action by bondholders against city for damages for negligent breach of duty in failing to enforce collection of assessments. Catlettsburg v. Trapp, 261<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc347" target="_blank">Ky. 347</a></cite>, 87 S.W.2d 621, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 644</cite> (Ky. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        The liability of property for the costs of street improvements is statutory and the limitations prescribed by this section which is applicable and controlling begins to run 30 days after the first installment on each improvement is due. Louisa v. Horton, 263<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 739</cite>, 93 S.W.2d 620, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 802</cite> (Ky. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action on a contract made by a city and a paving contractor, pursuant to street improvement law, is not an action based on “a liability created by statute,” within the meaning of this section. Hunt v. Ashland, 274<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 567</cite>, 119 S.W.2d 640, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 300</cite> (Ky. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a lien for a street improvement in a first-class city exists from the date of the apportionment warrant and a suit to enforce the lien must be instituted within five (5) years from the date the warrant is issued, suit instituted to correct the apportionment soon after it was made tolled the statute of limitations during the litigation. Breslin v. Gray, 283<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 785</cite>, 143 S.W.2d 452, 1940<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 409</cite> (Ky. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to toll the statute of limitations on an action to foreclose street improvement lien, it must be shown the property owner unequivocally acknowledged the claim and that the person with whom he offered to settle was authorized to act for the city. Olive Hill v. Gearhart, 289<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 53</cite>, 157 S.W.2d 481, 1941<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 13</cite> (Ky. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        In suit by city against abutting property owners seeking to enforce street improvement liens, it was incumbent upon defendants pleading the five (5) year statute of limitations to produce evidence concerning assessments and payments thereon to sustain their plea and, having failed, it was properly denied and, where defendant’s allegation was negative in form, plaintiff’s denial in the same form was deemed sufficient and it was not a negative pregnant admitting the plea. Jordan v. Olive Hill, 290<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 828</cite>, 162 S.W.2d 229, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 473</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        A drainage assessment lien is a liability created by statute, rather than one created by judgment, so an action to enforce the lien is governed by the five (5) year statute of limitations.

        Action by receiver of insolvent national bank to enforce liability of stockholders under comptroller’s assessment is governed by statute of limitations of state in which action is brought. Cope v. Anderson, 331 U.S. 461, 67 S. Ct. 1340, 91 L. Ed. 1602, 1947 U.S. LEXIS 2849 (U.S. 1947).

        By means of the “borrowing statutes” of Ohio and Pennsylvania, this section was applied to defeat suit commenced more than five (5) years after date fixed by comptroller for payment against Ohio and Pennsylvania residents to enforce their statutory double liability on shares of an insolvent Kentucky national bank. Cope v. Anderson, 331 U.S. 461, 67 S. Ct. 1340, 91 L. Ed. 1602, 1947 U.S. LEXIS 2849 (U.S. 1947).

        Cause of action against stockholder of defunct national bank, to recover on assessment against stockholders made by comptroller of currency, arose in Kentucky where bank was authorized to operate, where receiver’s office was located and where shareholders were notified by the receiver to pay, with result that action was governed by Kentucky statute of limitations because of provision, in statute of limitations of state in which stockholder resided and in which action was brought, barring action in such state when barred in state in which cause of action arose.

        A complaint under 42 USCS §§ 1983 and 1985 alleging that plaintiffs’ neighbors and local officials had conspired to bring false charges against plaintiffs was most closely analogous to a state action for malicious prosecution, and therefore KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140" target="_self">413.140</a></cite> rather than this section provided the applicable statute of limitations.

        Although an action for deprivation of due process in connection with failure to renew a nontenured teacher’s contract could not be brought in the absence of the employment relation and a legitimate expectancy of reemployment, the primary interest which the due process right served to protect was the interest in plaintiff’s reputation, and not a contractual interest; thus the civil rights action was analogous to a state cause of action for slander and was therefore subject to the one-year statute of limitations.

        Payments at intervals by decedent made to niece for caring for decedent should be credited on account for respective years in which niece furnished services, and do not take claim out of statute of limitations.

        The trial court properly confined the evidence and should limit the recovery for a promise to pay for services by testamentary bequest to a period of five (5) years with the payments made from time to time credited on the account for the respective years in which they were made and they cannot be considered as taking the claim out of the statute of limitations.

        Statements made by decedent to the effect that he intended to leave plaintiff a part of his estate or that he intended to show his appreciation for her services by leaving her a part of his property fell far short of establishing an implied contract with her for payment by testamentary bequest which could avoid the bar of the five (5) year statute of limitations.

        The court properly instructed the jury, as a matter of law, that embankment built by power company, in which openings could not be constructed without excessive and disproportionate expense, was a permanent structure and an action brought in 1934 to recover damages for injuries to property due to flooding was barred by the five-year statute of limitations under this section where the first injury had occurred in 1927.

        Where the injury or nuisance complained of is permanent, the measure of damages is the depreciation in the market value of the property, and limitation begins to run from completion of the improvement or the structure that caused the injury, and the action is barred in five (5) years from that time, and all the damages for past, present, and future injuries must be recovered in one action. Louisville Hydro-Electric Co. v. Coburn, 270<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 624</cite>, 110 S.W.2d 445, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 138</cite> (Ky. 1937).

       <p>
        For damages arising from a properly built and permanent structure, there must be one suit and one recovery for all damages, past, present and future, and statute of limitations begins to run when structure is completed, but if structure is temporary, successive actions may be maintained for five-year period next preceding the instigation of the action.

        If the structure is one which may not be readily remedied, removed or abated, at reasonable expense, or is of durable character intended to last indefinitely, it is permanent and only one recovery may be had for all damages sustained and the cause of action accrues when such structure is completed.

        The rule that should be applied in order to determine whether the slate piled on the graves of plaintiff’s children was a permanent trespass for which only one recovery could be had for all damages sustained and to which the five-year statute of limitations under this section applied was a determination of whether the slate pile is and was of such a nature that it could be removed only at prohibitive expense.

        Until evidence was produced and the classification of the structure as temporary or permanent established, it was impossible to decide whether the five (5) year statute of limitations which applies to cases where a permanent structure is involved was a bar to an action for trespass for dumping slate and or refuse on graves of plaintiff’s children or whether recovery should be permitted on the theory that it was a continuing invasion which condition permitted recovery during the last five (5) years immediately preceding the instigation of the action.

        Where issue made in the evidence and presented to the jury by the instructions was upon the question whether the construction of culvert was proper and skillful although plaintiff in an action against a railroad company alleged the company wrongfully, unlawfully and negligently opened a culvert, it followed that the injury resulting from collecting the surface water upon the land opposite and casting it in a body upon plaintiff’s land was not to be considered as of a permanent character, but each overflow was a distinct trespass, and the statute of limitations began to run only from the time when the overflow occurred. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Cornelius, 111<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 752</cite>, 64 S.W. 732, 23<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1069</cite>, 1901<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        In determining whether a nuisance is permanent or temporary, the question is not whether the defendant failed to exercise due care in the construction, maintenance or operation of a structure but whether the cause of the nuisance results from some improper installation or method of operation which can be remedied at reasonable expense and, if so, the nuisance is a temporary one and a claim for damages caused by it is not barred by this section.

        The stopping up of a sewer was not necessarily a permanent and continuing nuisance since the expenditure of a small amount of labor and money would have cleaned out the sewer and caused the water to flow through its natural channel; thus, five (5) year statute of limitations applied and commenced to run at the time of injuries to property occurred through city’s negligence in allowing a drainpipe to fill causing surface water to flow onto and injure property abutting on an alley.

        The five-year limitation provided in this section was applicable only to notes negotiated before maturity and in the hands of a third party, the 15-year statute being applicable as to the principals and the seven-year statute as to the sureties so long as the instrument remains in the hands of the original payee.

        Notes which were not only negotiable but which were actually negotiated before their maturity were placed upon the footing of a bill of exchange and, as suit was not brought within five (5) years after the notes matured, they were barred by the five (5) year limitation and that being true, the lien which they secured was also barred.

        The five-year statute of limitations applies only to bills and notes placed on the footing of a bill of exchange and the only way a note may be placed on the footing of a bill of exchange is by its negotiation in good faith for value and before maturity.

        This section had no application to a suit in equity brought in federal court seeking relief on account of fraud. Massachusetts Protective Asso. v. Stephenson, 5 F. Supp. 586, 1933 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1079 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1933</cite>).

        The statute of limitations applicable to actions for relief from fraud or mistake does not operate to perfect the title of the grantee in a fraudulent conveyance who has never been in possession.

        Where suit was brought on an obligation based on and growing out of settlement by a trustee and defendant pleaded that by mistake he was charged in that settlement with certain items which should not have been charged against him, that these items were included in the note sued on, and that the note to that extent was without consideration, his plea was a mere defense to which the statute of limitations interposed by plaintiff was not applicable.

        Plaintiff, in action for shortage in acreage, failed to prove that he could not have discovered by exercise of reasonable diligence that the alleged shortage existed before the five-year statute of limitations had run and his right of action was barred.

        Since more than seven (7) years had elapsed between the final payment and the filing of suit, action of purchaser for shortage in acreage was barred by the five (5) year statute unless he could show that by the exercise of ordinary diligence and prudence, he did not and could not have discovered the shortage alleged sooner than five (5) years before filing suit.

        Payment was made to seller by purchaser when he assumed seller’s mortgage debt by executing a note to mortgagee bank and seller delivered him a deed acknowledging receipt of other consideration and the statute of limitations commenced running on an action by purchaser for shortage in acreage at that time, it being immaterial as to when purchaser paid the note.

        Since purchaser’s action to recover for shortage in acreage was based on an implied promise to repay the part of the purchase money paid by mistake, the five (5) year statute of limitations commenced running when the purchase money was fully paid upon delivery of the deed.

        Former salesman’s election to plead part of his case as a common law breach of contract and fraud relieved him of the KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120ol112" target="_self">413.120(12)</a></cite> statute of limitations which applied to statutory claims, but also foreclosed him from the liquidated damages and attorneys fees provided for by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc337s337.385ol11" target="_blank">337.385(1)</a></cite>. Any other result seemed unfair because it would have allowed a plaintiff to characterize his claim as a common law claim for purposes of an advantageous statute of limitations, but as a statutory claim for purposes of statutory liquidated damages and attorneys fees.

        In action by railroad employee against voluntary relief department for compensation for injuries, where an award made more than eight (8) years previously by advisory committee was set up as a bar, a reply, alleging fraud or mistake in the award but not containing any allegation that the alleged fraud or mistake was not known from the time the decision was rendered or that it had been discovered within five (5) years last past or by the exercise of reasonable diligence could not have been sooner discovered, was barred by limitation.

        Ordinarily, limitations to be available must be pleaded, but, where action is brought for relief from fraud or mistake, after five (5) years, plaintiff must allege facts excusing delay, in order to state cause of action.

        The question of imitation cannot be raised by demurrer but it must be pleaded in order for a party to avail himself of it; thus, the fact that it appeared in the petition that the attack upon a conveyance was made after the expiration of five (5) years from its execution and that the attacking creditor did not allege that he could not by ordinary diligence have ascertained the fraud within five (5) years from the execution of the conveyance was not ground for demurrer.

        Promises made before a debt was barred, or acknowledgments made, served to suspend the running of the statute, to prolong the statutory limitation, by cutting off the antecedent time. Therefore, if as much as five (5) years had not elapsed between any renewal of promise or acknowledgment of the obligation, the action would rest upon the original undertaking and it was not necessary to prove such a positive and unqualified acknowledgment as was required where the action was upon the new promise. Rankin v. Anderson, 69 S.W. 705, 24<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 647</cite>, 1902<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 493</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to remove the bar interposed by the statute of limitations, an express promise to pay, or an acknowledgment made to the creditor or someone acting for him, of the debt as a debt due at the time, coupled with the original consideration, must have been made within the time limited by the statute for bringing the action. Dowell v. Dowell's Adm'r, 137<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc167" target="_blank">Ky. 167</a></cite>, 125 S.W. 283, 1910<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        As a new promise creates a new obligation, it could be restricted to the payment of any part of the original obligation, but when it is not so restricted an unconditional promise to pay the indebtedness includes the unpaid interest, which is an integral part of the note and is carried with it unless segregated by agreement, just as such interest would be recovered in a suit on a note barred by the statute in the absence of a plea of that character. West v. W. T. B. Williams &amp; Sons, 202<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc382" target="_blank">Ky. 382</a></cite>, 259 S.W. 1015, 1924<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Evidence of an acknowledgment of, or promise to pay, an ordinary debt, if sufficient to suspend the statute of limitations, is sufficient to constitute an estoppel “in actions in tort or upon specialties” which are required to be brought within a certain time. Louisa v. Horton, 263<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 739</cite>, 93 S.W.2d 620, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 802</cite> (Ky. 1935).

        Promise to pay suspending running of statute of limitations must be proven to have been made within statutory time. Louisa v. Horton, 263<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 739</cite>, 93 S.W.2d 620, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 802</cite> (Ky. 1935).

        The law implies a promise to pay from an express acknowledgment of the debt. Muenninghoff v. Friedlander, 294<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 664</cite>, 172 S.W.2d 457, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 511</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff seeks to recover on ground that new promise tolled statute, the alleged new promise must form the basis of the action to the exclusion of the original promise. Muenninghoff v. Friedlander, 294<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 664</cite>, 172 S.W.2d 457, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 511</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        An acknowledgment of a debt to lift the bar limitation must be distinct, unqualified, unconditional recognition of an obligation for which the person making the admission is liable. Vinson's Ex'xs v. Maynard, 296<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 759</cite>, 178 S.W.2d 603, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 637</cite> (Ky. 1944).

       <p>
        In order to establish a waiver of notice of dishonor after discharge, the circumstances or conversations relied on must be unequivocal and import a clear admission of liability or amount to a distinct promise to pay; waiver will not be inferred from doubtful language. Vinson's Ex'xs v. Maynard, 296<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 759</cite>, 178 S.W.2d 603, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 637</cite> (Ky. 1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        One under a moral, as well as a legal, obligation to pay a note becomes liable upon a new promise to pay made after the bar of limitation has become complete, the new promise creating a new obligation. Vinson's Ex'xs v. Maynard, 296<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 759</cite>, 178 S.W.2d 603, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 637</cite> (Ky. 1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        The acknowledgment from which the law is to raise a promise, contrary to the provisions of the statute, must be clear and express, where the mind is brought directly to the point — debt or no debt at the present time — not whether the debt was once an existing demand. Vinson's Ex'xs v. Maynard, 296<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 759</cite>, 178 S.W.2d 603, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 637</cite> (Ky. 1944).

        In action against administrator and heirs seeking recovery on notes based on new promise to pay after expiration of 15 years from due date and attempting to have real estate that passed to administrator and heirs sold to satisfy claim, the issue of new promise to pay was a legal one, so that doctrine of laches could not be applied and the matter must be determined by the statute of limitations, notwithstanding that the action was one of which a court of equity had jurisdiction by reason of the legal issue being joined with another issue of exclusive equitable jurisdiction. Gover's Adm'r v. Dunagan, 299<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.05.html#tVc38" target="_blank">Ky. 38</a></cite>, 184 S.W.2d 225, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        A new promise to pay a debt barred by limitation creates a new obligation and the action must be brought on the new promise. Hutsell v. Current's Adm'r, 308<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 787</cite>, 215 S.W.2d 978, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1053</cite> (Ky. 1948).

        An express acknowledgement of a debt once barred by limitation, when proved by clear and convincing evidence, raises an implied promise to pay the debt. Hutsell v.

        Although acknowledgment was written in ex parte petition, it was not a “written contract” within the meaning of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.090" target="_self">413.090</a></cite>, but the 15 year statute of limitations, but it was simply a new promise based upon the original oral contract which was controlled by this section, the five (5) year statute of limitations. Mellema's Adm'r v. Whipple, 312<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc13" target="_blank">Ky. 13</a></cite>, 226 S.W.2d 318, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Since reply to cross complaint showed that more than five (5) years and even more than ten (10) years had elapsed between the date of acknowledgment in previous ex parte petition on April 24, 1934, and the date creditors filed their answer and cross petition on October 18, 1948, the debt was barred even under the new promise raised by the acknowledgment in the previous ex parte action.

        While statement in previous ex parte suit was an acknowledgment by deceased that she owed the debt, it was not made to her creditor or her creditor’s agent or representative so as to remove the bar of limitations but was simply a statement made to the court by decedent that she owed that debt along with others, in order that she might obtain a certain fund in the hand of her trustee to pay same and the fact that creditor’s mother joined in suit to waive any remainder or contingent interest she might have to the money sought to be withdrawn did not establish a privity between the parties with respect to the new promise.

       <p>
        In cases involving gratuitous bailments, there is a rule that unless delay in making a demand for return of the property is expressly contemplated by the parties, under some circumstances the court will presume from the lapse of an unreasonable time that such a demand was made and refused, and this is especially true where the relation of the parties is such as to render it improbable that demand should be neglected. Slack v. Bryan, 299<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132" target="_blank">Ky. 132</a></cite>, 184 S.W.2d 873, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 381</cite> (Ky. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        The contract of bailment is construed as importing a reasonable time for the return of the chattel, and the court will determine what is a reasonable time from the circumstances of each case; ordinarily the time in which demand will be deemed to have been made is that stipulated in the statute of limitations as barring the cause of action if not brought after it accrued. Slack v. Bryan, 299<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132" target="_blank">Ky. 132</a></cite>, 184 S.W.2d 873, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 381</cite> (Ky. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where bailee has permissive possession of a chattel without limit of time, the statute of limitations does not run against bailor’s right to bring an action to recover the chattel so long as the bailment lasts and where there is no limit of time or definite time fixed for the return, or termination is to be at the will of the bailor, there must be a demand made for the return and a refusal or some other act on the part of the bailee of which the bailor has notice which is hostile or inconsistent with the bailment and such as would constitute a denial of bailment or conversion of the chattel; it is then that there is a breach of the express or implied terms of the contract and then that the bailor’s cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations accrues. Slack v. Bryan, 299<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132" target="_blank">Ky. 132</a></cite>, 184 S.W.2d 873, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 381</cite> (Ky. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where bailees in gratuitous bailment were father and mother of bailor, there would be no presumption of a demand for return of the property and a refusal, even though the bailment continued for 25 years.

        Where defendant filed a motion to dismiss action by successor trustee of estate of bankrupt to recover a money judgment on the ground that the claim was barred by the five (5) year statute of limitations embodied in this section, the court reserved the question of limitation in overruling motion to dismiss since it could better be considered when concisely pled by a responsive pleading.

        A defendant has a right to waive the statute of limitations if he desires to do so, and if he would avail himself of a lapse of time as a peremptory bar to the maintenance of a cause of action against him, he must interpose the statute by a plea to that effect.

        It is unnecessary for the plaintiff in an action for wrongful cutting and appropriation of timber by grantee of an estate for the life of grantor, to allege in the petition when the cause of action accrued, or to state such facts as will show it is not barred by the statute of limitations; but the statute of limitations, if relied on as ground of defense, must be pleaded by the party seeking its protection.

        The plea of limitation is a personal one, and a party entitled to plead it may, by his acts, conduct, and statements, estop himself to rely upon it as a defense “in actions in tort, or upon specialties,” which are required to be brought within a certain time.

        Plea of limitations under this section was not available where trial court followed explicit directions of Court of Appeals in relation to any valid claims which might be presented by the widow in an action by heirs to make settlement of estate, thus closing the door to the plea of limitations particularly when the widow’s amended pleading was timely filed.

       <p>
        A plea of limitations is an affirmative defense, especially where the case involves a continuing trust. However, the defendant need only invoke the statute, without pleading or proving any facts, if the case is one where all of the facts, or sufficient facts, are set forth in the plaintiff’s petition.

        In an action to recover on a promissory note where plaintiff’s claim on note and defendant’s defense of payment both originated in items of open account between the parties, and grew out of mutuality of interrelated business dealings between the parties, it was error for court to direct verdict for plaintiff on ground that defense of payment was barred by limitations.

       <p>
        The benefit of the statute of limitations cannot be obtained by a demurrer to a cause of action set out in an amended petition showing that the cause of action accrued more than one (1) year prior to the filing of the amendment but not showing that the petitioner did not come within one of the exceptions contained in the statute which would avoid the bar of the statute. Low v. Ramsey, 135<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc333" target="_blank">Ky. 333</a></cite>, 122 S.W. 167, 1909<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 292</cite> (Ky. 1909).

        The statute must be pleaded and cannot be raised by demurrer. Smith v.

        In order for the statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer, the petition must show not only the lapse of time but also the nonexistence of any ground of avoidance or of circumstances which may have prevented the statute from running. Webster County v. Hall, 275<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 54</cite>, 120 S.W.2d 756, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 367</cite> (Ky. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule is that the plea of limitations to be available must be by a pleading and ordinarily cannot be raised by demurrer. Finch's Ex'r v. Hopewell, 285<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 495</cite>, 148 S.W.2d 345, 1941<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 414</cite> (Ky. 1941).

       <p>
        The defense of limitations cannot as a general rule be raised by demurrer but must be pleaded. Crady v. Hubrich, 299<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 461</cite>, 185 S.W.2d 949, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 446</cite> (Ky. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defense based upon the statute of limitations is one that ordinarily must be pleaded rather than set up in a motion or demurrer. Woolery v. Smith, 302<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 725</cite>, 196 S.W.2d 115, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 741</cite> (Ky. 1946).

        In action on note, counterclaim for use and occupation of room which plaintiff had rented from defendant which alleged that plaintiff made frequent promises to pay rent, that at no time during occupancy had as much as five (5) years elapsed between making of promises, and that plaintiff had promised to pay rent within five (5) years next before filing of answer was not demurrable on ground that claim was barred by limitation. Markwell v. Kahlkoff, 258<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.19.html#tXIXc231" target="_blank">Ky. 231</a></cite>, 79 S.W.2d 984, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        The plea of the statute of limitations does not constitute a valid counterclaim, for it is a shield and not a sword, and is ground for the cancellation of an instrument that is barred by the statute of limitations purely and simply as a matter of defense not affecting the validity of a note in any way. Rader v. Dean, 275<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.21.html#tXXIc255" target="_blank">Ky. 255</a></cite>, 121 S.W.2d 43, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 406</cite> (Ky. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        A demand for damages based upon a tort, when pleaded by way of counterclaim, is regarded as an affirmative action and is amenable to the operation of the statute of limitations and is unavailable if barred by it.

        Where business dealings of the parties after the execution of note continued with unchanged character and defendant relied upon plaintiff, being a banker, to allow proper credits on what was treated as a running account and plaintiff’s own books showed that after the note was executed he continued to keep credit and debit items just as he had prior to that time, defendant could set off claims outlawed by the statute of limitations against action on note.

        Where there is a factual issue upon which the application of the limitation provided by this section depends, it is proper to submit the question to the jury and that can best be done by requiring the jury to render a special verdict under CR 49.01.

        In a dispute between plaintiffs (four sisters) and defendants (their brothers, who were fiduciaries of their parents' estates), because the record was replete with material factual disputes about whether defendants made adequate and truthful disclosures to plaintiffs regarding the parents' estate plans, settlement of a lawsuit, and disputed transfers of stock and real property, and accepting plaintiffs' testimony as to their actual discovery of the fiduciary breaches and fraud alleged, the court could not say as a matter of law that the claims were time barred under Kentucky law.

        A judgment dismissing an action on ground that plaintiff’s claim is barred by the statute of limitations is a decision on the merits and is res judicata. Burlew v.

        A reparation obligor can properly join as a party in the tort suit prior to judgment, provided the intervention occurs within five (5) years, but it is the person suffering the injury who must commence the action.

        For an employee’s action against his employer under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for suspension of his disability retirement benefits, the most analogous statute of limitations in this Commonwealth was the five-year period found in either subdivision (5) of this section for an action for damages for withholding personal property or subdivision (6) of this section for an action for detaining personal property.

        Where a former employee alleged that defendants caused the employee to be prosecuted for crimes of which the employee was innocent and sought to cause the employee's termination, dismissal of the employee's invasion of privacy claim would be premature because the court was not convinced that the events giving rise to the action necessarily occurred over a year before the employee filed the complaint.

       An occupational license ordinance is a liability created by statute and hence the five-year statute of limitations applies with the statute beginning to run at the time the fee is due.<cite class="OAG">OAG 71-135</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The five-year statute of limitations would apply where the county asserted a claim for repayment of unauthorized deductions from excess fees taken by county officials.<cite class="OAG">OAG 78-233</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section would apply to limit the number of years for which tax refunds could be sought where part of a fire district was annexed by a city and property owners in the annexed area had been paying both the city and the district for fire protection services.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-121</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where
    two (2) successive circuit clerks performed the duties of county law librarian without compensation, the fiscal court might be required by a court to make up those payments, under the salary established pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.14.html#tXIVc172s172.110ol11" target="_blank">172.110(1)</a></cite>, but within the five-year statute of limitation, pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-177</cite>.

      <p>
       The state auditor, in what might be termed a “current audit,” may disallow credit against the fees of a county clerk’s office in prior years for improper expenditures not cited in prior year audits by a private accountant. However, a legal action filed by a fiscal court to attempt to recover monies said to have been unlawfully expended, will be governed by this section.<cite class="OAG">OAG 94-15</cite>

        Insurer’s auto property damage subrogation action against the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident with an insured was untimely as it was filed more than two (2) years after the date of the underlying accident; the two-year statute of limitations found in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.125" target="_self">413.125</a></cite> applied to the action because that was the statute of limitations that would have applied to the insured if she had filed an action directly against the driver.

        The statutes of limitation do not apply to anyone not in possession of property but is a defense toward maintaining the status quo so that a mere claim for whatever time, unaccompanied by actual possession, can give no right under the statute to one out of possession under a fraudulent conveyance or void conveyance which would ripen into a perfect one by time and sustain an action in ejectment against one originally having the better title and in possession.

        A cause of action to recover overpayment of purchase money was based upon an implied contract to refund the money paid as a result of mutual mistake in acreage and not on the deed; thus, the statute of limitations did not run from the date of the deed but from the date of overpayment. Nave v. Price, 108<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc105" target="_blank">Ky. 105</a></cite>, 55 S.W. 882, 21<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        Although a mistake in acreage was discovered within a year prior to institution of action, purchaser did not use due diligence to ascertain the quantity of land the boundary contained where it was in an irregular shape and he failed to have a survey made at an earlier date; therefore, the action brought almost ten (10) years after the last payment of the purchase price was barred by the statute of limitations.

        Purchaser was not entitled to a judgment on its counterclaim arising from an implied promise on the part of payee to refund money paid by mistake in acreage where the payment was made and the mistake discovered more than five (5) years before the claim was asserted since the plea of limitation as to the claim was good.

        The correct rule for applying the statute of limitations in purchaser’s action for shortage in acreage through a mistake in the deed seems to be that the statute shall run from the discovery of the mistake, or from such time as, by the exercise of ordinary diligence, it ought to have been discovered by the plaintiff and failure to solve the doubt as to the quantity of the tract by having it surveyed is not the exercise of ordinary diligence; thus, an action brought more than five (5) years after payment for the land is barred by the statute of limitations.

        A pleading declaring that more than ten (10) years had elapsed since the alleged fraud was insufficient to afford ground for relief, and it was proper to so declare on demurrer. Gowdy v. Johnson, 104<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 648</cite>, 47 S.W. 624, 20<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 997</cite>, 1898<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        The ten (10) year statute of limitations cannot be taken advantage of by demurrer to petition to recover damages for deceit. Schneider v. Schleutker, 64 S.W. 505, 23<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 951</cite>, 1901<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 476</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where pleadings in action to correct mistake in deed showed the action was commenced 18 years after the mistake was made, the action was barred by the ten (10) year statute of limitations and it was proper for the court to sustain a demurrer to the pleadings. Green's Adm'r v. Irvine, 66 S.W. 278, 23<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1762</cite> (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no reason why a plaintiff in an action for reformation of a deed should be required to anticipate in his petition a plea of the statute of limitations and allege matter in avoidance of it but, when pleaded, he may set forth matter in avoidance of the plea. Swinebroad v. Wood, 123<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 664</cite>, 97 S.W. 25, 29<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1202</cite>, 1906<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 198</cite> (Ky. 1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute of limitations must be pleaded and cannot be reached by a demurrer to a pleading seeking reformation of a deed for mistake of the draftsman. Swinebroad v. Wood, 123<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 664</cite>, 97 S.W. 25, 29<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1202</cite>, 1906<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 198</cite> (Ky. 1906).

        If the defendant pleads limitation in an action to surcharge a tax collector’s settlement and the plaintiff does not by his reply show facts sufficient to avoid the plea of the statute, the court may sustain a demurrer to the reply. Green County v. Howard, 127<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.31.html#tXXXIc379" target="_blank">Ky. 379</a></cite>, 105 S.W. 897, 32<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendants pleaded fraud in defense to a suit, they were not bound, because it appeared that the fraud occurred more than ten (10) years before suit was brought, to anticipate the plea of limitations and allege facts in the answer in avoidance. Baker v. Begley, 155<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.19.html#tXIXc234" target="_blank">Ky. 234</a></cite>, 159 S.W. 691, 1913<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 216</cite> (Ky. 1913).

        In action for reformation of deed, complaint was not defective for failure to negative the running of the statute of limitations. Kirk v. Kirk's Ex'r, 167<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc69" target="_blank">Ky. 69</a></cite>, 179 S.W. 1065, 1915<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 796</cite> (Ky. 1915).

       <p>
        Limitations against suit to set aside deed for fraud must be pleaded and cannot be relied on by demurrer. Stair v. Gilbert, 209<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.20.html#tXXc243" target="_blank">Ky. 243</a></cite>, 272 S.W. 732, 1925<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 472</cite> (Ky. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although limitations generally must be pleaded and may not be raised by demurrer, the rule respecting an action for relief from fraud brought more than five (5) years after the fraud was perpetrated is that the plaintiff must allege facts to excuse the delay or he fails to state a cause of action. Forman v. Gault, 236<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc213" target="_blank">Ky. 213</a></cite>, 32 S.W.2d 977, 1930<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 712</cite> (Ky. 1930).

        In the absence of allegation of facts excusing delay, the action of creditors against a husband who by the use of his own money caused substantial improvements to be erected on his wife’s property, brought more than five (5) years after the erection of the improvements, was barred by the statutes of limitation. Pierce v. J. B. Pierce's Trustee in Bankruptcy, 238<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 495</cite>, 38 S.W.2d 254, 1931<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 267</cite> (Ky. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of limitation in an action for relief on the ground of fraud or mistake may be raised by demurrer where the petition contains no allegation excusing the delay in filing action. Mullins v. Jennings' Guardian, 273<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68" target="_blank">Ky. 68</a></cite>, 115 S.W.2d 340, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        An action for relief from fraud brought more than five (5) years after the fraud was perpetrated is an exception to the general rule that the defense of limitations cannot be raised by demurrer, since the plaintiff in such an action must allege facts to excuse the delay. Crady v. Hubrich, 299<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 461</cite>, 185 S.W.2d 949, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 446</cite> (Ky. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to recover damages in an action brought later than five (5) years after the alleged perpetration of fraud there must be an allegation and proof that the fraud was not discovered within the five-year period allowed under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120" target="_self">413.120</a></cite> and that by the exercise of ordinary care could not have been discovered within that time. Boone v. Gonzalez, 550 S.W.2d 571, 1977<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 685</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a confidential relationship exists between the parties, the statute of limitations for fraud does not begin to run until actual discovery of the fraud, there being no duty on the part of the injured party to exercise due diligence to discover the fraud; however, the party seeking to prosecute an action after the expiration of the general statutory time limit is not wholly relieved of the burden of pleading and proving that the tardiness is excusable. Boone v. Gonzalez, 550 S.W.2d 571, 1977<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 685</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action brought by grantor attacking validity of deed on ground of fraud, mistake and undue influence was barred by five-year statute of limitations, in absence of allegation that confidential relationship existed between grantor and grantees, and in absence of allegation that alleged fraud was not discovered and could not have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence within the five-year period. Skaggs v. Vaughn, 550 S.W.2d 574, 1977<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 686</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).

        All claims arising out of transactions for purchase of working interests in oil and gas leases on grounds they were induced by representations which were fraudulent were barred by the Kentucky five (5) year statute of limitations where plaintiffs failed to disclose by proof any facts or circumstances which precluded them from discovering the alleged fraud by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the lapse of the five (5) year period of limitations. Terrill v. Carpenter, 143 F. Supp. 747, 1956 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3028 (D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1956</cite>), aff'd, 249 F.2d 142, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 3942 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1957</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was unnecessary for defendant to aver, in pleading statute of limitations to an action for relief on ground of mistake, that the plaintiff had not used due diligence to discover the mistake sooner than was done in view of the allegations of the petition that the failure to discover the mistake was not the result of the lack of diligence. Nave v. Price, 108<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc105" target="_blank">Ky. 105</a></cite>, 55 S.W. 882, 21<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff is not required to anticipate the plea of statute of limitations and he need not aver that the fraud was discovered within five (5) years next before the bringing of the action and that he could not have discovered it sooner by the use of reasonable diligence. Coldiron v. Combs, 60 S.W. 386, 22<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1187</cite> (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the action is brought after five (5) years from the making of the mistake or the perpetration of the fraud, the plaintiff must allege and prove that he discovered it within five (5) years before the bringing of the suit, and must allege and prove facts showing that he could not by reasonable diligence have discovered it sooner. German Sec. Bank v. Columbia Finance &amp; Trust Co., 85 S.W. 761, 27<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 581</cite> (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        The sufficiency of the answer and counterclaim was not affected by defendant’s failure to state when he discovered the mistake, since the questions of limitation and laches were not raised by the demurrer. Stark v. Suttle, 181<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 646</cite>, 205 S.W. 673, 1918<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 578</cite> (Ky. 1918).

        In an action brought by executors of purchaser, more than five (5) years after mistake in deed as to the acreage, to recover the amount paid vendor in excess of the total purchase price per acre, evidence that executors resurveyed land and discovered mistake within preceding five (5) years showed when the executors found the deficiency in acreage, whether for the first time or not, but did not prove that their decedent, the purchaser, did not know of the mistake all the time and their action was barred by the ten (10) year statute of limitations. Gragg v. Levi, 183<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.15.html#tXVc182" target="_blank">Ky. 182</a></cite>, 208 S.W. 813, 1919<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 456</cite> (Ky. 1919).

       <p>
        The burden of proof was upon plaintiffs in an action to recover amount paid vendor in excess of the total purchase price per acre for a shortage in acreage and the five (5) year period having elapsed, it was incumbent upon them to establish by evidence that the mistake was not discovered and could not have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence until within five (5) years before the action was commenced. Gragg v. Levi, 183<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.15.html#tXVc182" target="_blank">Ky. 182</a></cite>, 208 S.W. 813, 1919<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 456</cite> (Ky. 1919).

        In action for fraud, defendants’ plea of limitations must prevail unless it is avoided by a reply showing that the action was brought within five (5) years after plaintiffs discovered the fraud, and that they could not by reasonable diligence have discovered it sooner. Mounts v. Charles, 187<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc421" target="_blank">Ky. 421</a></cite>, 219 S.W. 184, 1920<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 138</cite> (Ky. 1920).

       <p>
        In an action to avoid agreed division of land and deed of partition on the ground of fraud, where defendant traversed the allegations of fraud and pleaded in bar of action thereon the five (5) year statute of limitations, and plaintiff in avoidance of the plea of limitations alleged that she did not discover and could not have discovered the fraud until within five (5) years next before the filing of the action, plaintiff was required to prove that same could not have been discovered within five (5) years. Dyer v. Higgins, 202<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc66" target="_blank">Ky. 66</a></cite>, 258 S.W. 955, 1924<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 668</cite> (Ky. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition alleging that cause of action did not accrue within the five (5) year limitation of the statute because plaintiff did not discover the fraud until within 12 months of bringing suit and defendant’s denial of that matter of avoidance raised the issue without additional pleading but plaintiff did, in his reply, deny that his cause of action “as set up in the petition” was barred by the statute of limitations. Klineline v. Head, 205<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 644</cite>, 266 S.W. 370, 1924<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 205</cite> (Ky. 1924).

        To sustain an action for relief against alleged fraud or mistake, brought after the expiration of five (5) years from the commission thereof and within ten (10) years from that time, so as to be within the provisions of this section, the petition must allege, and the proof must show, that the plaintiff did not, and could not by reasonable diligence, discover the fraud or mistake until within five (5) years before the commencement of the action. Elkhorn Coal Corp. v. Hite, 225<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 735</cite>, 9 S.W.2d 1083, 1928<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 862</cite> (Ky. 1928).

       <p>
        Where, independently of any constructive notice of the fraud, plaintiff failed to prove his inability to discover the alleged fraud upon which he relied within the five (5) year period for the bringing of his action, his action for fraudulent representation that land in possession of a third party was included in the deed was barred by the statutes of limitation. Jennings v. Fain, 226<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc290" target="_blank">Ky. 290</a></cite>, 10 S.W.2d 1101, 1928<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 94</cite> (Ky. 1928).

        Cause of action for damages for malpractice accrues when a party has a right and capacity to sue and, even if the running of the one year statute of limitations could be suspended under this section by fraud, the intent being controlling, fraudulent concealment is necessarily based on knowledge and not on what may be discovered by the exercise of ordinary care, and the allegation that the defendants knew, or by the exercise of ordinary care should have known, that forceps were left in abdomen was not sufficient to show fraudulent concealment. Carter v. Harlan Hospital Ass'n, 265<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.42.html#tXXXXIIc452" target="_blank">Ky. 452</a></cite>, 97 S.W.2d 9, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        An action to construe a newly found will and thus set aside the agreed settlement of an estate some ten (10) years after the death of the decedent and nine (9) years after the settlement must fail where plaintiff’s proof fails completely to show that the discovery of the will was not made within five (5) years before the commencement of the action. Dycus v. Dycus, 295<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 847</cite>, 175 S.W.2d 997, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 353</cite> (Ky. 1943).

        A person seeking to avoid the five (5) year statute on ground of fraud or mistake must allege and prove not only that the fraud or mistake was not discovered within the five (5) year period but that it could not have been discovered sooner by reasonable diligence and in no event can an action be maintained after the lapse of ten (10) years from the perpetration of the fraud. Redding v. Main, 303<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc41" target="_blank">Ky. 41</a></cite>, 196 S.W.2d 887, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 787</cite> (Ky. 1946).

       <p>
        Since the only apparent basis for this section is that a special class, builders, architects and engineers involved in construction, faced with a growing exposure to litigation, lobbied for a statute limiting their liability, and there is no social or economic basis presented to justify a special class, and other groups similarly situated do not share in their legislative windfall, this section is in fundamental conflict with the fifth clause of Ky. Const., § 59 and its historical development. Tabler v. Wallace, 704 S.W.2d 179, 1985<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 291</cite> (Ky. 1985), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 822, 107 S. Ct. 89, 93 L.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the plaintiff did not give the trial court the opportunity to gauge the constitutionality of this section in the light of Ky. Const., § 59, she waived her right to depend on Ky. Const., § 59 protection when it was raised for the first time on appeal. Massie v. Persson, 729 S.W.2d 448, 1987<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 444</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1987), overruled,

       <p>
        The 1986 version of this section is still constitutionally defective as special legislation and further attempts to amend it to overcome the constitutional defects fatally impale upon Ky.

        The purpose of this section was to protect a builder from liability for accidents occurring after the specified time and not to extend the right of an individual to sue. Lee v. Fister, 413 F.2d 1286, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 11286 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1969</cite>).

        This section is called a “statute of limitations” but its purpose is not to limit the time in which to bring causes of action which have accrued but to extinguish causes of action which have not yet accrued, and, whereas the title to this section is generalized, the contents of this section refer to a narrowly defined and exclusively protected class. Tabler v. Wallace, 704 S.W.2d 179, 1985<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 291</cite> (Ky. 1985), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 822, 107 S. Ct. 89, 93 L. Ed. 2d 41, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 3436 (U.S. 1986).

        This section enlarges the scope of the five (5) year limitation on actions against a builder of a home to include actions for injury to real or personal property; it also provides for the same five (5) year limitation on actions for personal injury against a builder of a home as was provided for in subsection (14) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120" target="_self">413.120</a></cite>. Lee v. Fister, 413 F.2d 1286, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 11286 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1969</cite>). (Decision prior to 1988 amendment of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120" target="_self">413.120</a></cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        All actions for personal injury are subject to the limitations contained in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140" target="_self">413.140</a></cite> and must be brought within one (1) year from the date of injury, but when the cause of action is against a builder of a home or other improvement, this section imposes the added limitation that the action cannot be brought at all more than five (5) years after completion of the home or other improvement, or, when the injury occurs in the fifth year, the action cannot be brought more than six years following completion of the home.

       <p>
        The application of this section to bar an action for damages for injuries and death allegedly caused by the building contractor’s negligent construction of a fireplace was constitutionally impermissible in that its application destroyed the common-law right to bring an action for negligence that proximately caused personal injury or death and violated the spirit and language of Ky. Const., §§ 14, 54, and 241. Saylor v. Hall, 497 S.W.2d 218, 1973<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 304</cite> (Ky. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although this section was enacted in 1966, and at that time the law of this state did not provide a cause of action, which was later developed, by the vendee of real estate against the vendor on the basis of an implied warranty, there was no constitutional impediment to the application of this section to damage sustained by vendee due to alleged breach of such warranty. Ball Homes, Inc. v. Volpert, 633 S.W.2d 63, 1982<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 247</cite> (Ky. 1982).

        This section applies only to constructions of real estate; it does not apply to manufacturers of personal property. In re Beverly Hills Fire Litigation, 695 F.2d 207, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 17268 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1982</cite>), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 929, 103 S. Ct. 2090, 77 L. Ed. 2d 300, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 4603 (U.S. 1983).
       </p>

        This section is not applicable in an action against manufacturers of products used in the design or construction of a permanent improvement to real estate; if this section did include such manufacturers within its protected class, it would be unconstitutional as special legislation in violation of Ky. Const., § 59. In re Beverly Hills Fire Litigation, 672 S.W.2d 922, 1984<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 239</cite> (Ky. 1984).

       <p>
        Where the Kentucky courts had never considered whether “materialmen” who designed products for construction projects were within the contemplation of subsection (1) of this section, the federal Court of Appeals had to make a considered “educated guess” as to how Kentucky courts would view this section, and since there was no evidence in the language of this section indicating an intent to exclude materialmen from protection of the section, the “educated guess” of the Court of Appeals was that there was no reason to preclude materialmen from asserting the statute of limitations of this section as a defense. In re Beverly Hills Fire Litigation, 695 F.2d 207, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 17268 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1982</cite>), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 929, 103 S. Ct. 2090, 77 L.

        In an action against materialmen who designed and furnished aluminum circuit wiring in 1970 that allegedly caused a supper club fire in 1977, Ky. Const., §§ 14, 51 and 241 precluded application of the five-year statute of limitations of this section to bar suit against the defendants, as it would have extinguished a common law right of action before the injury occurred and before the plaintiffs had any reasonable opportunity to seek redress in court. In re Beverly Hills Fire Litigation, 695 F.2d 207, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 17268 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1982</cite>), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 929, 103 S. Ct. 2090, 77 L.

        The rule that a cause of action does not accrue under a statute of limitations until the discovery of the injury does not apply to this section which establishes the date of substantial completion as the point at which the limitations period begins to run. Housing Now-Village West, Inc. v. Cox &amp; Crawley, Inc., 646 S.W.2d 350, 1982<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 283</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where building owners signed contract document establishing a date of substantial completion of buildings, such date started the running of the statute of limitations and action for damages resulting from defects in construction was barred when brought more than five (5) years after the date established. Housing Now-Village West, Inc. v. Cox &amp; Crawley, Inc., 646 S.W.2d 350, 1982<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 283</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff developed cancer after living for 12 years in a house treated with a toxic chemical, the statute of limitations commenced from the date the plaintiff knew or should have discovered not only that she had been injured but also that her injury may have been caused by the defendant’s product.

        An action for tort, when barred by the statute of limitations, cannot, like a case founded upon contract, be revived by a new promise or acknowledgment. Luther &amp; Morgan v. Payne, 197<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc359" target="_blank">Ky. 359</a></cite>, 247 S.W. 39, 1923<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 645</cite> (Ky. 1923).

       <p>
        This section limits the time in which an action for damages “for injuries to the person” may be brought to within one (1) year next after the cause of action accrued and is applicable alike, whether considered as an action based upon contract or one in tort, and applies in preference to the general contract statute, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120" target="_self">413.120</a></cite>, limiting to five (5) years the time for bringing actions ex contractu.

        Where a personal injury action arising from an accident which occurred on July 25, 1973, was filed on July 25, 1974, such action was timely under this section since the day of the accident must be excluded in computing the limitation period pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXXXXIc446s446.030" target="_blank">446.030</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides both a limitations period and a repose period; subdivision 1(e), read with the discovery rule contained in the first part of subsection 2, provides that an action must be brought against physicians, etc., within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, and that the cause of action accrues at the time the injury is first discovered, or with reasonable care should have been discovered. This is a statute of limitations, since it limits the time in which a plaintiff may bring suit after a cause of action accrues; the second part of subsection 2 provides that in no event shall a plaintiff commence an action more than five (5) years after the date on which the alleged negligent act was inflicted, and since it is possible that an injury and damages brought about by an allegedly negligent act may not be discovered within the five (5) years provided by this part of the statute, the cause of action would be destroyed before it legally existed; thus, this portion of the statute constitutes a statute of repose.

        This section applies to all actions for personal injury and they are to be brought within one (1) year from the date of the injury, but when the cause of action for personal injury is against a builder of a home or other improvement, there is the added limitation provided by subsection (14) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120" target="_self">413.120</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.135" target="_self">413.135</a></cite> that the action cannot be brought at all more than five (5) years after the completion of the home or other improvement (or six (6) years of the injury occurred in the fifth year following the completion of the home).

        A husband’s right of action to recover damages for the loss of services and consortium of his wife, who was injured while a passenger on a train, was an action for personal injuries barred one (1) year after the date of the injury under the one (1) year statute of limitations and not an action growing out of a contract of carriage to which the five (5) year statute of limitations would apply. Cravens v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., 188<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 579</cite>, 222 S.W. 930, 1920<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 326</cite> (Ky. 1920).

        This section is applicable to an action against a hospital for injuries to person due to unskillful and negligent operation of the hospital. Howard v. Middlesborough Hospital, 242<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 602</cite>, 47 S.W.2d 77, 1932<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 335</cite> (Ky. 1932).

        An action against the parent of a minor, under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.16.html#tXVIc186s186.590" target="_blank">186.590</a></cite>, for personal injuries arising from negligent operation of an automobile by the minor, is an action for personal injuries governed by the one (1) year period of limitations fixed by paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section, and not an action upon a liability created by statute for which a five (5) year period of limitations is fixed by subsection (2) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120" target="_self">413.120</a></cite>. The fact that a judgment has been obtained against the minor and that the judgment may be conclusive against the parent on the questions of negligence and damages makes no difference. Robinson v. Hardaway, 293<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 627</cite>, 169 S.W.2d 823, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 675</cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a suit is brought in the name of the state, a defense of limitations may be made when its name is used to enforce a right which inures to the benefit of an individual or corporation and the state has no real interest in the litigation. The converse of this is true also, and when a suit is for the sole benefit of the state although not brought in its name, the defense of the statute of limitations cannot be made; therefore, a suit brought against the department of welfare is barred by the statutes of limitation. Department of Welfare v. Fox, 240 S.W.2d 65, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 944</cite> (Ky. 1951).

        The one (1) year limitation is applicable to a parent’s action for loss of services and medical expenses arising out of an injury to his child. Blackburn v. Burchett, 335 S.W.2d 342, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 258</cite> (Ky. 1960).

       <p>
        Where the statute of limitations had run against the operator of the automobile involved in a collision, but the operator was not an essential party to the action, the defendant owner could not take advantage of the same statute of limitations, because, being a serviceman, the soldiers’ and sailors’ relief act was pre-emptive in nature and tolled the applicable Kentucky statute during the period of his military service. Ray v. Porter, 464 F.2d 452, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 8220 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1972</cite>).

       <p>
        Since the Kentucky courts have never resolved the apparent conflict between KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc355s355.2-725" target="_blank">355.2-725</a></cite> and subdivision (1)(a) of this section over which limitation statute applies in a breach of warranty action for personal injuries, a federal court applied the four-year limitations period of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc355s355.2-725" target="_blank">355.2-725</a></cite>, because when substantial doubt exists as to which of two (2) limitations statutes is applicable, the longer period will be applied. Teel v. American Steel Foundries, 529 F. Supp. 337, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16835 (E.D. Mo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The one-year limitations period of subdivision (1)(a) of this section should be applied to product liability claims; therefore, where a personal injury action was not commenced until almost three (3) years from the date of the accident, the court properly dismissed the products liability count of plaintiff’s complaint. Teel v. American Steel Foundries, 529 F. Supp. 337, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16835 (E.D. Mo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since plaintiff was member of armed forces at time of accident and at time of the filing of the complaint, running of the statute of limitations of Kentucky was tolled by Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act. Kilfoile v. Sherman, 535 S.W.2d 69, 1975<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 5</cite> (Ky. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an essential element of each cause of action pled by plaintiff was the publication of an utterly false derogatory report about the plaintiff by defendant, the gist of the entire action was libel, and the one-year statute of limitations was properly applied to all counts no matter how labeled. Lashlee v. Sumner, 570 F.2d 107, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 12711 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1978</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where personal injury case based on accident occurring in Ohio was transferred by Ohio federal district court to federal district court in Kentucky upon finding that court in Ohio lacked personal jurisdiction over defendant, Kentucky’s one-year statute of limitations was applicable. T-Birds, Inc. v. Thoroughbred Helicopter Service, Inc., 540 F. Supp. 548, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14161 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1982</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case arising out of the plaintiff’s operation of a motor vehicle where the defendant was a nonmotorist, the statute of limitations was two (2) years as provided in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc304s304.39-230" target="_blank">304.39-230</a></cite>(6) rather than the one (1) year as provided in this section. Bailey v. Reeves, 662 S.W.2d 832, 1984<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 202</cite> (Ky. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (1)(a) of this section is the general provision which applies to all personal injury actions with certain specific exceptions, and as such, is the statute which the Supreme Court in Owens v. Okure, 488 U.S. 235, 109 S. Ct. 573, 102 L. Ed. 2d 594, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 305 (1989), requires to be applied in Kentucky personal injury cases. Hambrick v. Davies, 711 F. Supp. 884, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10856 (E.D. Ky.), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 886 F.2d 1315, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 14982 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1989</cite>).

        While state law governs the substantive limitation period, federal law governs when the cause of action accrues, and thus when the statute begins to run. Leonard v. Corrections Cabinet, 828 S.W.2d 668, 1992<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 75</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).

        Action by owner of building fireproofed with material that contained asbestos against manufacturer of the fireproofing seeking relief on the theory of conspiracy after owner found that building had been contaminated with asbestos fibers, was barred by subsection (1)(c) of this section where Bank had information available to it in 1985 that its building contained asbestos. which had been found to have dangerous propensities and that defendant was its manufacturer, but did not file the action until 1991. Farm Credit Bank v. United States Mineral Prods. Co., 864 F. Supp. 643, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14642 (W.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1994</cite>).

        This section does not state that it applies to either the writ of habeas corpus or a petition for declaration of rights regarding good time credit; therefore, there was no reason for the court to apply it to the petition of the inmate.

        Drug manufacturer was entitled to summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 in a product liability action that arose from the use of OxyContin, a pain-relieving medicine, which allegedly caused plaintiffs’ drug addiction; plaintiffs were aware of their alleged addiction more than one (1) year before the filing of their complaint and, thus, the claims were barred by the statute of limitations under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140ol11a" target="_self">413.140(1)(a)</a></cite>.

        Inmate’s
    declaratory judgment action, despite alleging that his Fourteenth Amendment
    due process rights were violated, was actually premised on a state law personal

        One (1) year statute of limitations set forth in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140" target="_self">413.140</a></cite> was applicable to claims asserted in a District Court in Kentucky under 42 USCS § 1983, and the court had authority to dismiss the claims sua sponte when it was clear that they were barred by the one (1) year limitation period.

        Workers’
    compensation insurer’s rights, as subrogee to a workers’
    compensation claimant, were strictly derivative of any claims the claimant might pursue against the manufacturer of the all-terrain vehicle in which the claimant was injured on the job while riding as a passenger, and, as a result, the insurer’s subrogation action was subject to the same statute of limitations as a direct action by the claimant against the manufacturer. Because the insurer failed to file its subrogation claim against the manufacturer within one year of the claimant’s date of injury, a trial court correctly held that its claims were barred by the statute of limitations in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140" target="_self">413.140</a></cite>. Bridgefield Cas. Ins. Co. v. Yamaha Motor Mfg. Corp. of Am., 2012<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 176</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 21, 2012).

       <p>
        Subrogee who sued the alleged manufacturer after the subrogee paid workers’
    compensation benefits to the subrogor had only the same amount of time to sue the alleged manufacturer that the subrogor would have had if the subrogor had sued directly. Since the subrogee did not sue the alleged manufacturer within one year of the date of the relevant accident, its claim was time barred under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140" target="_self">413.140</a></cite> because the subrogor only would have had one year to sue under that statute.

        In a pro se former inmate’s 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 case in which three employees of a health services company moved for summary judgment, the former inmate’s § 1983 claims were time-barred under the one-year statute of limitations found in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140ol11a" target="_self">413.140(1)(a)</a></cite>. October 21, 2010, was the first date that the employees had or could possibly have had notice of the action, the former inmate’s contention that the case commenced on March 15, 2010 was contradicted by his own words in his response brief, and he could not credibly argue that the October 2010 complaint related back to the March 15, 2010 filing.

        Where plaintiff who was injured in an accident which occurred on May 20, 1975 before the effective date of Kentucky’s no-fault insurance law which established a two-year statute of limitations for torts arising from auto mishaps, did not file her complaint until September 14, 1976, time for filing complaint was not extended to the two-year limitation but was subject to one-year limitation of this section and was properly dismissed.

        The trial court erred in applying the two-year no-fault statute of limitations and should have applied the one-year statute of limitations mandated in this section in an action for injuries sustained by one who was “standing” on a flatbed trailer attempting to secure the tarpaulin when a bungee strap struck him in the eye. Simply because the injured person was standing on the trailer did not amount to his occupying, entering into or alighting from the motor vehicle within the contemplation of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc304s304.39-020" target="_blank">304.39-020</a></cite>(6).

        The trial court erred as a matter of law in applying Kentucky’s Motor Vehicle Reparations Act (MVRA) to the circumstances attendant to the operation of a golf cart on a public course, and the one-year personal injury statute of limitations was applicable and not the two-year statute of limitations under MVRA.

        The statute does not apply to an action for common law indemnity as such an action is not a claim in which the claimant seeks damages for his/her own personal injuries, but is one in which the claimant seeks restitution for damages he/she was required to pay for injuries sustained by another and which were entirely or primarily caused by the party against whom indemnity is sought.

        By amendment of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.170" target="_self">413.170</a></cite> to remove coverture as a disability, the Legislature disallowed infant married women the right to postpone an action by a claim of disability of infancy and the one (1) year statute of limitations barred a personal injury action brought by an infant married woman after the expiration of one (1) year from the date of the injury.

        Where an infant is represented by a nonresident as next friend, who was not qualified as such, upon obtaining majority he does not have to commence a new action, but can proceed on the existing action after dropping the next friend from the case, so that there is no statute of limitations question, if the original action was timely.

        A claim did not become time-barred when the plaintiff made no motion to substitute herself as the real party in interest within one (1) year after she reached the age of majority since she was always the real party in interest and her failure to promptly remove her next friend did not invalidate the proceeding.

        District court erred when it rejected the individual’s argument that the statute of limitations should have been tolled because she was of unsound mind because if the individual could have proved that she was immediately rendered mentally unsound by the blow to her head, which was the very injury that gave rise to the individual’s lawsuit, then the individual’s action would have been within the purview of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.170ol11" target="_self">413.170(1)</a></cite>, and the individual would have therefore complied with Kentucky’s one-year statute of limitations, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140ol11a" target="_self">413.140(1)(a)</a></cite>.

        The rule that the one (1) year statute of limitations begins to run on the date of the discovery of the injury, or on the date it should, in the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, have been discovered extends the beginning of the statute of limitations only until the time the harmful effects of the negligence first manifests itself.

        Where Kentucky resident, in good faith and in due time, sued a foreign corporation in state circuit court for personal injuries and action was dismissed because of court’s lack of jurisdiction of defendant, and plaintiff then instituted an action in the federal district court, defendant’s contention that the action was barred by this section was erroneous and his motion for a judgment on the pleadings properly was denied.

        Action against Kentucky resident by Virginia resident for personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident occurring in Kentucky was not barred by the Kentucky one (1) year statute of limitations, since plaintiffs had done everything possible to protect their rights where their attorney, prior to the expiration of the one (1) year statute, attempted to file their complaint, found the clerk’s office closed, contacted the deputy clerk at her home, took the complaints to her, paid the required fees and delivered the summonses with a request they be issued but summonses were not issued until after expiration of the one (1) year period.

        Although statutes of limitation are favored by the law, when no one will be made to suffer by reason of a few hours’ delay and a litigant has done all that is within his power to do to seek redress in a court of justice for an alleged wrong done to him, and there is a grave doubt in the mind of the court that the statute has run, in the interest of justice this doubt should be construed on the side of the litigant.

        Plaintiffs suing to recover for injuries sustained in an automobile accident were under no compunction to seek their remedies at an earlier time than they deemed necessary, and where they were given a year from the time the action accrued to assert their claims, the fact that they waited until the eleventh hour was no bar to their causes of action.

        Doctor and company were fraudulently joined in an action brought by consumers against pharmaceutical companies, the doctor, and the company for injuries caused by the taking of prescription diet medications because the claims against the doctor and company, who were non-diverse defendants, were time-barred pursuant to the one-year statute of limitations set forth in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140ol11e" target="_self">413.140(1)(e)</a></cite>; therefore, the pharmaceutical companies properly removed the action, and it would not be remanded. Contrary to the consumers’ contentions, the common defense rule was inapplicable because any determination that the claims against the doctor and company were time-barred would not relieve the pharmaceutical companies of liability on the same grounds, and a settlement agreement in multidistrict litigation from which the consumers had opted out did not prohibit the pharmaceutical companies from raising statute of limitations arguments for jurisdictional purposes.

        The federal district court applied the limitation statute of the foreign state and not that of Kentucky where under Kentucky law the foreign state statute of limitations applied if it was for a longer time because the federal court was bound by the construction presently placed on the Kentucky statute by state courts even if it was satisfied that the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, when called upon to construe the statute, would embrace the law of the forum which was the prevailing law in 47 other states.

        The right of plaintiffs, who were Virginia residents, to proceed in federal court in an action for personal injuries arising from an automobile accident in Kentucky against a resident of Kentucky was not based on a Kentucky statute but on a common-law right to recover in tort for negligence so, consequently, the Kentucky statute of limitations was not a part of the remedy made available to the plaintiffs for the alleged wrong.

        The plaintiffs alleged that stray voltage injured their dairy herd and essentially, this was a “trespass” to the dairy herd; so, even assuming that the dairy herd’s exposure to stray voltage was continuous, the plaintiffs’ recovery was limited to damages for the injuries inflicted on the dairy herd during the one-year period immediately preceding the commencement of the action on September 8, 1989.

        By the use of “negligence or malpractice” in this section, the legislature intended for “malpractice” to mean something other than “negligence” and hence the law governs all causes of action against physicians and surgeons, regardless of whether the claim be alleged in tort or in contract, for the purposes of limitation period.

        Although some of the arguments in favor of the loss of chance doctrine are appealing, permitting damages for the loss of the possibility of recovery from the medical condition, it represents a significant departure from the traditional meaning of causation in tort law. The decision to expand the definition of causation and thus the potential liability of the medical profession involves significant and far-reaching policy concerns more properly left to the Legislature.

Although the patient continued to have her prescriptions renewed by the doctor after that date, she did not allege that she was relying on him to correct the consequences of poor treatment. Litsey v.

        Supreme court declined to extend its continuous treatment doctrine to include situations when a patient continued to receive care at the same hospital but not by the same physician as there was no evidence that the patient was considered a patient of the medical group where all of the members participated in her treatment because the medical group treating the patient was composed of over 700 physicians with over 70 specialties; thus, that doctrine did not toll the statute of limitations for her claims against appellee doctors.

        Where a mortgagor pays his debt and accrues interest by making a conveyance of the fee-simple title of the property embraced in the mortgage to the mortgagee, and the latter surrenders the notes evidencing the debt, the mortgagor cannot maintain an action to recover usury so paid more than one (1) year after the transaction.

        A renewal note payable to another payee to avoid the usury laws did not stop the running of the one (1) year statute of limitations from the date of the last payment on the debt. Newdegate v.

        Vendor’s right to recover usury on mortgage notes accrued when the purchasers took them up and executed their individual note and a new mortgage in their place and was barred after one (1) year; therefore, in an action on the new note, the purchasers could not plead usury on the old notes as a defense even with joinder of the vendor.

        The mere assignment of a usurious obligation does not pay the usury nor set statute of limitations to running, because it is the same usurious obligation, and no transaction has occurred sufficient to make a novation which could be deemed a payment of the obligation and a discharge of it.

        In an action by a bank upon a claim, defendants could as a defense seek to purge the claim of the usury which they alleged was embraced in the claim since it is well settled that a debt may be purged of usury so long as any part of the principal of the debt remains unpaid.

        Since under CR 3 a civil action for personal injuries is commenced by the filing of a complaint and the issuance of a summons in good faith, if the complaint is filed prior to the expiration of the period of limitations but the summons is not issued until the period of limitations has expired, the action is barred.

        Where complaint was filed three (3) days before the statute of limitations period would run and, upon discovering fact that the defendant was under 21, plaintiff’s counsel tried to obtain service upon him by serving his father and by having a guardian ad litem appointed, which were unnecessary actions in view of recent amendment to the law, and defendant was finally personally served eight days after the limitation period had run, action was timely commenced, as plaintiff’s counsel acted in good faith.

        Where administrator was appointed and wrongful death commenced just before the expiration of the period of limitations, the fact that the judge did not sign the order book pages pertaining to the appointment until after the period had expired did not call for a dismissal, by summary judgment on the ground that the statute barred the action.

        Since an issue of material fact existed as to whether a hospital fraudulently concealed information or misled plaintiffs with regard to the true circumstances surrounding the deaths of certain patients, it was improper for the circuit court to grant motion for summary judgment as the one-year statute may have been tolled by the conduct of the hospital.

        All that is required is that the complaint be filed within the statute of limitations period and that a summons be issued in good faith and CR 3 does not require that actual service on the defendant be effectuated within the statute of limitations period; therefore, where plaintiff was injured on April 7, 1987 and filed his complaint on April 4, 1988, the action was deemed commenced within the one-year statute of limitations period and should not have been dismissed on this ground.

        The defense of limitation could not be presented by demurrer in an action for personal injuries and it was, therefore, unnecessary for the plaintiff to anticipate the defense in his petition, for defendant might have chosen not to plead the statute, but when defendant did plead it, it was proper for the plaintiff to reply and set up matter in avoidance of the plea, showing that the statute had not run.

        Sixth circuit decisions dictate that the district court may not adopt across the board, in federal civil rights cases, the Kentucky five-year limitations period for a liability based on statute, as it would otherwise be inclined to do, rather, a more detailed analysis must be made in each case to determine if some other state cause of action is more analogous to the federal cause of action.

        Because a driver’s activity in releasing the straps and rolling them while a forklift operator unloaded a truck qualified the driver as a participant in the unloading process, the one-year personal injury statute of limitations in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140ol11a" target="_self">413.140(1)(a)</a></cite> applied; therefore, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the companies in the driver’s personal injury action.

        The franchisor is vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of the franchisee when it, in fact, has control or right of control over the daily operation of the specific aspect of the franchisee’s business that is alleged to have caused the harm. Since the franchisor had no control over the franchisee delivery driver’s intentional, tortious conduct in this case, the franchisor cannot be held vicariously liable. Papa John's Int'l, Inc. v.

       <p>
        Statute of limitations on an abuse of process claim is one year, and the cause of action for an abuse of process claim accrues at the time the conduct complained of by the plaintiff occurred, not at the termination of the underlying litigation. Demoisey v. Ostermiller, 2016<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 71</cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2016 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 876 (Ky. Ct. App. May 6, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney complained that the lawyer’s alleged abuse of process occurred either when a malpractice action was filed in 2007 or when the lawyer procured a baseless attorney opinion in 2008 that the attorney had breached the standard of care; as the attorney did not file this action until 2012, his complaint was time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations. Demoisey v. Ostermiller, 2016<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 71</cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2016 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 876 (Ky. Ct. App. May 6, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the attorney might have continued to suffer some damage as a result of the lawsuit and/or legal opinion, the underlying tort was comprised of a single act, and thus the attorney’s abuse of process claim did not meet the definition of a continuing tort for statute of limitation purposes. Demoisey v. Ostermiller, 2016<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 71</cite> (Ky. Ct. App.), sub. op., 2016 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 876 (Ky. Ct. App. May 6, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Property owner’s claim for abuse of process was barred by the one-year statute of limitations because the statute of limitations began to run when the third-party complaint was filed by the attorneys, and the abuse of process claim was not filed until well outside the one-year statute of limitations. RLB Props., Ltd. v. Seiller Waterman, LLC, 2018<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 179</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. June 1, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cause of action for an abuse of process claim accrues at the time the conduct complained of by the plaintiff occurred, not at the termination of the underlying litigation; the circuit court properly concluded that the company brought its abuse of process claim past the one-year limitations period, as the claim began to accrue in October 2014, the company did not file its original complaint until November 2016, and it did not amend its complaint to add the abuse of process claim until February 2017.

       <p>
        Employment relationship existed between the client and the law firm and the law firm missed the one-year statute of limitations in the client's negligence action; consequently, to prevail in the client's legal malpractice action, the client had to show that she would have succeeded in the underlying negligence claim, and as fact issues remained in this regard, summary judgment was improper.

P. 4(m) for failing to serve defendants within 120 days of filing his complaint because the district court did not finish screening the inmate’s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. § 1915(e) and § 1915A(b) until well after the 120-day period, and summonses could not be issued until after screening; because defendants received notice of the suit within the period provided by Rule 4(m), the inmate satisfied Rule 15(c)(1)(C)’ s notice requirement.

    In a tort action arising from a collision between a tractor trailer and a car driven by decedent, plaintiff's loss-of-consortium claim accrued on the day of her husband's accident and was barred by the one-year statute of limitations. She waited nearly three years before she sued two defendants and four years before she sued the third defendant. Richardson v. Rose Transp., Inc., 617 Fed.

        Unpublished decision:
    For all 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 actions, federal courts apply the state personal injury statute of limitations. The appropriate statute of limitations for personal injury actions arising in Kentucky is one year from the date the cause of action accrues. KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.140ol11a" target="_self">413.140(1)(a)</a></cite>; the limitations period begins to run when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his action.

    Because Kentucky law made a civil-forfeiture action a separate, civil proceeding, a forfeiture action brought against an arrestee’s property was not part of the criminal proceedings against him.

        Filing of a collection suit in a court of law by the Cabinet of Health and Human Services against a long-term care facility operator to recoup alleged Medicaid overpayments for the cost year 1996 would have been an “action” contemplated by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.150" target="_self">413.150</a></cite>, but the operator’s payment of the disputed sum to the Cabinet within the five-year period made such an action unnecessary.

        Since the time when this section was enacted, limitation may run against the Commonwealth and it is possible for the statute to have tolled the title of the state before patent was issued.

        The statute of limitations runs against the Commonwealth for adverse possession and, if adverse possessor took possession of land and it continued for 15 years before the Commonwealth issued a patent, it would defeat the patent title.

        The statute of limitations is one of repose and enacted for the purpose of fixing some definite time when every action shall be either brought or barred. Wren's Ex'r v. Wren's Ex'x, 126<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 704</cite>, 104 S.W. 737, 31<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1096</cite>, 1907<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 90</cite> (Ky. 1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of statute of limitations is to bar actions, rather than to suppress defenses, and is intended to close the door of the courts to the bringing of suits on stale claims whether asserted by plaintiffs in regular causes of action or by defendants in counterclaims. Liter v. Hoagland, 305<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc329" target="_blank">Ky. 329</a></cite>, 204 S.W.2d 219, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        In Kentucky the statutes of limitation apply to all actions, whether they are based on equitable or legal rights. Wren's Ex'r v. Wren's Ex'x, 126<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 704</cite>, 104 S.W. 737, 31<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1096</cite>, 1907<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 90</cite> (Ky. 1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule is that statutes of limitation are not applicable to defenses. Liter v. Hoagland, 305<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc329" target="_blank">Ky. 329</a></cite>, 204 S.W.2d 219, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 809</cite> (Ky. 1947).

        Statutes of limitation apply only to rights of action. Potter-Matlock Trust Co. v. Myers, 239 S.W.2d 949, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1107</cite> (Ky. 1950).

        This section does not apply to an action by state highway department to recover the cost of repairs of a bridge damaged by a truck on the theory that subsection (4) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120" target="_self">413.120</a></cite> applies only to a technical trespass and not to damages to real property resulting from negligence.

        Although the testator’s will was lodged in the county clerk’s office in October, 1972, and the action to quiet title was commenced in May, 1983, this section was not applicable where the beneficiary of the will was incompetent, and the action was brought one month after the testator’s wife, who had a life estate, died and the bequest took effect.

        An action to enforce a title bond is not an action for relief not provided for in the statute to which the ten (10) year statute of limitations under this section would apply but an action on a written obligation for performance of an undertaking signed by the parties to which the 15 year statute of limitations under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.090" target="_self">413.090</a></cite> applies.

        Statutes of limitation did not run against remainderman’s right to prevent waste by life tenants who were also cotenants until such waste was committed or threatened. Salyer's Guardian v.

        Plaintiff’s claim for inheritance against his putative father’s estate was not barred by five (5) years or ten (10) years statute of limitations after he reached the age of majority, because at those times his putative father was still living, he was an adult and could not bring action for support, and illegitimate children were absolutely prohibited from inheriting from putative fathers.

        The ten (10) year statute of limitations provided by this section applies to the probating of a will of a person domiciled in this state or domiciled in another state, when the will has not been probated there, and does not apply to the will of a nonresident when the will is recorded at the late domicile of the testator.

        An action by a creditor to subject to a debt of bankrupt a tract of land to which purchaser at sale in bankruptcy had absolute title and held as his own on the ground that there was a verbal agreement between the purchaser and the bankrupt that bankrupt could redeem the property, whether regarded as an action covered by the five (5) year statute embracing parol contracts or by the ten (10) year statute embracing all cases not otherwise provided for, was clearly barred when suit was filed, since there was no continuing or subsisting trust and the action was not an action to recover real estate under the 15 year statute of limitations.

        Any devisee in a will may maintain a proceeding to have it probated, so long as it is not barred by limitations, although other devisees may be barred by limitations. Thompson v.

        The rule that in a joint demise by several, all must have a right of entry which is not barred by the statute of limitations or none can recover is not applicable to coparceners or others who might maintain a several action.

        This section only stops the running of the statute of limitations when the person entitled to bring the action was at the time the cause of action accrued laboring under a disability mentioned in the section. When the statute begins to run, a subsequent disability does not stop it. Fox v. Hudson's Ex'x, 150<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 115</cite>, 150 S.W. 49, 1912<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        It is a generally accepted rule that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until there is a person in being capable of bringing suit. Newby's Adm'r v.

        Suspension, because of infancy, of limitation of time in which an action may be brought is one of statutory origin and is an exception to the statute of limitations. Galloway v.

        This section had no application to an action for the death of a person from an injury inflicted by negligence since the cause of action is vested in the personal representative and the infancy of the widow or an infant child who was not entitled to bring the action could have no effect upon the running of the statute.

        Statutes of limitation apply to all actions whether they are based upon equitable or legal rights and the court has no discretion but must apply them when properly pleaded, although the action is based upon a purely equitable right.

        An action based upon the breach of a covenant in which the recovery of real property is not sought by one laboring under disability at the time the breach occurred is governed by this section and not by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.020" target="_self">413.020</a></cite> which applies to an action for the recovery of real property.

        Representations did not constitute grounds of estoppel and did not toll the statute of limitations under this section because plaintiff was presumed to know that her action for injuries occurring while a guest in assured’s automobile would be barred in one (1) year by statute of limitations and that insurance adjuster was her adversary and she had no right to rely upon his representations that his company had assumed and recognized its liability to her, that a settlement would be made with her when the bills were all in and when she had fully recovered and that she would be fully compensated if she did not consult or employ an attorney.

        With respect to the application of the statute of limitations to a transaction involving a minor, while there is a statutory provision (this section) permitting a minor to bring suit within the same number of years after the minor reaches majority, this statute expressly applies only to the actions mentioned in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.090" target="_self">413.090</a></cite> to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.160" target="_self">413.160</a></cite>, and there is no such saving statute in the Blue Sky Act.

Thus, the tolling provision applied since it was established that the inmate had been of unsound mind since the attack at the jail forming the basis of the action. Green v. Floyd County, 803 F.

        Where husband became obligated to wife on an implied contract in 1929, an action by her administrator after her death subsequent to 1950 to recover on the contract was barred by the statute of limitations, because the disability of a married woman ceased in 1937 even as to previously accrued causes of action.

        District court erred by granting summary judgment in a professional negligence suit brought against defendant attorney who filed a wrongful death action on behalf of an estate; because the real parties in interest were plaintiffs, decedent’s children, all applicable statutes would have been tolled during the period of their infancy in accordance with

        Unpublished decision:
    In plaintiffs’
    proposed 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 class action against a county government and former officials for failing to report the sexual abuse of plaintiffs, the district court properly held that the claims were time-barred because the statute of limitations began to run at the time the individuals were abused or, if they were minors, when they turned eighteen pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.170" target="_self">413.170</a></cite>, and a finding of fraudulent concealment under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.190ol12" target="_self">413.190(2)</a></cite> would not preserve the claims based on the time published newspaper articles put plaintiffs on notice; class certification was properly denied under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 because the class failed on numerosity grounds under Rule 23(a) since only four class members’
    claims were not time-barred with regard to the government and only three were not time-barred with regard to the officials. Guy v. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Gov't, 488 Fed. Appx. 9, 2012 FED App. 0472N, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 9364 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 980, 133 S. Ct. 547, 184 L. Ed. 2d 343, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 8427 (U.S. 2012).

        By this section, it was the evident purpose of the Legislature to provide against the contingency of one’s claim becoming barred by limitation when for some part of the statutory period there was no person in existence whom he had the legal right to sue, so, if four (4) years and six (6)
    months had passed at the time of the debtor’s death since the right to sue had accrued, and the law forbade a suit against his personal representative during the first six (6)
    months after his qualification, it must be manifest that the creditor would lose six (6)
    months of the five (5) years allotted to him by statute if he were not relieved by this section. Southern Contract Co.'s Assignee v. Newhouse, 119<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 704</cite>, 66 S.W. 730, 23<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 2141</cite>, 1902<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 175</cite> (Ky. 1902). But see Johnson v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 137<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc437" target="_blank">Ky. 437</a></cite>, 125 S.W. 1074, 1910<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 587</cite> (Ky. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not make the ancestor’s debt the heir’s but merely imposes on the property descended or devised the ancestor’s liabilities; therefore, when a debtor died, the statutory bar of five (5) years applied to his implied contract to pay back money prematurely distributed as dividends and no administrator was appointed for one (1) month after his death, and no action could, under the statute, be brought against the administrator for six (6)
    months after his appointment, the period of limitation was extended seven (7) months beyond the five (5) years. Southern Contract Co.'s Assignee v. Newhouse, 119<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 704</cite>, 66 S.W. 730, 23<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 2141</cite>, 1902<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 175</cite> (Ky. 1902).

        Where decedent was entitled to bring action and he died before bringing the action and his personal representative qualified at least five (5) years before the expiration of the time limited for the commencement of the action, death of decedent did not suspend the running of the statute for a moment since the words in this section mean that if the personal representative does not bring his suit within the time allowed by the statute — in this case 15 years — he must bring it within one (1) year after he qualifies. Halcomb v. Cornett, 146<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc339" target="_blank">Ky. 339</a></cite>, 142 S.W. 686, 1912<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 69</cite> (Ky. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section extends the statute of limitations only where the qualification of the personal representative was within one (1) year of the expiration of the statutory period and was clearly never intended to authorize parties by their own voluntary acts and conduct to suspend or interrupt the running; therefore, an action by a personal representative who did not qualify until 11 years after his decedent’s death and after statute of limitations had run on the note could not enforce payment of the note. Fix's Ex'r v. Cook, 192<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 731</cite>, 234 S.W. 453, 1921<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 156</cite> (Ky. 1921).

        Considering KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120" target="_self">413.120</a></cite>, this section, and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.34.html#tXXXIVc395s395.270" target="_blank">395.270</a></cite> together, in all causes of action falling under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.120" target="_self">413.120</a></cite>, where the cause of action accrues during the life of the debtor and the debtor dies and an administrator is appointed for his estate more than one (1) year before the expiration of the time limit within which an action might be brought, this section has no application and does not stop the running of the statute during the first six (6)
    months after the administrator is appointed for the evident reason that as the creditor still has at least six (6)
    months in which to sue before the expiration of the time limit, the necessity for the passage of any remedial statute or enabling act is wanting. Johnson v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 137<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc437" target="_blank">Ky. 437</a></cite>, 125 S.W. 1074, 1910<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 587</cite> (Ky. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the debtor dies, and administration is granted on his estate less than one (1) year before the expiration of the time limit within which the suit must be brought, this section applies, provided the suit is commenced within one (1) year after administration is granted. Johnson v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 137<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc437" target="_blank">Ky. 437</a></cite>, 125 S.W. 1074, 1910<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 587</cite> (Ky. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is apparent that the Legislature only intended this section to apply to that class of cases where the debtor died and the administrator was appointed one (1) year or less before expiration of the time limit within which suit might be brought and there is good reason for such a rule, for, conceding that the creditor may not proceed against the administrator during the first six (6)
    months after his qualification, he would still have six (6)
    full months within which to sue. Johnson v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 137<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc437" target="_blank">Ky. 437</a></cite>, 125 S.W. 1074, 1910<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 587</cite> (Ky. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not apply in any case where the death of the debtor occurs more than
    two (2) years before the expiration of the time limit. Johnson v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 137<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc437" target="_blank">Ky. 437</a></cite>, 125 S.W. 1074, 1910<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 587</cite> (Ky. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no administration is granted, this section applies in all cases where the death of the debtor occurs less than
    two (2) years before the expiration of the time limit, provided suit is commenced within
    two (2) years from the death of the debtor. Johnson v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc., 137<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc437" target="_blank">Ky. 437</a></cite>, 125 S.W. 1074, 1910<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 587</cite> (Ky. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        The extension of time given by this section to an administrator applies only to actions which existed in favor of the intestate and survived to the administrator and an action for the death from negligence of his intestate is not such a cause of action, since it never existed in the decedent and does not survive to his administrator but is conferred originally upon the administrator by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc411s411.130" target="_self">411.130</a></cite>.

    two (2) causes of action arise: one for pain and suffering prior to death, and the other for death, and the administrator will be required to elect which cause of action he will prosecute and, since a cause of action for wrongful death is barred in one (1) year from the death while an action for pain and suffering is not barred until one (1) year after the qualification of the personal representative, providing he qualifies within one (1) year from the time of the injury, if he elects to prosecute cause of action for wrongful death which is barred, he cannot amend to prosecute for pain and suffering.

        J died leaving property to his infant daughter. The property was sold to D who executed sale bond in favor of the daughter who died while still an infant. Mother was appointed administratrix of daughter’s estate. No administrator was appointed for J’s estate until shortly before suit.

The court held that (1) statute of limitations was not extended by this section by reason of failure of personal representative of J’s estate to qualify, since right to collect bond was in personal representative of daughter and not personal representative of J, and (2) action was barred by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.090" target="_self">413.090</a></cite>.

        That defendant was at the time the action accrued and had ever since been a nonresident of the state of Kentucky could not relieve the running of the statute of limitations, if it began to run at all, for this section applies only as “against residents of the state.” O'Bannon's Adm'r v. O'Bannon, 76<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 583</cite>, 1878<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1</cite> (Ky. 1878).

       <p>
        While defendant’s claim against nonresident plaintiff might have been properly a counterclaim in a suit on notes it was a defense, and this section does not apply to nonresidents or defenses. Aultman &amp; Taylor Co. v. Meade, 121<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.20.html#tXXc241" target="_blank">Ky. 241</a></cite>, 89 S.W. 137, 28<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        Subsection (1) of this section applies only where the defendant was a resident of this state at the time the cause of action accrued, but was temporarily absent. It does not apply where the defendant was a nonresident. Sword v.

        Prison guard’s threat to plaintiff inmate’s parole if she reported his misconduct did not meet the requirements for tolling under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.190ol12" target="_self">413.190(2)</a></cite> because there was no allegation that the threat was misleading or deceiving. Dishman v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86169 (E.D. Ky. Aug. 20, 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the prisoner guard’s threat to plaintiff inmate’s parole if she reported his misconduct had tolled the statute of limitations under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.190ol12" target="_self">413.190(2)</a></cite>, his threat would not have tolled with respect to defendant correctional center or the warden because the inmate had not alleged that they knew of, or actively concealed, the guard’s specific misconduct or his threat regarding her parole. Dishman v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86169 (E.D. Ky. Aug. 20, 2010).

       <p>
        Wrongful death claim based on a murder was time-barred because (1) the claim was not filed within one year of the murderer's public indictment, and (2) the statute of limitations was not tolled, as nothing showed the murderer absconded or otherwise obstructed prosecution of the claim. Estate of Wittich v. Flick, 519 S.W.3d 774, 2017<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 285</cite> (Ky. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Kentucky law excused plaintiffs' failure to discover defendants' wrongful conduct because the parties' family dynamics were such that plaintiffs trusted their brothers implicitly, and generally deferred to their business judgment. Moreover, defendant brothers reacted aggressively and disparagingly whenever plaintiffs tried to inquire into defendants' management of the family business and their parents' assets. Osborn v. Griffin, 865 F.3d 417, 2017 FED App. 0168P, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 13721 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2017</cite>).

        Where maker of note was employed by a corporation doing business in the city of his residence but was out of the city with his family for the next five (5) years except when he returned for three (3) or four (4) days every three (3) or four (4) months, an instruction to a jury that if they believed the maker of the note was absent from the state, and payees were by reason thereof prevented from suing in the state within the five (5) years then the action was not barred, but, if he changed his residence and was often in the city and payee knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known it then the suit was barred, were not inconsistent. Nunez v. Taylor, 91<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 461</cite>, 16 S.W. 128, 13<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 22</cite>, 1891<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 72</cite> (Ky. 1891).

        The removal of a husband and wife from the state and their continuous residence out of state until the bringing of suit to subject the improvements made by the husband on his wife’s land to the payment of his debt, suspended any statute of limitations and constituted no bar even though plaintiff might have proceeded by attachment and constructive service against the land. Craig's Ex'r v. Anderson, 96<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc425" target="_blank">Ky. 425</a></cite>, 29 S.W. 311, 16<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        Under this section indirect obstruction must amount to some conduct misleading plaintiff so as to prevent him from suing when he desires to do so, and words “defeat or obstruct” imply some act preventing suit which plaintiff cannot with reasonable diligence overcome.

McGill's Adm'x v. Phillips, 243<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 768</cite>, 49 S.W.2d 1025, 1932<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 192</cite> (Ky. 1932).

        Representations of officers of employer to injured employee that they would pay him and were going to settle for injuries if he would not sue together with employee’s reliance thereon were sufficient to obstruct the running of the statute of limitations.

        Where defendant obstructs prosecution of action, such as by concealing plaintiff’s cause of action in such a way that it cannot be discovered by the exercise of ordinary diligence, period of obstruction is not computed as any part of the period within which action must be commenced.

        Restaurant customer’s negligence claim against a restaurant after he contracted hepatitis A after dining there was not time barred even though it was not filed within one year of the customer’s illness because the restaurant engaged in active concealment, and the record reflected that the restaurant manager, in responding to a health department investigation, suppressed the fact that an employee had a hepatitis A infection and poor hygiene and work habits. Although the customer’s suit was filed nearly three years after he fell ill, the statute of limitations was tolled for the entire period of concealment; because the customer filed suit three months after learning of the source of his illness, his suit was timely filed.

        Action for personal injuries was barred under the New York or the Kentucky statutes of limitation where action arose out of an automobile accident which occurred in Kentucky, March 8, 1953, while plaintiff was passenger in an automobile owned and operated by defendant who was a New York resident and on March 6, 1954, plaintiff brought an action in federal court but asked the clerk’s office to retain the complaint and not issue a summons since whereabouts of defendant was unknown and a summons was issued on March 12, 1957, and served, together with the complaint, on March 13, 1957, upon the clerk of the surrogate’s court in New York where the period of limitations was three (3) years.

        The fact defendant had once been a resident of this state and had long prior to the accrual of plaintiff’s cause of action moved therefrom did not prevent the running of the statute of limitations in his favor where he was a bona fide nonresident when plaintiff’s cause of action accrued.

        The limitation statutes do not stop running as to a resident’s cause of action against a nonresident who is such when it accrues, but even if defendant was a resident of the state evidence failed to show such absence of defendant from state as that contemplated by this section.

    claims were not time-barred with regard to the government and only three were not time-barred with regard to the officials. Guy v. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Gov't, 488 Fed.

        When the accounts of administratrix were settled by the commissioner and no exception was filed to his report, the balance in her hands was then due and collectible, and a creditor’s cause of action against the sureties on the bond then accrued and the statute of limitations in favor of sureties was not suspended while the creditors were litigating with others for the purpose of determining how much they were entitled to out of the estate; thus, an action on the administratrix’s bond brought by creditor more than seven (7) years after the cause of action accrued was barred by the statute of limitations.

        An action by a creditor against the administrator of a surety was barred by this section since the death of the surety did not stop the statute of limitations from running nor did the time during which no administrator was appointed. Davis' Adm'r v. Auxier, 41 S.W. 767, 19<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 719</cite> (1897).

        It is a generally accepted rule that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until there is a person in being capable of bringing a suit. Newby's Adm'r v. Warren's Adm'r, 277<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc338" target="_blank">Ky. 338</a></cite>, 126 S.W.2d 436, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 648</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cause of action accrues against the Kentucky Insurance Guaranty Association when substantive reclamation violations occur which would have rendered the insolvent surety liable. Natural Resources &amp; Envtl. Protection Cabinet v. Kentucky Ins. Guar. Ass'n, 972 S.W.2d 276, 1997<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 47</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the violations that gave rise to sureties’ bond forfeitures were unabated and continuing did not constitute an exception to the seven-year limitation period of subsection (3). Natural Resources &amp; Envtl. Protection Cabinet v. Kentucky Ins. Guar. Ass'n, 972 S.W.2d 276, 1997<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 47</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The filing of proofs of claims with liquidators for insolvent sureties was irrelevant to the requirement of subsection (3) that suit against the Kentucky Insurance Guaranty Association within seven (7) years of the accrual of the cause of action. Natural Resources &amp; Envtl. Protection Cabinet v. Kentucky Ins. Guar. Ass'n, 972 S.W.2d 276, 1997<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 47</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).

        Contracts undertaking to fix a longer period of limitation than that established by statute are void. Citizens Bank of Shelbyville v.

        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The waiver of “extensions of time of payment” was a waiver simply of the surety’s right to claim an immediate release from liability upon a mere indulgence to the maker, and was not to be considered as a waiver of the statute of limitations. Citizens Bank of Shelbyville v. Hutchison, 272<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc195" target="_blank">Ky. 195</a></cite>, 113 S.W.2d 1148, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        The direction in a will to pay the testator’s “just debts” does not waive the bar of limitations, since the term “just debts” meant “legal debts.” Jones' Ex'r v. Jones, 275<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 753</cite>, 122 S.W.2d 779, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 504</cite> (Ky. 1938).

       <p>
        Since sureties on performance bonds of corporation that had received permits to engage in surface mining could not be deemed to be in default until the date upon which they refused to honor their obligations as sureties after being called upon to do so, where no claims were asserted against sureties until 1993 when they were notified by letter that mining corporation had been cited for noncompliance and that state was entitled to undertake the required reclamation work and state filed action when the bonds were not honored, since it is clear from the record that a cause of action was filed against surety within 7 years of its right to institute suit, such claims were not barred by limitations.

        The five (5) year statute of limitations under this section was applicable to bar an action brought, more than five (5) years after a final settlement, by a relative excluded from the final settlement, against the surety on the administrator’s bond on the ground that the final settlement was procured through the fraud and collusion of the administrator and certain relatives.

        This section prescribes the only conditions or acts that will operate to suspend the running of the seven (7) year statute of limitations relating to sureties provided in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.230" target="_self">413.230</a></cite> and an action brought by relative against administrator, other relatives and the surety on the administrator’s bond seeking to surcharge final settlement made more than seven (7) years previously on the ground of fraud and collusion by and between the administrator and the other relatives, was barred as to the surety since none of the alleged conduct upon the part of the administrator or other parties to the suit for the settlement would operate to suspend the running of the statute in favor of the surety on the administrator’s bond. Tucker v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 270<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 723</cite>, 110 S.W.2d 649, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 144</cite> (Ky. 1937).

        The Kentucky Legislature often uses alternatives to the phrase “statute of limitations” to refer to legislatively imposed limitations periods. In other cases, a legislatively prescribed statute of limitation is referred to merely as a “limitation” or as a “time of limitation,” both of which terms occur in this section. Curry v. Vanguard Ins. Co., 923 F.2d 484, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 885 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1991</cite>).

        Evidence that surety had moved with his family to Washington and then to Georgia where he purchased property and went into business there justified the court in submitting to the jury the issue of whether a surety has been absent “by removal” from the state within this section, so as to prevent the bar by limitation described by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.220" target="_self">413.220</a></cite>.

        Delay of creditor to sue beyond the period of seven (7) years, when procured by fraud of the surety, is properly treated as an obstruction or hindrance. Newton v.

        Where a surety, who was mailed a renewal note about a month before the statute of limitations ran on the original note and was asked to sign it and mail it to the principal, delayed signing it until the last day and when the principal received it he refused to sign it, there was no obstruction or hindrance by the surety of his being sued and the act of the surety in signing the note was not “a delay assented to by the surety in writing.” Reid v.

        In an action against surety on a note where surety procured principal to deposit money in payee bank so that the bank could appropriate the deposit to the payment of its debt, the joint acts of the surety and the principal put it out of the bank’s power to sue until after a final decision in an action brought by other creditors to declare the deposit an illegal preference so the period intervening between the appropriation of the deposit by the bank and the decision in the creditor’s suit to declare the deposit an illegal preference should be deducted from the seven (7) year period of limitation running in favor of the surety.

        An executor of a surety in causing the creditor to refrain from suing and in postponing the reference of the case to the commissioner, thereby preventing the filing of notes before him within seven (7) years from and after their maturity, is estopped to rely on the statute of limitations in favor of sureties.

        Statements made by surety to creditor, before the statute of limitations had run, that he would pay the note if the principal did not, are not such an “obstructing” or “hindering” of suit as to stop the running of the statute.

    Upon the plain language of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.241" target="_self">413.241</a></cite> and persuasive decisional law, a minor has a valid claim against the dram shop that sells him alcohol thereby causing or contributing to his injuries; the result should be the same whether the sale or service of alcohol is to a minor or to an intoxicated person.

        Distinction between the accrual and discovery rules is important because, when properly applied, the accrual rule means that the limitations period does not even begin to run until the cause of action accrues; until that time, no cause of action yet exists, meaning a lawsuit would be premature and should be dismissed. A plaintiff’s statute of limitations claim must be evaluated separately under both the accrual and discovery rules. Queensway Fin. Holdings Ltd. v. Cotton &amp; Allen, P.S.C., 237 S.W.3d 141, 2007<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 212</cite> (Ky. 2007).

        The statute of limitations starts to run when the party discovers that a wrong has been committed, not when the party discovers that he may sue for the wrong; accordingly, the statute of limitations on a legal malpractice action began to run when plaintiff was first told that she had been inadequately represented in previous action and not some six weeks later when she was told that she had grounds for a legal malpractice action. Conway v. Huff, 644 S.W.2d 333, 1982<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 327</cite> (Ky. 1982).

       <p>
        Until the client suffers appreciable harm as a consequence of his attorney’s negligence, the client cannot establish a cause of action for malpractice; it follows that the statute of limitations does not begin to run against a negligence action until some damage has occurred. Northwestern Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Osborne, 573 F. Supp. 1045, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12060 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1983</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The occurrence of appreciable harm sufficient to commence the running of this statute of limitations is a question of fact; however, where there is no dispute concerning the material facts, it becomes a question of law for the court. Northwestern Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Osborne, 573 F. Supp. 1045, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12060 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1983</cite>).

        The knowledge that one has been wronged and by whom starts the running of the statute of limitations for professional malpractice, not the knowledge that the wrong is actionable. Graham v. Harlin, Parker &amp; Rudloff, 664 S.W.2d 945, 1983<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 351</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1983), overruled,

        The use of the word “occurrence” in this section, indicates a legislative policy that there should be some definable, readily ascertainable event which triggers the statute.

        Where insurer, which settled action brought by insured for damages for loss of house by fire and for wrongful denial of coverage after default was entered against it for its alleged failure to produce witnesses for depositions and other alleged violations of civil rules, brought malpractice action against the attorney who had represented it in such action, the malpractice statute of limitations began to run against that attorney as soon as the insurer had an irrevocable nonspeculative injury, which occurred when it retained an independent attorney and billable services were rendered by such attorney for the insured. Northwestern Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Osborne, 610 F. Supp. 126, 1985 U.S. Dist.

        The client’s knowledge of the judicial sale of his farm, necessitated to satisfy the default judgment against him, was sufficient knowledge that he was injured by his attorney’s advice as contemplated by the discovery rule incorporated in this section.

       <p>
        In a legal malpractice action, the cause of action does not accrue until the appellate process is final. The malpractice claimant is put on sufficient notice when the appeal is final and the trial court’s judgment is the unalterable law of the case. Only then is the malpractice claimant put on notice that the principal damage (the adverse judgment) is real, and more importantly only then can he justifiably claim that the entire damage is proximately caused by counsel’s failure, for which he might seek a remedy; and not by the trial court’s error, for which he would have none. Hibbard v. Taylor, 837 S.W.2d 500, 1992<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 136</cite> (Ky. 1992).

       <p>
        The “continuous representation rule” is a branch of the discovery which says that by virtue of the attorney-client relationship, there can be no effective discovery of legal negligence so long as the relationship prevails; therefore, it tolls the legal negligence statute of limitations so long as attorney continues to represent the client in the matter. Alagia, Day, Trautwein &amp; Smith v. Broadbent, 882 S.W.2d 121, 1994<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 73</cite> (Ky. 1994).

        Because any damages plaintiff suffered as a result of any alleged professional malpractice of defendants in handling his will contest became fixed and non-speculative on the day the Kentucky Supreme Court denied discretionary review, the one-year statute of limitations under this section began to run on that date and thus plaintiff’s complaint was not filed within the period and was properly dismissed; had plaintiff sought a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court within the 90-day period following the ruling, the statute of limitations would have been tolled pending ruling. Barker v. Miller, 918 S.W.2d 749, 1996<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 55</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).

        Damage to a middle school was fixed and non-speculative on the date that the board of education first learned that the middle school was damaged and, therefore, the one (1) year statute of limitations for professional malpractice against a geo-technical engineering services provider began to run on that date; a contrary result was not required by the fact that the board may not have known the full extent of the damage or even who was responsible, as the important and ultimately dispositive point was that the board knew of damage. Bd. of Educ. v. Zurich Ins. Co., 180 F. Supp. 2d 890, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 678 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2002</cite>), aff'd, 84 Fed.

        Where the parties’ contract established a one-year time limitation for claims, the contract did not violate public policy and the discovery rule of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.245" target="_self">413.245</a></cite> was inapplicable; therefore, because the owner’s breach of contract and breach of warranty of merchantability action against the architect was brought 13 years after the home was completed, the trial court properly dismissed the action.

        Where a patient alleged that a doctor was negligent and fraudulently concealed the dangers of certain diet drugs because he failed to advise her to undergo a thorough cardiovascular examination, the patient’s medical negligence and fraud claims were barred by the statute of limitations because they were not filed within one (1) year after the patient knew or should have known of her injuries and her claims. The patient had constructive knowledge of her claims against the doctor from the extensive national and local media coverage concerning the withdrawal of the drugs from the market. Collett v.

        When professional negligence occurs during the course of formal litigation, the injury becomes definite and non-speculative when the underlying case is final; the statute of limitations on a client’s legal malpratice claim, which alleged that a lawyer lost her medical records, which in turn forced the client to settle her products liability suit for a fraction of its value, began to run on the date that the client settled her underlying products liability claim, and where the client filed her suit against the lawyer within one (1) year of the date of that settlement, the legal malpractice claim was timely.

        The present law of Kentucky requires the following three elements for the accrual of a cause of action for legal malpractice: (1) a negligent act or omission on the part of the attorney; (2) the occurrence of damage that is not merely speculative as a proximate result of such act or omission; (3) discovery of the negligence and damage by the client.

        Legal malpractice action was premature when filed and was not ripe where damages were not fixed and non-speculative and where the federal class action cases on which the malpractice case was based were not final when the malpractice complaint was filed. Since the legal malpractice action had not accrued when the case was filed, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, erroneously made a summary judgment order, and the case had to be dismissed without prejudice.

        All of a client's claims against an attorney for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duties, and professional negligence were time-barred, as the client's second complaint was filed outside the one-year statute of limitations, because the claims arose from the attorney's professional services as the contract between the parties, although not an engagement letter, set forth professional services, albeit some non-legal, to be performed by the attorney and the claims were not tolled by a federal lawsuit.

        Unpublished decision:
    Former client’s lawsuit against her former attorney for legal malpractice was time-barred under the statute of limitations for legal malpractice because the client did not file the lawsuit until more than one year after the client learned of the attorney’s negligence. The statute of limitations was not tolled by the fact that the client sought to reopen the client’s divorce proceeding through the use of a CR 60.02 motion. Faris v. Stone, 103 S.W.3d 1, 2003<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 71</cite> (Ky. 2003).

        Unpublished decision:
    Insurer’s subrogation action for malpractice against inspectors of the insureds’
    proposed school location was time-barred under Kentucky’s one-year statute of limitations, as the limitations period began to run when the insureds discovered damage to the completed school due to the rising of earth beneath the school building, as the damage to the school was “fixed and non-speculative.” Estill County Bd. of Educ. v. Zurich Ins. Co., 84 Fed. Appx. 516, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 25695 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2003</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unpublished decision:
    In applying KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.245" target="_self">413.245</a></cite>, the phrase “fixed and non-speculative” is more properly interpreted as tolling the limitations period for professional negligence claims until the plaintiff is certain that damages will indeed flow from defendant’s negligent act; the statute requires that in order for the limitations period to commence, the plaintiff must be aware that the plaintiff has in fact been damaged by the defendant’s negligence, but the statute does not require that the plaintiff be aware of the precise dollar amount or even the exact extent of the damage. Estill County Bd. of Educ. v. Zurich Ins. Co., 84 Fed. Appx. 516, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 25695 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2003</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unpublished decision:
    In the context of the statute of limitations contained in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.245" target="_self">413.245</a></cite>, the fact that the parties could not agree on the cost of repairs, or which insurance company would be responsible for them, does not render the alleged legal injury “speculative;” the process of litigation itself is where the amount of damages become fixed and non-speculative, and that litigation cannot commence until the fact of damage is fixed. Estill County Bd. of Educ. v. Zurich Ins. Co., 84 Fed. Appx. 516, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 25695 (6th Cir.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 2003</cite>).

        An action was commenced by the filing in the proper court of a petition stating the cause of action, and by causing a summons to be issued or warning order to be made therein and where plaintiff filed his petition and procured the warning order within the prescribed time he had an action pending in court, and an attachment levied subsequently on defendant’s property was valid although the petition was amended at the time of the attachment and no new warning order or summons issued. Fremd v. Ireland, 33 S.W. 89, 17<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1140</cite> (1895). (See KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.42.html#tXXXXIIc454s454.210" target="_blank">454.210</a></cite>.).
       </p>
       <p>
        An action is not commenced until a summons is issued or a warning order made thereon and, where plaintiff knew defendant was a nonresident, issuance of a summons that could not be served within the time prescribed by the statute of limitations was not sufficient to stop the running of the statute. Traders' Deposit Bank v. Hoffman, 99<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 240</cite>, 35 S.W. 631, 18<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 148</cite>, 1896<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Where plaintiff and his attorney did not know defendant was a nonresident the filing of petitions and issuing of summons against defendant stopped the running of the statute of limitations.

        An action against a nonresident was commenced by obtaining a warning order. Hyden v. Calames, 161<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 593</cite>, 171 S.W. 186, 1914<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a summons, rather than a warning order, was issued in an action filed two (2) days after the defendant left the state, the plaintiff’s knowledge of the defendant’s leaving was not alone sufficient to show that they knew that he was no longer a resident of the state and, therefore, in the absence of further proof, the issuance of summons was deemed to be in good faith. Appleton v. Southern Trust Co., 244<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.42.html#tXXXXIIc453" target="_blank">Ky. 453</a></cite>, 51 S.W.2d 447, 1932<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Where action for wrongful death brought by nonresident administrator was not maintainable because administrator had no authority to sue in Kentucky, the filing of the action did not operate to suspend the running of the statute of limitations; therefore an attempt, after the statute had run, to substitute as plaintiff an ancillary administrator appointed in Kentucky, was too late.

        Plaintiff’s contention that her failure to comply with the applicable statutes and Civil Rule regarding commencement of actions was induced by statements of adjusters for defendant’s insurance company did not afford a basis for estoppel to plead limitations; if in fact such agreement as plaintiff alleged did exist, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc413s413.265" target="_self">413.265</a></cite> provided a legitimate, binding manner to memorialize and enforce the same.

    action did not commence until a summons was actually issued; the statute of limitations was not equitably tolled simply because plaintiffs moved to file an amended complaint within the one-year time frame.

        Action arising out of an automobile accident occurring March 8, 1953 in Kentucky, while plaintiff was a passenger in an automobile owned and operated by defendant’s decedent, filed in federal court against administrator on March 6, 1954, was barred by the one (1) year statute of limitations under this section and the three (3) year New York statute of limitations where clerk’s office was asked to retain the complaint and not issue summons because the whereabouts of driver’s administrator was unknown and on March 13, 1957, complaint was served upon the clerk of the New York surrogate court.

        When plaintiff has filed its petition setting forth its cause of action, and has caused a summons to issue thereon in time to save its right of action, it has done all that the law requires it to do for it is the official duty of the clerk to issue the summons and to see to its proper delivery to the sheriff.

        Filing of petition without issuance of summons held not “commencement of action” which would stop running of limitation. Simpson v. Antrobus, 260<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 641</cite>, 86 S.W.2d 544, 1935<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 534</cite> (Ky. 1935).

       <p>
        When a party has caused the summons to issue in good faith he has complied with the law and saved the right of action in respect of time, for it is the official duty of the clerk to see that the process is delivered to the sheriff for service, and of the sheriff or one of his deputies to attend the clerk’s office daily to receive such process as may have been issued and where there was nothing in the record to show that summons was not issued in good faith but simply that it did not reach the office of the sheriff until after the period of limitation had expired, the action was not barred. Blue Grass Mining Co. v. Stamper, 267<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 643</cite>, 103 S.W.2d 112, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 376</cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        A delay of six (6) weeks in placing summons in process of execution, without excuse and without circumstances indicating a present intention of having the summons executed would be sufficient to show lack of good faith.

       </p>
       <p>
        Negligence in the execution of a summons until after statutory period has run does not of itself bar the right of action, but a negligent delay, if of sufficient length of time, may indicate lack of good faith.

        Where petition was filed within the statute of limitations, but no evidence was available that summons had been delivered to sheriff for service on defendant, six (6) months had passed, and the statute of limitations had run before another summons was obtained, the “good faith” in the issuing of process necessary for the “commencement” of an action so as to toll the statute of limitations had been destroyed.

    not attempt to serve any of the defendants with the summons, her claim

        Action against Kentucky resident by Virginia resident for personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident occurring in Kentucky was not barred by the Kentucky one (1) year statute of limitations since plaintiffs had done everything possible to protect their rights where their attorney, prior to the expiration of the one (1) year statute, attempted to file their complaint, found the clerk’s office closed, contacted the deputy clerk at her home, took the complaints to her, paid the required fees and delivered the summons with a request they be issued but summonses were not issued until after expiration of the one (1) year period.

        Fact that clerk’s indorsement on petition showed that it was filed on April 21, 1930 was not conclusive that action was commenced at that time, where record showed that summons was issued and served on April 21, 1931, and it was apparent that indorsement of 1930 date was a clerical misprision.

        Whether plaintiff’s action would be dismissed depended entirely on whether the federal or Kentucky rule for commencing an action applied, since the complaint was filed within the statutory period but summons was issued after the statute of limitations had expired; in this case, it was determined that state law determined when the statute of limitations was tolled.

        In diversity suit that arose out of an auto accident, amendments to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing commencement of actions at filing of complaint were not in conflict with Kentucky law which provided that suit was commenced not at the time the complaint was filed but rather on the date of the first summons or process issued in good faith from the court having jurisdiction of the cause; thus where summons did not issue until after the statute of limitations had run the suit was barred.

        The words “restrained or suspended” should not be given a broad meaning since statutes of limitation are denominated as statutes of repose, and rest upon a sound public policy tending to the peace and welfare of society and their provisions should not be lightly evaded.

        This section had no application where creditor sought to avoid statutory bar in a suit to subject conveyance made to debtor as trustee for her infant son on the ground that debtor had resisted her liability on a note in a suit brought by creditor thereby delaying a judgment against her for four (4) years since the mere fact debtor resisted her liability on the note did not act as a restraint because it was not necessary that creditor have a judgment against debtor on the note before proceeding against the trust fund.

        Litigation between counties, municipalities and other banks in which Court of Appeals held it was proper for the other banks to pay taxes into state treasury instead of to counties and cities was no legal restraint on plaintiff bank which would suspend the running of the statute of limitations under this section, and plaintiff bank was barred from compelling the auditor to refund the taxes it had paid into the state treasury in reliance on that decision where plaintiff bank made no application to the auditor for refund until after the Supreme Court of the United States overruled the Court of Appeals and the statute of limitations had run.

        The refusal of the United States Circuit Court to sustain plaintiff’s motion to dismiss his action at the time it was made and the judgment entered was a lawful restraint under this section preventing the plaintiff from instituting the action he afterwards instituted when the action was dismissed by mandate of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals; thus, the time between the refusal to sustain plaintiff’s motion to dismiss and the dismissal on mandate should not be counted in the application of the statute of limitations.

        When plaintiff has shown the proper diligence required by the applicable statute of limitations but has filed in an improper court, the saving statute provides him a further period of time in which to find the proper court, and if subsequent abortive attempts are not prosecuted in bad faith the number of such attempts is immaterial so long as the proper court is found before the grace period runs.

        Property owners’ claim against a Cabinet was properly dismissed as time-barred because, (1) while the claim did not have to be filed with the Board of Claims within one year, as a filing in the wrong forum in due time suspended the one-year period of waiver of immunity, the claim had to be filed within one year of accrual, as the savings statute’s qualifier, “If an action is commenced in due time” meant filing within the statutory period of waiver of immunity, not the five-year statute of limitations for property damage claims, since the savings statute only conferred jurisdiction, rather than waiving immunity, and (2) the claim was not filed within one year.

        This “borrowing statute,” which borrows the time limitation period of another state where a cause of action accrues when that period is shorter than Kentucky’s to bar the action from being brought in Kentucky, does not violate the fundamental right of a person to interstate travel.

        Court of appeals erred in concluding that the statute required the application of the Alabama statute of limitation because clients’
    claims against attorneys were governed by the Kentucky statute of limitations since their causes of action accrued in Kentucy, not Alabama; because “when” a cause of action accrues is closely connected to “where” it accrues, knowing when the “final act” occurred that ripened the matter into a cause of action aids in ascertaining where the cause of action accrued. Abel v. Austin, 411 S.W.3d 728, 2013<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 458</cite> (Ky. 2013).

        Stated simply, if the action accrued in a state other than Kentucky, the shortest statute of limitations applies. If the action accrued in Kentucky, Kentucky's statute of limitations applies. Tomlin v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 2368 (Bankr. E.D. Ky. June 23, 2016).

        Action to recover for personal injuries resulting from a motor vehicle collision in the state of Ohio was barred by the Kentucky statute of limitations when not filed within one (1) year, for the reason that the Kentucky statute was shorter than the Ohio statute which provided the limitation of two (2) years as to such actions.

        The federal statutes provided no period of limitation for actions to enforce the liability of national bank stockholders, and accordingly the statute of limitations of the state in which the action was brought was applicable.

        The Kentucky statutes of limitation, including this section, were not, in view of the inapplicability of renovi doctrine, applicable to an action brought in Indiana against an Ohio defendant for injuries sustained in an accident in Kentucky. Under the Indiana “borrowing statute,” directing the Indiana court to apply the limitation provisions of the state of residence of the nonresident defendant, the specific limitation provision of Ohio applicable to personal injury actions and not Ohio’s “borrowing statute,” which would have applied the limitation of Kentucky, the state where the injury occurred, was applicable.

        To the extent that plaintiffs resided in states other than Kentucky and felt the economic impact of the bond default in their respective states of residence, those states represent the place where the economic injury was suffered; therefore, the limitation for plaintiffs’ § 10 of the Securities Act of 1934 claim was governed by Kentucky’s borrowing statute rather than the statute of limitations embodied in Kentucky’s blue sky law.

        The federal district court applied the limitation statute of the foreign state and not that of Kentucky, where under Kentucky law the foreign statute of limitation applied if it was for a longer time, because the federal court was bound by the construction presently placed on the Kentucky statute by state courts even if it was satisfied that the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, when called upon to construe the statute, would embrace the law of the forum which was the prevailing law in 47 other states.

        In an action challenging the transfer of trust assets, a Kentucky district court had to apply Kentucky limitation period to the trust beneficiaries’ claims, even though the cause of action arose in Illinois, since Illinois’ limitation period was not shorter than Kentucky's.

        A grant of a right of way to a corporation, with a provision of reverter, did not cease or revert and could not be reclaimed by the grantor on the ground that the corporation had committed a breach of its charter for which it might be subject to judgment of forfeiture. It was for the public to determine if there was cause for forfeiture, and if so, institute public proceedings. Harrison v. Lexington &amp; F. R.

        A forfeiture of charter can be had by the state only, at the instance of the Attorney General; thus, a corporation was not only in existence but possessed full power to maintain an action until actual forfeiture although it had violated the statutes and was subject to fine and forfeiture.

        Under the Constitution of Kentucky the Legislature had no authority to create a city or to convert a taxing district into a city of the fifth class, as it only had power to assign incorporated cities and towns to the class in which they belonged, and a citizen and taxpayer of the city had the right, more than two (2) years after the city was organized, to bring a suit attacking its creation as being in violation of the constitution. Hurley v. Motz, 151<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.42.html#tXXXXIIc451" target="_blank">Ky. 451</a></cite>, 152 S.W. 248, 1913<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 495</cite> (Ky. 1913).

        The failure of the incorporators of a sixth-class city to comply essentially with the statutory requirements of incorporation makes the body defective but not void, and an action to vacate its charter can be brought and prosecuted only by the Attorney General or under his sanction and direction by an attorney for the Commonwealth. Vanover v. Dunlap, 172<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 679</cite>, 189 S.W. 915, 1916<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 255</cite> (Ky. 1916).

       <p>
        In a proceeding to correct the boundaries of a town of the sixth class, that had by its judgment of incorporation, substantially exceeded the statutory limits of boundary permitted for towns of its class, the court determined that it had obtained de facto status, and the inclusion of a greater area in its boundaries than permitted by statute was a mere irregularity and could only be attacked in proceedings instituted by the Commonwealth.

        Where all the stock of a waterworks corporation had been acquired by the city, and the corporation had failed to elect a board of directors possessing the necessary qualifications, suit for forfeiture or to vacate charter can only be brought in the name of the commonwealth, and the question of forfeiture is not subject to collateral inquiry in an action by a private citizen.

        In a proceeding by the attorney general seeking the forfeiture of a turnpike charter and alleging that the corporation had wilfully violated its charter rights in demanding and collecting tolls from patrons of its turnpike, the court in deciding that the charter should not be forfeited, stated that the processes of the criminal courts should have been invoked to remedy the evils complained of before forfeiture of charter was sought.

        The creation of, or annexation of, new territory to a town was a matter within the sole discretion of the Legislature, and did not in any manner depend upon the will of a majority or any inhabitants living within the territory. But if the Legislature did consult their wishes, as it well could, it acted for its advice and guidance, and not in deference to any legal right of the citizen. Cheaney v. Hooser, 48<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc330" target="_blank">Ky. 330</a></cite>, 1848<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 73</cite> (Ky. 1848) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the Legislature enacted a new charter for a town and provided that it should become effective only upon its acceptance by a majority of the legal voters of the town, it was determined by the court in a proceeding involving the constitutionality of the provision that the Legislature cannot delegate its powers to make laws; but, when enacted, whether or not the law shall become operative may be made to depend on the popular will of the inhabitants of the town. Clarke v. Rogers, 81<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc43" target="_blank">Ky. 43</a></cite>, 4<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        A statute, under attack as being unconstitutional, enacted by the Legislature conferring upon Circuit Courts the right to establish towns in the state under certain conditions and providing that no appeal shall lie from the judgment of the lower courts, was held to be within, and not in violation of, Const., §§ 28 and 126, and the power conferred on the Circuit Courts was not legislative and not subject to appeal. Morton v. Woodford, 99<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc367" target="_blank">Ky. 367</a></cite>, 35 S.W. 1112, 18<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        The Legislature has the authority to grant to a city of the third class as part of its charter, provisions for the annexation of territory by ordinance, and such authority carries with it the right to annex another city, providing that the city so annexing the territory shall be bound for all debts and liabilities of the annexed municipal corporation. Pence v. Frankfort, 101<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc534" target="_blank">Ky. 534</a></cite>, 41 S.W. 1011, 19<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

       </p>
       <p>
        The creation, enlargement and the dissolution of municipal corporations are exclusively legislative functions, and may be exercised alone by the legislative department of the government, and the act incorporating cities is not unconstitutional in those sections conferring upon the Circuit Courts a supervisory jurisdiction over the annexation of territory, at the suit of a citizen affected by such annexation, as conferring on the courts legislative functions. Lewis v. Brandenburg, 105<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc14" target="_blank">Ky. 14</a></cite>, 47 S.W. 862, 20<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        A dissolution of an incorporated town that has been placed in its proper class by the Legislature can only be effected by the Legislature, so in an action to enjoin ineligible officers from acting, the fact that for many years the town had decreased in size, had not exercised the powers and rights granted to it by its charter and had failed to elect officers had not worked a dissolution. Hill v. Anderson, 122<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc87" target="_blank">Ky. 87</a></cite>, 90 S.W. 1071, 28<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        In a petition seeking to restrain the appointed trustee from acting or alleging that none of the rights and powers granted to the town had been exercised for 17 years, the court determined that the action would not lie to restrain disqualified officers of a town from exercising the duties of their office since there was an adequate remedy at law providing penalty for usurpation of office.

        Where a municipal corporation was organized in good faith, under a valid statute authorizing the incorporation, and has assumed the exercise of corporate powers, the judgment of incorporation is only subject to attack by the state in a direct proceeding to forfeit its franchise.

        The power to create or dissolve a municipal corporation belongs exclusively to the Legislature and cannot be delegated to or exercised by the judiciary; however, the general assembly may enact a general law for the creation or dissolution of a municipal corporation of the sixth class which is to take effect upon the happening of an event, or the existence of certain facts, and it may authorize a court to ascertain the event or the existence of the facts upon which the statute has application, and it will not thereby delegate to the court a legislative function.

        The courts should be slow to invoke estoppel against the state in its efforts to enforce a statute the purpose of which is to prevent “conflict of interest” situations and to prevent self-interest in the deliberation of public servants.

        In the past the historical development of this section justified the conclusion that it was an exclusive course of procedure for removal of an official or a usurper and that concept should continue to prevail generally, but in the present case KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc156s156.480" target="_blank">156.480</a></cite> is clear and unequivocal that it the status or misconduct condemned is proven it automatically works a forfeiture of the incumbent school official’s right to the office.

        This section which is applicable to usurpers only does not apply to owners and thus it does not provide an exclusive remedy for revoking a ferry franchise. An action to revoke a ferry franchise because of continued nonresidence of the owner for more than one year is governed by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.24.html#tXXIVc280s280.180" target="_blank">280.180</a></cite> (now repealed),<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.24.html#tXXIVc280s280.200" target="_blank">280.200,</a></cite> and<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.24.html#tXXIVc280s280.220" target="_blank">280.220.</a></cite> Crittenden County v.

        KRS, ch. 415 provides the exclusive mode for testing title to duly created city offices to which officers have been elected and only one claiming title to the office or the Attorney General may maintain an action to oust an alleged usurper. Jenkins v. Congleton, 242<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc46" target="_blank">Ky. 46</a></cite>, 45 S.W.2d 456, 1932<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 209</cite> (Ky. 1932).

        This section did not apply to an action by eight duly elected county magistrates to enjoin three persons elected commissioners at a void special election from interfering with their office, for the action was not an action to prevent usurpation of office since the title to magistrate was not in question. Patterson v. Lawson, 255<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 781</cite>, 75 S.W.2d 507, 1934<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 330</cite> (Ky. 1934).

        This section does not apply to removal of Commonwealth’s Attorney on grounds of misbehavior for he is a constitutional officer removable under §§ 67 and 97 of the Kentucky Constitution only.

        Abandonment of an office is quite different from forfeiture which may be adjudged only in a suit by the Commonwealth or a person entitled thereto under this section, and other board members may bring an action to determine if a member of county board of education has abandoned his office.

        A usurper is one who intrudes himself into an office that is vacant or without color of title or right, ousts the incumbent and assumes to act as an officer by exercising some of the functions of the office.

        Where corporation’s ownership of franchise was uncontroverted it was the proper party to initiate the action authorized by this section for usurpation of the franchise and it was not required that the governmental unit which granted the franchise be made a party to the action.

        In a proceeding seeking mandamus against a county fiscal court to recover the office of justice of the peace that has been usurped by another, the one seeking to recover it in his own name, must, as the plaintiff in every other case must do, show legal title to that which he demands. Justices of Jefferson County v. Clark, 17<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc82" target="_blank">Ky. 82</a></cite>, 1824<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        In an action to quash the return of a summons executed by sheriff, who had entered upon his official duties without giving the bond and taking the oath required by law, it was determined that a vacancy or forfeiture of an office must be declared by a direct proceeding, and until a vacancy or forfeiture shall have been declared the official acts of the sheriff were valid as to third parties and could not be collaterally questioned. Stokes v. Kirkpatrick, 58<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc138" target="_blank">Ky. 138</a></cite>, 1858<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        While a certificate of election is conclusive of election of the one claiming the office in any collateral proceeding in which title to the office might be involved, it is not conclusive of the claimant’s eligibility when it is denied, in a direct proceeding against him involving his right to exercise the duties of the office, to prevent him from liability.

        The acceptance and continuing to hold any office of trust or profit under the United States by an incumbent thereby vacates any civil office which he holds in Kentucky or to which he may be elected. But the one who seeks to recover it from another who is in possession of it, must show a right in himself before he can recover, and a certificate of election, or even a commission, is not prima facie evidence of eligibility to the office. Hoglan v. Carpenter, 67<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc89" target="_blank">Ky. 89</a></cite>, 1868<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        A defeated candidate may bring a suit to set aside the election upon grounds specified in the statute even though the petition does not show that he himself was elected to the office. If the law were otherwise, there might be no way to void an election which had been carried by the grossest of frauds because the action of quo warranto cannot be brought for the reason that the contestee holding the election certificate is not a usurper. Scholl v. Bell, 125<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 750</cite>, 102 S.W. 248, 31<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 335</cite>, 1907<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 328</cite> (Ky. 1907).

        Where the charter of a city or town has been repealed by an act of the Legislature and a new act of incorporation granted, it is the creation of a new city government, with its civil and police jurisdiction and manner of electing its officers, therefore one claiming the office of city judge under an election not authorized by the city charter cannot recover it from the incumbent.

        The fact that the candidate for county court clerk who received a majority of the votes cast at an election died before the polls closed, does not give the only surviving candidate the right to the office, and he cannot maintain an action against a usurper, because he cannot recover for want of title in another claiming the office.

        Although it was true members of city council had not qualified and were usurpers of the offices they held, a citizen and taxpayer of a city who did not claim he was entitled to hold any of the offices could not bring an action to oust the members of the city council from office upon the ground that they failed to take the oaths required by the Constitution and statutes.

        Under the commission form of government, in a city of the second class, one is not eligible to be either voted for or elected to the office of commissioner unless he has first been nominated in the primary election provided for by the statute previous to the regular election, and his election to the office without such nomination does not give him any title to it, and he cannot recover it in an action in his own name from one who has no right to hold it. A certificate of election is no evidence of the eligibility of one to hold an office when his eligibility is denied in a direct proceeding against him. Hermann v.

        Under statute prescribing qualifications of members of county boards of education and specifying disqualification which will operate as a forfeiture of office, the Attorney General may bring an action against the usurper of the office challenging his educational qualification, and the burden is on the member to show that his education meets the requirements of the statute. Chadwell v. Commonwealth, 288<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 644</cite>, 157 S.W.2d 280, 1941<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 182</cite> (Ky. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action filed by Attorney General for the Commonwealth under this section seeking to oust a member of a county board of education from office on the sole ground that the defendant did not possess the educational qualifications of having completed at least the eighth grade in the common schools, as shown by the records of the schools or affidavits of teachers, as required by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc160s160.180" target="_blank">160.180</a></cite>, evidence was insufficient to establish the fact that defendant at the time of his election and installation had completed the eighth grade as prescribed in the public school system. Commonwealth by Dummit v. Mullins, 307<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc383" target="_blank">Ky. 383</a></cite>, 211 S.W.2d 133, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 741</cite> (Ky. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action brought by the Attorney General under this section, a decision that a person should be ousted from the physical occupancy of the office of member of the board of education because he never was eligible to hold the office, did not create a vacancy, but only directed that the person be ousted because there existed a vacancy, in law, in the position he was occupying, which vacancy occurred on the day the term began. Kash v. Day, 239 S.W.2d 959, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 917</cite> (Ky. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where in its complaint in ouster proceedings the Commonwealth alleged that the defendant had been duly elected and sworn in as a member of the county school board, there was no issue as to the authority by which the defendant held the office and the burden was on the plaintiff to show the claimed misconduct. Commonwealth ex rel. Matthews v. Combs, 426 S.W.2d 461, 1968<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 652</cite> (Ky. 1968).

        Where the office of county attorney is held by a usurper, and no other person is entitled thereto, an action to prevent the usurpation of the office can only be brought by the Commonwealth’s Attorney, therefore it cannot be brought by a private citizen even though the Commonwealth’s Attorney refuses to sue.

        An action brought by a Commonwealth’s Attorney, alleging that a member of the county board of education was a usurper of the office by reason of accepting free transportation from a railroad, was premature, because the statute providing forfeiture by an officer accepting a pass applied only after conviction for accepting the free pass.

       <p>
        A county school superintendent is not a county officer but a state officer and an action against him for usurpation of office cannot be brought against him by a Commonwealth’s Attorney but must be brought by the attorney general. Commonwealth ex rel. Baxter v. Burnett, 237<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 473</cite>, 35 S.W.2d 857, 1931<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 623</cite> (Ky. 1931).

        An action by a Commonwealth’s Attorney against an alleged usurper of the office of member of a county school board is subject to special demurrer because the Commonwealth’s Attorney does not have authority to maintain the action since a member of a county school board is not a county officer but a state officer.

      </p>
      <p>
       A candidate for the office of constable who, prior to the election, moved his legal residence outside of the magisterial district in which he was seeking office, no longer possessed the qualifications for office prescribed by Ky.

       A candidate for the office of coroner, who after being elected but before qualifying for office moved his legal residence from the magisterial district in which he was elected, would no longer possess the qualifications for office prescribed by Ky.

       Constables are required to live in the county from which they are elected pursuant to Ky. Const., §§ 99 and 100. If a person is elected constable and does not legally reside within the district from which he is elected, he would be subject to removal by the Commonwealth’s Attorney pursuant to this section. Once such person is removed, a vacancy is created which must be filled by the county court pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc63s63.220" target="_blank">63.220</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 70-157</cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       If a person is elected to the office of coroner without fulfilling the residence requirements, he would become a usurper subject to removal by the Commonwealth’s Attorney, but the failure to raise this question before his nomination in the primary precludes an opposing candidate or voter from questioning his qualifications thereafter.<cite class="OAG">OAG 73-686</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a magistrate is required to reside within his district, his removal from the district would subject him to removal proceedings instituted by the Commonwealth’s Attorney upon his being presented with sufficient evidence of nonresidency and the grounds that he was a usurper which could be presented by any citizen.<cite class="OAG">OAG 73-809</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a magistrate moves from and continues to live outside of the district in which he was elected he would be subject to an ouster action by the Commonwealth’s Attorney pursuant to this section.<cite class="OAG">OAG 74-691</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A de facto member of the fiscal court and usurper of the office may be removed by the Commonwealth’s Attorney pursuant to this section since no other person is claiming his office and, as long as he occupies the office, this action would be necessary to remove him.<cite class="OAG">OAG 75-26</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a county sheriff’s felony conviction is affirmed on appeal and the sheriff does not vacate the office, then the Commonwealth’s Attorney would have the duty to file an ouster action against him.<cite class="OAG">OAG 76-232</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a candidate for the office of constable properly filed notification and declaration papers in the district in which he resided, but after the books closed, and prior to the primary, he moved to another district and was subsequently nominated in his old district, he is the nominee since his qualifications were not challenged prior to the primary; however, if he won election he could be removed as a usurper pursuant to this section or, if he voluntarily resigned his nomination, his party could select someone to fill his place on the ballot pursuant to subsection (3) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.10.html#tXc118s118.105" target="_blank">118.105</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 81-223</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although “courtesy special deputies,” who are unsalaried deputies who aid the sheriff in discharging his statutory duties, are illegal, an ouster action under this section would not be the appropriate legal remedy to their activities, since they do not pretend to hold a legal office.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-105</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the literal wording of this section, the responsibility for removing a convicted felon from a county office is the Commonwealth’s Attorney of the county; the removal becomes necessary where such officer has received no pardon in terms of Ky. Const., § 150. Thus, if a former felon is elected to public office without having his civil rights restored, such person may be removed as a usurper pursuant to this section; since the jailer is a county office, the burden of instituting an ouster suit squarely falls on the Commonwealth’s Attorney.<cite class="OAG">OAG 83-393</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The position of executive director of the Office of the Ombudsman of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services is a “state office,” and one who holds that position is a “state officer,” such that one cannot hold that position and lawfully remain a member of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Council.<cite class="OAG">OAG 2006-02</cite>.

        An ouster proceeding under this section and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc415s415.040" target="_self">415.040</a></cite> must be brought by one who is entitled to the office by the Commonwealth’s Attorney if a county office is at stake, or by the Attorney General if a state office is at stake.

       <p>
        In deciding whether the Attorney General has authority to bring ouster proceedings for usurpation of a public office, it is the governmental level of the office, rather than the nature of the usurpation for which ouster is sought which is controlling and since county school board members are state officers it is clear that usurpation of the office is to be attacked through actions brought by the Attorney General under this section. Commonwealth ex rel. Buckman v. Mason, 284 S.W.2d 825, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 53</cite> (Ky. 1955).

        Courts should be slow to invoke estoppel against the state in its efforts to enforce a statute the purpose of which is to prevent “conflict of interest” situations and to prevent self-interest in the deliberation of public servants, and fact that county school board member was re-elected to a new term after the acts complained of did not “whitewash” him or furnish a defense.

       Under this section it is the duty of the Attorney General to institute ouster proceedings when a vacancy is created on a county board of education by the unexcused absence of a member from three consecutive meetings.<cite class="OAG">OAG 60-1135</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actions taken as a school board member after filing for nomination for the office of sheriff and thus disqualifying himself would be valid until the school board member resigned or was removed from office.<cite class="OAG">OAG 65-211</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Attorney General only is authorized to remove state and municipal officers for usurpation of office, i.e., where they are not qualified or where an act on their part constitutes by law a vacation of office.<cite class="OAG">OAG 67-146</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence submitted to the Attorney General considered sufficient to warrant authorization by the Attorney General to attorney representing citizens’ group to initiate ouster proceedings in the name of the Attorney General to remove a mayor from office for alleged violation of the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.270" target="_blank">61.270</a></cite> (now repealed) by reason of his alleged interest as a stockholder in a corporation holding the contract for collection and disposal of garbage within the city.<cite class="OAG">OAG 69-33</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A school board member is a legal member of the board until he resigns or is removed in an ouster action.<cite class="OAG">OAG 70-757</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actions of a duly elected police judge acting under color of legal title would be considered valid until an ouster proceeding is instituted challenging his statutory qualifications.<cite class="OAG">OAG 73-805</cite>; 73-816.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where candidate for police judge was duly elected by the people and took the oath of office knowing that he did not possess the qualifications for the office, the only remedy was an ouster action brought on relation of the Attorney General.<cite class="OAG">OAG 73-805</cite>; 73-816.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides the proper procedure for removal from office of a mayor who has ceased to qualify as such by reason of nonresidency.<cite class="OAG">OAG 74-402</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A motion to dismiss an action instituted by a citizen in the nature of an ouster proceeding was well taken, as only a claimant to the office or the Attorney General have the necessary standing to commence the action.<cite class="OAG">OAG 74-794</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power to authorize an ouster proceeding is purely discretionary with the Attorney General.<cite class="OAG">OAG 76-14</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Failing to meet the qualifications or doing that which is proscribed in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc160s160.180" target="_blank">160.180</a></cite> constitutes cause for consideration for removal of a board of education member from office for usurpation of that office by the Attorney General.<cite class="OAG">OAG 78-159</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Office of Attorney General, which has the sole responsibility and authority for bringing an ouster or quo warranto action against a school board member pursuant to this section, is not required to accept as conclusive any affidavits as to eighth grade completion which are provided pursuant to subdivision (1)(c) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc160s160.180" target="_blank">160.180</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-53</cite>.

Under this section and case law, documented evidence must be presented to the Attorney General for consideration and he has discretion in authorizing an ouster proceeding to be brought in his name by an attorney designated by the requesting party or parties.<cite class="OAG">OAG 83-467</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ouster proceedings may be taken by the Attorney General pursuant to this section and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXVIc415s415.060" target="_self">415.060</a></cite> against school board members who fail to obtain the required in-service training pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc160s160.180ol15" target="_blank">160.180(5)</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 85-145</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not prevent the Attorney General from having assistance of other counsel in cases that he brings when other counsel, with his consent, volunteer their services without any expense to the state.<cite class="OAG">OAG 90-141</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Persons who are ineligible to serve on school board should resign; however, unless a private citizen is claiming the office for himself, there is no proceeding short of an Attorney General ouster complaint which could prevent such individuals from taking the oath of office.<cite class="OAG">OAG 92-160</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where school board members were ineligible to serve on the board due to the employment of a relative by the school system and members refused to resign, the Office of the Attorney General could instigate ouster proceedings against them.<cite class="OAG">OAG 92-160</cite>.

        Where persons were elected to office of city commissioner in a void election, there being no such office, statutes regarding actions for usurpation of office were inapplicable as a defense to suit brought by mayor, administrative officers appointed by him, and a taxpayer, to restrain the elected commissioners from assuming the management of the city’s affairs.

        One who vacates the office of commissioner of a second-class city by the acceptance of an incompatible office of employment and then continues in possession of the first office is a usurper, and may be ousted at the suit of the person who is entitled to the office, but the individual seeking to recover it must show that he is lawfully entitled to the office.

        A judgment in ouster proceedings against deputy sheriff who had been indicted for murder was not void but only voidable where it had jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties, and if it committed error the only remedy was by an appeal from the judgment and not by mandatory writ to compel clerk to receive, accept and file his tendered supersedeas bond and to issue a supersedeas thereon.

        Before one may maintain an action to recover fees and emoluments of the office of manager of the workhouse of a county against an alleged usurper of the office he must allege and prove that he was entitled to the office during the time for which he is claiming the fees and emoluments.

       Where a regular deputy jailer continued to hold her office as a deputy jailer after accepting the office of city councilman, she became a usurper of the office of deputy jailer and the salary paid to her as deputy jailer out of the county treasury should be returned to the county from the beginning date of usurpation to the present. Thus, if she refuses to return the money the county can sue in circuit court to recover the compensation paid out of the county treasury while she has been a usurper; the parties defendant should include the usurper, the jailer, and the county treasurer, provided the proof shows that the jailer and county treasury issued salary checks to the usurper after knowing that she was a usurper, a mere de facto officer.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-25</cite>.
