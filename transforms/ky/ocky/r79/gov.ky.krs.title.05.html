       (6/25/2013). In subsection (24) of this statute, the list of KRS sections has been corrected. During the 2013 Regular Session of the General Assembly, the amendments to the Model State Code of Military Justice appeared in House Bill 362 and House Bill 167. The section numbers in these bills changed several times when alternative versions of the bills were introduced, but some of the internal references in subsection (24) of this statute ( 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 32, sec. 6) were inadvertently not corrected to correspond to those changes. Under the authority of
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11" target="_blank">7.136(1)</a></cite>, the Reviser of Statutes has corrected those references to match the list that appears in Article 1(a)(14) of the Model State Code of Military Justice.

       Subject matter jurisdiction is established if a nexus exists between an offense, either military or non-military, and the state military force. Courts-martial have primary jurisdiction of military offenses of this code. A proper civilian court has primary jurisdiction of a non-military offense when an act or omission violates both this code and local criminal law, foreign or domestic. In such a case, a court-martial may be initiated only after the civilian authority has declined to prosecute or dismissed the charge, provided jeopardy has not attached. Jurisdiction over attempted crimes, conspiracy crimes, solicitation, and accessory crimes must be determined by the underlying offense.

However, it is clear from examining earlier versions of this legislation drafted during the 2013 Regular Session of the General Assembly, and from a reading of Article 38 of the Uniform State Code of Military Justice, that a reference to Section 28 (KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tVc35s35.130" target="_self">35.130</a></cite>) was intended.

      Each rehearing under this code shall take place before a court-martial composed of members who were not members of the court-martial which first heard the case. Upon a rehearing the accused may not be tried for any offense of which the accused was found not guilty by the first court-martial, and no sentence in excess of or more severe than the original sentence may be approved, unless the sentence is based upon a finding of guilty of an offense not considered upon the merits in the original proceedings, or unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory. If the sentence approved after the first court-martial was in accordance with a pretrial agreement and the accused at the rehearing changes a plea with respect to the charges or specifications upon which the pretrial agreement was based, or otherwise does not comply with the pretrial agreement, the approved sentence as to those charges or specifications may include any punishment not in excess of that lawfully adjudged at the first court-martial.

       (7/15/2016). 2016 Ky. Acts ch. 75, sec. 6 provided that a new section of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tVc35" target="_self">Chapter 35</a></cite> was created to be numbered as KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tVc35s35.680" target="_self">35.680</a></cite>. However, a statute had previously been numbered as KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tVc35s35.680" target="_self">35.680</a></cite> when it was created in 1970 and then
    renumbered as KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tVc35s35.730" target="_self">35.730</a></cite> in 2013. Since the designation of “35.680” had been applied to an earlier statute and should not be assigned to a different statute because it would create confusion, the Reviser of Statutes has numbered 2016 Ky. Acts ch. 75, sec. 6 (this statute) as KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tVc35s35.679" target="_self">35.679</a></cite> instead under the authority of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11a" target="_blank">7.136(1)(a)</a></cite>.

The assessment of damages made by the board is subject to the approval of the commanding officer, and in the amount approved by that officer shall be charged against the pay of the offenders. The order of such commanding officer directing charges herein authorized is conclusive on any disbursing officer for the payment to the injured parties of the damages so assessed and approved.

       The Commonwealth of Kentucky recognizes the need to provide for honorable burials for Kentuckians who have served their state and nation in the Armed Forces. Historically these burial services have been conducted by the active military units in Kentucky, the Kentucky National Guard, the military reserves, and the veterans’ service organizations. However, increasing death rates, declining military resources, and an aging membership of veterans’ service organizations present the need for new initiatives in support of military burial honors.

        Law requiring counties where militia organizations were organized to construct and pay for armories was unconstitutional since it destroyed the equality of burdens for state purposes contrary to Const., § 171 and created an unjustifiable discrimination authorized by it.

     <p>
      The Governor may order any commissioned officer before an efficiency board consisting of three (3) officers senior in rank to the officer whose fitness for service is under examination. The board shall have the powers of courts of inquiry and courts-martial to subpoena witnesses and produce testimony and shall inquire into the moral character, capacity and general fitness of the commissioned officer. The board shall make a record of all proceedings. If the findings of the board are unfavorable to the officer and are approved by the Governor, he shall be discharged from the service. No officer shall participate in the examination or decision of the board in any case in which the decision would affect his own grade or promotion. Failure to appear when ordered before a board constituted under this section shall be sufficient grounds for a finding of the board that the officer ordered to appear be discharged.

     <p>
      The General Assembly realizes the Commonwealth is subject at all times to disaster or emergency occurrences which can range from crises affecting limited areas to widespread catastrophic events, and that response to these occurrences is a fundamental responsibility of elected government in the Commonwealth. It is the intent of the General Assembly to establish and to support a statewide comprehensive emergency management program for the Commonwealth, and through it an integrated emergency management system, in order to provide for adequate assessment and mitigation of, preparation for, response to, and recovery from, the threats to public safety and the harmful effects or destruction resulting from all major hazards, including but not limited to: flood, flash flood, tornado, blizzard, ice storm, snow storm, wind storm, hail storm, or other severe storms; drought, extremes of temperature, earthquake, landslides, or other natural hazards; fire, forest fire, or other conflagration; enemy attack, threats to public safety and health involving nuclear, chemical, or biological agents or weapons; sabotage, riot, civil disorder or acts of terrorism, and other domestic or national security emergencies; explosion, power failure or energy shortages, major utility system failure, dam failure, building collapse, other infrastructure failures; transportation-related emergencies on, over, or through the highways, railways, air, land, and waters in the Commonwealth; emergencies caused by spill or release of hazardous materials or substances; mass-casualty or mass-fatality emergencies; other technological, biological, etiological, radiological, environmental, industrial, or agricultural hazards; or other disaster or emergency occurrences; or catastrophe; or other causes; and the potential, threatened, or impending occurrence of any of these events; and in order to protect life and property of the people of the Commonwealth, and to protect public peace, health, safety, and welfare, and the environment; and in order to ensure the continuity and effectiveness of government in time of emergency, disaster, or catastrophe in the Commonwealth, it is hereby declared to be necessary:

     Rationale and purpose of program — Division of Emergency Management.
      </span>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly recognizes that the rationale and purpose of the comprehensive emergency management program of the Commonwealth has evolved from a program for response to threats to national security, enemy attack, and other national defense needs, to a program for response to all hazards, but primarily, domestic hazards and threats including natural, man-made, technological, industrial, or environmental emergencies or disasters, for which civil government is primarily responsible. Because of major changes in the rationale and necessity for emergency management capabilities, as well as the urgent requirement for multiagency participation and inter-agency coordination to ensure timely, effective, and appropriate disaster and emergency response in the Commonwealth, and to otherwise modernize and improve the administration, effectiveness, and relevance of the comprehensive emergency management program for the contemporary needs of the citizens of the Commonwealth, the General Assembly declares:
     </p>
     <ol>

       <span class="boldspan">
       </span>
       A Division of Emergency Management is hereby created as the emergency management agency of state government which shall develop the comprehensive emergency management program of the Commonwealth on behalf of the Governor, and in consultation with the cabinet secretaries of state government, other appropriate state agency heads, local elected chief executives, local emergency management directors, and local emergency planning committees, for the purpose of developing and enhancing comprehensive emergency management program policies, plans, or procedures to provide for a coordinated responsive, and integrated emergency management system in the Commonwealth;

     <p>
      This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this compact, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency disaster that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states’ National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.

     </h4>
     <p>
      Each party state entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.

     <p>
      The General Assembly shall by law provide for the issuance and sale of bonds of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the limitation of indebtedness in Section 49 or any other section of the Constitution of Kentucky, which shall be in addition to all other bonds of the Commonwealth heretofore authorized. The proceeds of such additional bonds, or so many thereof as may be necessary for the purpose, shall be used and appropriated solely for the purpose of paying a cash bonus not to exceed $500 for service outside the continental limits of the United States, and $300 for service in the continental limits of the United States to the veterans, their widows or heirs, or next of kin, of the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, and the Korean conflict, who were residents of the Commonwealth at the time of their entry into the service and at least six (6) months prior thereto. The General Assembly at the same session authorizing the issuance of the bonds shall levy a tax upon all retail sales at such a rate as will pay the interest upon and retire the bonds in no less than thirty (30) years, provided that retail sales of food and food products, medicines, and clothing may be exempted from such tax.

        Veterans’ bonus legislation does not violate the federal Constitution or the Kentucky Constitution since the status of the veteran is not that of a soldier in the United States army but that of a Kentucky citizen whom the legislature and the people deem proper to recognize because of his past service, and the bonus is reimbursement to such Kentuckians for losses suffered by reason of military service and has nothing whatever to do with raising or supporting armies. Stovall v. Gartrell, 332 S.W.2d 256, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 141</cite> (Ky. 1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        The payment of money to those in a certain class for a recognizable public purpose does not violate either Const., §§ 3 or 171 and the designation of veterans as distinguished from those who did not serve is a reasonable classification. Stovall v. Gartrell, 332 S.W.2d 256, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 141</cite> (Ky. 1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of Acts 1958, ch. 48 to the effect that it provided for the retirement of the bonds in “not more than thirty years” violated Const., § 50 wherein it is provided that bonds shall be retired “within 30 years”; however, since it was not materially substantial on the question of exceeding the debt limitation, this invalid provision could not be held to nullify the enactment or the vote of the people. Stovall v. Gartrell, 332 S.W.2d 256, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 141</cite> (Ky. 1960).
       </p>

        The payment of a bonus to a veteran for past services serves a reasonable public purpose not in violation of the federal Constitution or of the Kentucky Constitution. Stovall v.

        Acts 1958, ch. 48 which was designated a constitutional amendment was held to contain legislative matters and not matter properly belonging in the Constitution. Stovall v. Gartrell, 332 S.W.2d 256, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 141</cite> (Ky. 1960).

       <p>
        The votes of veteran members of the legislature on a veterans’ bonus were not void since the legislation presented involved a broad classification of a substantial segment of the public and although veterans in the legislature might anticipate that someday they would benefit from the legislation, such benefits were not private or personal, but were benefits to be received as members of a class. Stovall v. Gartrell, 332 S.W.2d 256, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 141</cite> (Ky. 1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where title to Acts 1958, ch. 48 provided for a bonus to veterans and the question framed by the legislature and presented to the people referred to a “bonus to veterans” the words “their widows or heirs, or next of kin” added to the act by way of amendment were considered surplusage since this classification was beyond the scope of “veterans” and the people were not deemed to have given their approval beyond the classification of veterans. Stovall v. Gartrell, 332 S.W.2d 256, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 141</cite> (Ky. 1960).

       It was the intention of the legislature that all beneficiaries entitled to a bonus should receive their share thereof, but that where the veterans’ division makes a determination as to the validity of a claim, though later found to be erroneous, and makes a conscientious though unsuccessful effort to recover an erroneous overpayment of a bonus, no additional funds can be paid out to other qualified beneficiaries.<cite class="OAG">OAG 62-997</cite>.

        Plaintiff’s claim that Kentucky bonus law was repugnant to Constitution of Kentucky and Constitution of United States on ground that congress under exclusive power to enact laws relating to veterans’ benefits had pre-empted the field and that at some future date he might be required to pay a tax to sustain the purposes of the statute did not present a justiciable controversy within the meaning of the declaratory judgment law as plaintiff did not show that he would suffer some direct injury or that there was a threat that he might suffer such injury. Grise v. Combs, 183 F. Supp. 705, 1960 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5142 (E.D.<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 1960</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Law authorizing payment of a veteran’s bonus was constitutional since the military is a public service for which a grant of separate emoluments may be made under Const., § 3 and since the granting of the bonus to person who had been a resident of the state for six months before he entered the armed forces and was a resident of the state on the date the electorate approved the bonus proposal formed a proper integral classification.

        The General Assembly did not act unreasonably in generally classifying or confining “qualified veterans” to receive bonus payments to those who were residents of the Commonwealth for at least six months before entering the armed services and who were residents on November 3, 1959, the date the electorate approved the bonus proposal.

       <p>
        The part of this section which attempts to provide for payment of benefits to nonresident veterans “who reside in an incorporated town part of which lies in Kentucky * * *” is invalid to that extent, because residency is the essential element for qualification of a veteran under the present legislation.

       The Commonwealth of Kentucky recognizes the vast majority of honorable burials for Kentuckians who have served their state and nation in the Armed Forces are conducted by the veterans’ service organizations. The active military units in Kentucky, the Kentucky National Guard, and the military reserves are providing burial honors details as available manpower permits. Year 2000 data from the Department of Defense shows over 497,000 veterans died, but only 91,074 military funeral honors were performed. Although the veterans’ service organizations provide untold thousands of unofficial services, many Kentucky veterans are still being buried without honors, including firing details, color guard, and pallbearers.
