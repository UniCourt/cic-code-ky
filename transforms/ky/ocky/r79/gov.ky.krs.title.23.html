        It was not necessary that the agent reside at the place of business; nor that he be present at such place of business at all times. It was sufficient that he be at such place of business or in the county, at all reasonable times, and not be unnecessarily absent for unreasonable lengths of time. Paducah Cooperage Co. v. Commonwealth, 122 Ky. 755, 93 S.W. 12, 29 Ky. L. Rptr. 304, 1906 Ky. LEXIS 100 (Ky. 1906) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person designated by the statement as process agent remained such until a new statement was filed although he had ceased to be an agent in fact. American Patriots v. Kinkead, 144 Ky. 662, 139 S.W. 834, 1911 Ky. LEXIS 690 (Ky. 1911) (decided under prior law); S. B. Reese Lumber Co. v. Licking Coal & Lumber Co., 156 Ky. 723, 161 S.W. 1124, 1914 Ky. LEXIS 186 (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        A process agent was not empowered to waive service of summons and enter his principal’s appearance, especially when antagonistic interests had developed between them. King Const. Co. v. Mary Helen Coal Corp., 194 Ky. 435, 239 S.W. 799, 1922 Ky. LEXIS 184 (Ky. 1922) (decided under prior law).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A penal action to recover a fine for violation of former section requiring registered office and agent must be brought in the county where the corporation conducts its business. Kentucky Straight Creek Coal Co. v. Commonwealth, 304 Ky. 247, 200 S.W.2d 470, 1947 Ky. LEXIS 622 (Ky. 1947) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where service was made on registered office and agent maintained as required by former similar section, the complaint could not be dismissed for lack of venue under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.42.html#tXXXXIIc452s452.450" target="_blank">452.450</a></cite> since that section only refers to “an” office or place of business rather than the chief place of business. Kem Mfg. Corp. v. Kentucky Gem Coal Co., 610 S.W.2d 913, 1980 Ky. App. LEXIS 407 (Ky. Ct. App. 1980) (decided under prior law).

Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear in conflict, therefore, they have been codified together.

        A corporation was liable for paying dividends to the record owner of stock where the only other person who had ever claimed any right to the stock had relinquished such right by a formal assignment to the record owner, duly made and exhibited to the proper officers of the corporation. Greasy Brush Coal Co. v. Hays, 292 Ky. 517, 166 S.W.2d 983, 1942 Ky. LEXIS 115 (Ky. 1942) (decided under prior law).

        A corporation owed a duty to its stockholders to exercise reasonable diligence, in every case where notice of any infirmity in the holder’s title had been brought to it, to ascertain whether or not a requested transfer of the stock was duly authorized to be made. Kentucky Utilities Co. v. Skaggs, 293 Ky. 622, 169 S.W.2d 809, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 670 (Ky. 1943) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        A corporation was justified in refusing to transfer stock of one of its stockholders where it was put on notice of his mental condition and the facts were such as to raise a reasonable doubt of his mental capacity to transact business. Kentucky Utilities Co. v. Skaggs, 293 Ky. 622, 169 S.W.2d 809, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 670 (Ky. 1943) (decided under prior law).

        Home owners’
    fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation claims and a declaratory judgment claim against a construction company’s shareholders would not be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on the ground that the shareholders could not be personally liable under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.6" target="_blank">271B.6</a></cite>-220(2) because the alleged misrepresentations were acts of the company, as the owners sufficiently alleged that the acts were the acts of the shareholders and not the company. Although the argument of the company and the shareholders might ultimately prevail, the court could only consider the facts as alleged in the complaint on a motion to dismiss. Schejbal v.

        Where the one owner continued to reach agreements with the construction company that was owed money by one owner’s administratively dissolved corporation, in the years after the money was owed, the one owner could not show that the one owner was not personally liable for the agreement the one owner made to guarantee the construction company payment in return for the construction company executing a lien waiver, which was an agreement the one owner did not fully perform.

       <p>
        Husband and wife who owned and operated a Kentucky oil and gas drilling company were ordered to pay investors $5,662,662 in compensatory damages plus prejudgment interest because they committed fraud, breach of contract, and conversion when they made misrepresentations that induced an elderly investor, members of his family, and family trusts to invest in nonexistent and worthless gas wells, and the debt was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523. The court found that the husband and wife were personally liable for the fact that the company breached contracts with the investors because the company was the husband and wife’s alter ego and piercing the corporate veil was necessary to prevent the husband and wife from perpetuating a fraud and committing other illegal acts in the name of the company and then avoiding responsibility by hiding behind the corporate shield; the company did not maintain permanent corporate records, as required by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.16" target="_blank">271B.16</a></cite>-010, and the husband and wife transferred significant amounts of money from the company to their personal bank accounts and used the money to pay personal expenses.

        Unpublished decision:
    District court erred when it found that a shareholder could not be personally liable for conversion where the proceeds of a sale of equipment that secured creditor’s loan were used to pay off another creditor because the proceeds were maintained in the corporation’s account. Under Kentucky law, if the shareholder was responsible for the transfer of funds to pay off the other creditor and was acting on behalf of the corporation, he could be personally liable for the tort of conversion.

        Shareholders generally have no individual liability, they purchase shares for consideration, and in return, they have a right to vote those shares; if they do not own the majority of the shares, they should recognize that they may be outvoted.

        Tools of good corporate practice are designed to give a purchasing minority shareholder the opportunity to bargain for protection before parting with consideration; it would do violence to normal corporate practice and the corporation law to impose a duty on the majority to vote their shares in the minority's interests as opposed to their interests.

        Where a minority stockholder wanted the debts of the president of the corporation to the corporation to be collected and wanted the arrangement set aside under which they were to be paid, the remedy by which it could be accomplished without a receiver was through a stockholder’s derivative suit in the name of the corporation.

        The trial court’s findings of good faith, reasonableness and independence on the part of the corporation’s special litigation committees would be upheld where (1) directors did not serve on committees investigating entities in which they had a direct interest, (2) the board hired independent counsel to investigate and assist the committees, (3) counsel expended over 1,100 hours investigating the plaintiff’s charges at a cost exceeding $129,000, (4) the board also hired accountants who investigated the specific complaints and sampled transactions going back twelve (12) years.

        The trial court properly found that the plaintiff was not a suitable representation to prosecute the action where he stated during his deposition that he would have the auditor review every financial record from the very beginning of the corporation that was available and that he would not place any cost controls or budgets on the investigation of the litigation. Allied Ready Mix Co. v. Allen, 994 S.W.2d 4, 1998 Ky. App. LEXIS 146 (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Shareholder’s appeal of the dismissal of his derivative action was dismissed because, during the pendency of the appeal, as the result of a merger, the shareholder’s stock in the corporation was cancelled; derivative actions required plaintiffs to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the stockholders, and continuous ownership of stock was required. Further, the right to continue any pending derivative lawsuits would have passed from the former stockholders to the surviving corporation. Bacigalupo v. Kohlhepp, 240 S.W.3d 155, 2007 Ky. App. LEXIS 454 (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the shareholder fairly and adequately represented the interests of the shareholders where she was the only shareholder available to pursue claims on behalf of the other shareholders.

        Trial court did not err by dismissing a derivative shareholder action, because appellant’s self-interest and lack of support from the other shareholders deprived him of standing to pursue a derivative claim under

       <p>
        Upon the dismissal of a shareholder derivative action filed against appellees, the chairman of a corporation, its president, and majority shareholder, for selling a shopping mall for an allegedly inadequate price, the trial court did not err by refusing to award appellees attorney fees under
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.7" target="_blank">271B.7</a></cite>-400(4). Because the facts surrounding the sale and re-sale of the mall gave appellant a reasonable basis to question the sale, appellee did not commence the proceeding without reasonable cause. Watkins v.

        The discretion and acts of the board of directors were conclusively deemed to be those of the corporation unless such acts were ultra vires, fraudulent or constitute a breach of trust. Pittsburg, C., C. & S. L. R. Co. v. Dodd, 115 Ky. 176, 72 S.W. 822, 1903 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 1903) (decided under prior law).

        The management of a corporation’s affairs, involving exercise of judgment and policy, was by law committed to the board of directors. Pittsburg, C., C. & S. L. R. Co. v. Dodd, 115 Ky. 176, 72 S.W. 822, 1903 Ky. LEXIS 88 (Ky. 1903); Caddy Oil Co. v. Sommer, 186 Ky. 843, 218 S.W. 288, 1920 Ky. LEXIS 41 (Ky. 1920) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        The action of directors when exercised in good faith and not in fraud of the rights of stockholders was not subject to their control and would not be interfered with by the courts. Taylor v. Axton-Fisher Tobacco Co., 295 Ky. 226, 173 S.W.2d 377, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 189 (Ky. 1943) (decided under prior law).

        Directors could not vote by proxy. Haldeman v. Haldeman, 176 Ky. 635, 197 S.W. 376, 1917 Ky. LEXIS 95 (Ky. 1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        An individual director had no authority as such. He could only act as agent by appointment, like other agents were appointed. Directors had to act together as a board; the separate assent of a majority was not binding on the corporation. Haldeman v. Haldeman, 176 Ky. 635, 197 S.W. 376, 1917 Ky. LEXIS 95 (Ky. 1917); Caddy Oil Co. v. Sommer, 186 Ky. 843, 218 S.W. 288, 1920 Ky. LEXIS 41 (Ky. 1920); Paducah Newspapers, Inc. v. Goodman, 251 Ky. 754, 65 S.W.2d 990, 1933 Ky.

        The directors could confer authority upon the corporate officers and ratify unauthorized acts of such officers. Caddy Oil Co. v. Sommer, 186 Ky. 843, 218 S.W. 288, 1920 Ky. LEXIS 41 (Ky. 1920) (decided under prior law). See also Paducah Newspapers, Inc. v. Goodman, 251 Ky. 754, 65 S.W.2d 990, 1933 Ky. LEXIS 944 (Ky. 1933) (decided under prior law).

For claims alleging breach of a director’s fiduciary duties, especially the duty of loyalty, in the context of preparation for and participation in a competing enterprise, the common law principles elucidated in case law continue to apply.

        Kentucky has adopted the principle that informed shareholders could validate transactions which might otherwise be subject to attack due to director self-interest; this section did add, however, the requirement that the transaction must not be “manifestly unfair” to the corporation. Nelson v. Gammon, 478 F. Supp. 630, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10010 (W.D. Ky. 1979), aff’d, 647 F.2d 710, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 13523 (6th Cir. 1981) (decided under prior law).

        Judgment which did not award damages based on a managing member’s breach of fiduciary duty to a limited liability company (LLC) was error because, regardless of the LLC’s ability to complete projects diverted to another company formed by the managing member, the managing member could have and should have informed the other LLC members, and this conduct violated KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIIc275s275.170" target="_self">275.170</a></cite>; KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.8" target="_blank">271B.8</a></cite>-310(1) was illustrative of Kentucky law regarding the primacy of fiduciary duty over misappropriation of corporate opportunity.

        Statute, which concerned director conflicts of interest, provided no support for the corporation's argument that it was capable of filing suit on its own behalf; the statute merely delineates transactions that are voidable by the corporation, and nothing in the statute requires a corporation to directly exercise that right, or alters the manner in which a corporation decides to exercise and vindicate such a right, and nothing in the statute disqualifies any director, self-interested or otherwise, from voting against the corporation exercising such a right.

        Claim alleging a violation of this statute was subject to dismissal because the statute did not provide an individual cause of action for the debtor as a shareholder or director and thus the debtor lacked standing to assert a direct claim against plaintiff creditor under the statute.

In the absence of Kentucky statutory authority governing a corporate officer’s conflicts of interest, Kentucky common law—in the instant case, Aero Drapery of Ky. Inc. v. Engdahl, 507 S.W.2d 166, 1974 Ky. LEXIS 671 (Ky. 1974), and its progeny—governed; therefore, defendant’s argument that, pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.8" target="_blank">271B.8</a></cite>-310(1), the transactions between companies in which he had a secret interest and plaintiff needed only to be “fair” to waive his conflicts of interest was not well taken.

       <p>
        In setting “fair value” pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.13" target="_blank">271B.13</a></cite>-010, the trial court erred in applying a 20 percent marketability discount, absent exceptional circumstances, which made it possible for majority shareholders to squeeze-out a minority shareholder at a price considerably less than the minority shareholder’s proportionate interest in the closely-held family corporation as a whole. Brooks v. Brooks Furniture Mfgrs, Inc., 325 S.W.3d 904, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 207 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010), overruled in part, Shawnee Telecom Res., Inc. v. Brown, 354 S.W.3d 542, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 159 (Ky. 2011).

       <p>
        In appraising a dissenter’s shares pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.13" target="_blank">271B.13</a></cite>-300 following a cash-out merger, a marketability discount was inappropriate at the shareholder level in determining fair value as defined in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.13" target="_blank">271B.13</a></cite>-010(3), and and use of the Delaware block appraisal method was not necessary. Net asset value could be considered on remand, and an entity-level discount would be permissible. Shawnee Telecom Res., Inc. v. Brown, 354 S.W.3d 542, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 159 (Ky. 2011)(Overruling to the extent inconsistent: Ford v. Courier-Journal Job Printing Co., 639 S.W.2d 553, 1982 Ky. App. LEXIS 251 (Ky. Ct. App. 1982), overruled in part, Brooks v. Brooks Furniture Mfgrs, Inc., 325 S.W.3d 904, 2010 Ky. App. LEXIS 207 (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a hypothetical market price for the dissenter’s particular shares as a commodity is not the value being sought in an appraisal proceeding under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.13" target="_blank">271B.13</a></cite>-300, market adjustments to arrive at such a price, such as discounts for lack of control or lack of marketability, are inappropriate in determining fair value as defined in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.13" target="_blank">271B.13</a></cite>-010(3). The dissenting shareholder is entitled to the fair value of his or her shares as measured by the proportionate interest those shares represent in the value of the company as a going concern, a value determined in accord with generally accepted valuation concepts and techniques, as to which the Delaware block approach is not required. Shawnee Telecom Res., Inc. v. Brown, 354 S.W.3d 542, 2011 Ky. LEXIS 159 (Ky. 2011)(Overruling to the extent inconsistent: Ford v. Courier-Journal Job Printing Co., 639 S.W.2d 553, 1982 Ky.

       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its discretion in adding an award of interest of eight percent (8%) to the judgment in favor of the stockholders who dissented from a sale of corporate assets where the evidence showed that the purchasing corporation would pay between six (6) and nine (9) percent interest on the purchase price and that an award of eight percent would be fair and equitable under the totality of the circumstances.

        Although the Legislature intended, as a general rule, that the appraisal remedy provided for in former statute was the only remedy for a dissenting stockholder in the case of a merger, it did not appear likely that it intended dissenting stockholders to be so limited where a merger was being effected in contravention of law, or where some species of fraud was being worked upon the dissenters.

        Dissolved corporate entity may not carry on any business other than winding up and liquidating its business and affairs, and thus, in a case involving enforcement of a restrictive covenant, the property owners’ argument that the original corporate developer, which had since been dissolved, was the only entity with approval authority over their proposed garage was without merit. Colliver v. Stonewall Equestrian Estates Ass'n, 139 S.W.3d 521, 2003 Ky. App. LEXIS 307 (Ky. Ct. App. 2003).

        The language of former law barring claims not commenced within two (2) years after the date of dissolution applied only to claims which arose “prior” to dissolution; accordingly, former law could not be applied to bar a plaintiff’s claim that a corporation’s majority shareholder, its accountants, and its attorney were negligent in liquidating the corporation’s assets and, consequently, that the corporation was required to pay additional taxes, penalties, lawyer’s fees, and accountant’s fees, since such a claim could not have arisen until after dissolution and the winding-up period. Gross v. Hougland, 712 F.2d 1034, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 25908 (6th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1025, 104 S. Ct. 1281, 79 L. Ed. 2d 684, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 1087 (1984) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The stockholders, at the time the corporation became extinct for all purposes, including the two-year period allowed by former section for the winding up of its business, acquired the title to and became the owners of the judgment in favor of the corporation for deficiency in a mortgage foreclosure suit. Levy v. Liebling, 238 F.2d 505, 1956 U.S. App. LEXIS 4427 (6th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 936, 77 S. Ct. 812, 1 L. Ed. 2d 759, 1957 U.S. LEXIS 1040 (1957) (decided under prior law).

        Where national steeplechase association driver transported steeplechase jumps to Kentucky, but did not assist local agency in setting them up, and where association’s employes occasionally acted as stewards in race meetings, such meetings each being held three (3) or four (4) days each calendar year, these activities together were isolated transactions so as to fall under exception contained in former statute for interstate commerce and thus association was not required to obtain a certificate of authority as a foreign business transacting business in Kentucky. Commonwealth ex rel. Stephens v. National Steeplechase & Hunt Asso., 612 S.W.2d 347, 1981 Ky. App. LEXIS 220 (Ky. Ct. App. 1981) (decided under prior law).

        Husband and wife who owned and operated a Kentucky oil and gas drilling company were ordered to pay investors $5,662,662 in compensatory damages plus prejudgment interest because they committed fraud, breach of contract, and conversion when they made misrepresentations that induced an elderly investor, members of his family, and family trusts to invest in nonexistent and worthless gas wells, and the debt was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523. The court found that the husband and wife were personally liable for the fact that the company breached contracts with the investors because the company was the husband and wife’s alter ego and piercing the corporate veil was necessary to prevent the husband and wife from perpetuating a fraud and committing other illegal acts in the name of the company and then avoiding responsibility by hiding behind the corporate shield; the company did not maintain permanent corporate records, as required by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.16" target="_blank">271B.16</a></cite>-010, and the husband and wife transferred significant amounts of money from the company to their personal bank accounts and used the money to pay personal expenses.

        In action by minority shareholder of family business to inspect the books and records of a corporation under subsection (2) of this section, evidence that shareholder’s father had transferred 90 shares to each of his three children and shareholder had transferred her shares back to her father, that she had another action pending to recover these shares and in which she seeks to enjoin corporation from paying dividends on these shares until their ownership is determined, that she had received 14 shares upon distribution of her father’s estate, that she had transferred two (2) shares to each of her six (6) children, that prior to the transfer stockholder’s brother, the secretary-treasurer of the corporation, had advised her that such transfer would cause the corporation to lose its right to file federal tax reports under Subchapter S, that the children of shareholder’s brothers have shares of stock in the corporation, that although shareholder’s husband stated that he would spend $2,000,000 in an effort to destroy the corporation there was no evidence showing that husband had legal control over wife’s stock, nor that he controlled her or her demands and fact that husband was engaged in competition with the corporation was irrelevant to wife’s request, sustained finding that corporation had not met its burden that action for inspection was for an improper purpose.

        While a shareholder could examine the books only for a proper corporate purpose, an intent to destroy a corporation, to bring vexatious suits, or to take unfair advantage for competitive reasons was not considered a proper corporate purpose and denial of access to the books on any of these grounds would be justified.

      An association may provide in its bylaws for one or more regular meetings each year. Special meetings of the members of the association may be called by the board; it shall be the board’s duty to call such meetings when ten percent (10%) of the members of the association file with the association secretary a petition demanding a special meeting and specifying the business to be considered at such meeting. Regular or special meetings may be held within or without the state. Notice of all meetings, except as otherwise provided by law or in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, shall be mailed to each member at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, and in case of special meetings the notice shall state the purposes for which it is called, but the bylaws may provide that all notices, except of proposed amendments to the articles of incorporation, may be given by publication in a periodical or newsletter published by or for the association of which substantially all its members are recipients, or in newspapers whose combined circulation is general in the territory in which the association operates.

Within twenty (20) days after the date on which the vote was taken, such member may, unless he votes in favor of the proposal, make written demand on the association for payment of the fair market value of his stock or other property rights or interest in the association. Such demands shall state the number and class of shares of stock owned by him or the nature and amount of other property rights or interest owned by him in the association. In addition to any other right he may have in law or equity, a member giving such notice shall be entitled, if and when the merger or consolidation is effected, to be paid by the surviving association, or new association, the fair market value of such stock, or other property rights or interests, as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken, subject only to the surrender by him of the certificate, or certificates of such stock or other evidence of ownership or other property rights or interests.

       If within thirty (30) days after the date upon which the objecting member tendered his written demand for payment of his stock or other property rights or interest, the fair market value of such stock or other property rights or interests is agreed upon between the member and the surviving association, the payment therefor shall be made within sixty (60) days after the date of such agreement, upon surrender of the certificate or other evidence of such property rights or interests, whereupon the member shall cease to have any interest in such stock or other property rights or interest in the association.

       If, during the thirty (30) day period mentioned in the preceding subsection, the member and the surviving association or new association do not agree as to the fair market value of such stock or other property rights or interests, the member may, within sixty (60) days thereafter, file a petition in the Circuit Court of the county in which the surviving association or new association has its registered office or principal place of business asking for the appointment of three (3) disinterested appraisers to appraise the fair market value of his stock or other property rights or interests. A summons, together with a copy of the petition, shall be served on the surviving association or new association at least twenty (20) days prior to a hearing on the petition by the court. The award of the appraisers, or a majority of them, if no exceptions be filed thereto within ten (10) days after the award has been filed in court, shall be confirmed by the court, and when confirmed shall be final and conclusive, and the member, upon depositing with the court the proper stock certificates or other evidence of such property rights or interests, shall be entitled to judgment against the association for the appraised value thereof as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken. If either party files exceptions to the award of the appraisers within ten (10) days after the award has been filed in court, the case shall be transferred to the civil issue docket of the Circuit Court for trial and shall be there tried in the same manner, as near as may be practicable, as is provided for the trial of cases under the eminent domain law of this state, and with the same right of appeal to the Court of Appeals. The court shall assess the cost of the proceedings as it deems equitable. Upon payment of the judgment, the surviving association or new association is entitled to have the member’s stock certificates or other evidence of such property rights or interests surrendered to it by the clerk of the court. Unless the member files such a petition within the time prescribed, he, his assigns and heirs claiming under him shall have no right to payment hereunder, but in that event nothing herein shall impair his status as a member.

The board of directors shall have the right to call a special meeting at any time; and ten percent (10%) of the members may file a petition stating the specific business to be brought before the association and demand a special meeting at any time. Such meeting must thereupon be called by the directors. Notice of all meetings, together with a statement of the purposes thereof, shall be mailed to each member at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that the bylaws may require instead that such notice may be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation, published at the principal place of business of the association.

       The affairs of the association shall be managed by a board of not less than five (5) directors, elected by the members from their own number. The bylaws may provide that the territory in which the association has members shall be divided into districts and that the directors shall be elected according to such districts, either directly or by district delegates elected by the members in that district. In such a case the bylaws shall specify the number of directors to be elected by each district, the manner and method of reapportioning the directors and of redistricting the territory covered by the association. The bylaws may provide that primary elections shall be held in each district to elect the directors apportioned to such districts and that the result of all such primary elections may be ratified by the next regular meeting of the association or may be considered final as to the association. The bylaws may provide that one or more directors may be appointed by any public official or commission or by the other directors selected by the members or their delegates. Such directors shall represent primarily the interest of the general public in such associations. The director or directors so appointed need not be members of the association, but shall have the same powers and rights as other directors. Such directors shall not number more than one-fifth (1/5) of the entire number of directors.

LEXIS 118 (Ky. 1838). See Shannon v. Frost, 42 Ky. 253, 1842 Ky. LEXIS 151 (Ky. 1842); Gartin v. Penick, 68 Ky. 110, 1868 Ky. LEXIS 236 (Ky. 1868); Kinkead v. McKee, 72 Ky. 535, 1872 Ky. LEXIS 81 (Ky. 1872); First Presbyterian Church v. Wilson, 77 Ky. 525 (1878); Ransom v. Rogers, 12 Ky. Op. 739, 6 Ky. L. Rptr. 291, 1884 Ky. LEXIS 325 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 1884) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The courts, having no ecclesiastical jurisdiction, cannot revise or question ordinary acts of church discipline or excision. Shannon v. Frost, 42 Ky. 253, 1842 Ky. LEXIS 151 (Ky. 1842); Gibson v. Armstrong, 46 Ky. 481, 1847 Ky. LEXIS 63 (Ky. 1847); Gartin v. Penick, 68 Ky. 110, 1868 Ky. LEXIS 236 (Ky. 1868); Lucas v. Case, 72 Ky. 297, 1872 Ky. LEXIS 49 (Ky. 1872); Kinkead v. McKee, 72 Ky. 535, 1872 Ky. LEXIS 81 (Ky. 1872) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the ecclesiastical tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction, the secular courts will review the question of jurisdiction. Watson v. Avery, 65 Ky. 332, 1867 Ky. LEXIS 87 (Ky. 1867); Perry v. Wheeler, 75 Ky. 541, 1877 Ky. LEXIS 116 (Ky. 1877) (decided under prior law).

     </h3>
     <p>
      In case of a division in a religious society, the trustees shall permit each party to use the church and property for divine worship a part of the time, proportioned to the members of each party. The excommunication of one (1) party by the other shall not impair this right unless it is done in good faith, on the grounds of immorality.

       <p>
        When a division exists in the denominational type of church property rights will be adjudged in favor of that faction which is recognized by the highest ecclesiastical court, though such faction be a minority. Gibson v. Armstrong, 46 Ky. 481, 1847 Ky. LEXIS 63 (Ky. 1847); Humphrey v. Burnside, 67 Ky. 215, 1868 Ky. LEXIS 108 (Ky. 1868); Lewis v. Watson, 67 Ky. 228, 1868 Ky. LEXIS 109 (Ky. 1868); McKinney v.

        In a church of the denominational type a seceding majority who purport to organize or join a separate organization forfeit their rights in the property of their former church. Harper v. Straws, 53 Ky. 48 (Ky. 1853); Lewis v. Watson, 67 Ky. 228, 1868 Ky. LEXIS 109 (Ky. 1868); McKinney v. Griggs, 68 Ky. 401, 1869 Ky. LEXIS 25 (Ky. 1869); Brown v. Monroe, 80 Ky. 443, 4 Ky. L.

       <p>
        Where majority of church members expelled minority from membership and by the terms of the church organization the majority had control of the church the minority lost all rights in the property of the church.

       </p>
       <p>
        In the presbyterian type of church in the case of division or controversy, control of the property of the church will be given by the courts to those persons or members of the congregation who are recognized by the highest ecclesiastical court or judicatory of the denomination as being the church or congregation, even though they constitute but a minority of the congregation. Poynter v. Phelps, 129 Ky. 381, 111 S.W. 699, 33 Ky. L. Rptr. 887, 1908 Ky. LEXIS 167 (Ky. 1908); Bogard v. Boone, 200 Ky. 572, 255 S.W. 112, 1923 Ky. LEXIS 130 (Ky. 1923).

       <p>
        Where a division and complete separation exists in the congregational type of church property rights will be adjudged in favor of the larger faction, even when that faction has changed its religious views, unless the property is subject to a specific trust in favor of the original religious beliefs. Poynter v. Phelps, 129 Ky. 381, 111 S.W. 699, 33 Ky. L. Rptr. 887, 1908 Ky. LEXIS 167 (Ky. 1908); Cox v. Prewitt, 197 Ky. 716, 247 S.W. 976, 1923 Ky. LEXIS 711 (Ky. 1923); Bogard v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Attempted judgment of ecclesiastical presbytery of Baptist association ousting minister and his followers from use of church property and declaring opposing faction entitled to property was void, where association had no authority by its constitution to adjudge matters relating to internal affairs of churches in its membership. Vaughan v. Maynard, 294 Ky. 38, 170 S.W.2d 897, 1943 Ky. LEXIS 377 (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        A church having the congregational form of government, in the sense that it does not recognize an ecclesiastical authority above the local church, an adherence to the belief that the members have a right to vote in church affairs cannot be considered a departure from fundamental doctrine within the meaning of the rule that a majority will forfeit its property rights by departing from the fundamental doctrines of the church. Bunnell v. Creacy, 266 S.W.2d 98, 1954 Ky. LEXIS 779 (Ky. 1954).

        When the statute does not apply a seceding faction which has expended money to improve the church building is entitled to a lien or the use and enjoyment of the building for a proper proportion of the time until reimbursement is made. Hadden v. Chorn, 47 Ky. 70, 1847 Ky. LEXIS 121 (Ky. 1847); Harper v. Straws, 53 Ky. 48 (Ky. 1853) (decided under prior law).

        An allegation that the church expelled certain members is sufficient, provided it was done by the church as a body, at its regular time of meeting, whether the church rules required a concurrence of all or only a majority. Berryman v. Reese, 50 Ky. 287, 1850 Ky. LEXIS 58 (Ky. 1850) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        “Immorality” is such conduct as contravenes the moral or divine law; that amounts to dishonesty, wickedness or injustice; not a mere refusal by a minority to obey the majority or subscribe to its beliefs in all details. Ransom v. Rogers, 12 Ky. Op. 739, 6 Ky. L. Rptr. 291, 1884 Ky. LEXIS 325 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 1884) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the courts have no power to review excommunications, nevertheless they may determine whether the act was that of the church or of persons who were not the church, and in a church of the congregational type, a majority adhering to the organization and doctrines of the church represent the church, and cannot be expelled by a minority of those present.

        This section provides a method by which title to property in which a charitable trust is invested may be conveyed which could otherwise not be done because of limitations or restrictions that the donor or grantor may enforce, and reinvested the same in a manner consistent with the purposes and objects of the trust.

       There is no authority for the county judge/executive or fiscal court to prohibit or limit a volunteer fire department operating in the unincorporated part of a county, except that the fiscal court may enact ordinances pertaining to the reasonable regulation of such volunteer fire departments, pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.083ol13" target="_blank">67.083(3)</a></cite> (u).

       There is no authority of the county judge/executive or fiscal court to prohibit or limit rescue squads operating in the unincorporated portion of a county, except that the fiscal court, under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.083" target="_blank">67.083</a></cite> (3) (d), has express authority to enact ordinances regarding the reasonable regulation of ambulance service in the unincorporated part of the county.

       A county public hospital corporation which is formed as a nonprofit, nonstock corporation pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIIc273" target="_self">Chapter 273</a></cite> is not a public agency which is subject to the Open Meeting Law ( KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.805" target="_blank">61.805</a></cite> —<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.850" target="_blank">61.850)</a></cite>. OAG 82-1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a county public hospital corporation being a corporation is not a public agency subject to the provisions of the statutes pertaining to conflict of interest, there is no statutory conflict of interest created by the employment of a law firm to represent the corporation in litigation while one of the members of the corporation’s board of commissioners is also a member of such law firm; such commissioner, however, should abstain from voting and absent himself from any meeting of the commission wherein the employment of his law firm is discussed or acted upon. OAG 82-1.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kentucky Medical Services Foundation, Inc., is a nonprofit corporation organized under this chapter, receives no state or local funding, and therefore is not a public agency under the Kentucky Open Record Law, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.870" target="_blank">61.870</a></cite> to<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.884" target="_blank">61.884.</a></cite> OAG 82-216.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private, nonprofit, nonstock corporations are not public agencies and are therefore not subject to the Open Meetings law; thus, a nonprofit, nonstock corporation formed under KRS Ch. 273 for the purpose of local approval of loans for small businesses is not subject to the Open Meetings law. OAG 84-186.

Acts ch. 51, effective 7/15/10, and repealed and reenacted with the new language by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 151, effective 1/1/2011. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment by ch. 51 not serve to void amendments made by other bills, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict, therefore, they have been codified together.

Whenever the Secretary of State shall certify the name of a corporation to the Attorney General as having given any cause for dissolution, the Secretary of State shall concurrently mail to the corporation at its registered office a notice that such certification has been made. Upon the receipt of such certification, the Attorney General may file an action in the name of the state against such corporation for its dissolution. Every such certificate from the Secretary of State to the Attorney General pertaining to the failure of a corporation to file an annual report shall be taken and received in all courts as prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.

Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict; therefore, they have been codified together. Effective 1/1/2011, this section was also repealed and reenacted by the omnibus Kentucky Business Entity Filing Act, 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 151.

       Pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIIc273s273.441" target="_self">273.441</a></cite> and subsection (2) of this section, any of the counties which have in legal effect designated a corporation as a community action agency may, subject to available funds and proper budgeting procedure under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68" target="_blank">Chapter 68</a></cite>, contribute, through the corporation, county funds for any of the purposes described specifically in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIIc273s273.441" target="_self">273.441</a></cite> and subsection (2) of this section, with the assumption that such county grants are made by way of an agreement between the county and the corporation that such county money will be spent for a designated purpose or purposes, the corporation subsequently reporting to the county government the precise nature and amount of the final expenditure. While Ky. Const., § 179 prohibits any county from appropriating money for any corporation, except for roads or bridges, this is no violation of § 179 as relates to county money expended under the community action agency legislation. For a county may select a nonprofit corporation as an instrumentality in carrying out a public purpose. OAG 85-117.

      <p>
       No across-the-board statement may be made as to whether all community action agencies in Kentucky are “units of local, municipal, county, or State government.” Rather, the circumstances, such as the relationship between the community action agency and the local government and the activity under review, must be considered as to each community action agency in question.

OAG 82-238.

      <p>
       Under subsection (1)(b) of this section a city may designate a community action corporation as an agent of the city for the implementation of various statutorily authorized public welfare projects. OAG 82-238.

       No across-the-board statement may be made as to whether all community action agencies in Kentucky are “units of local, municipal, county, or State government.” Rather, the circumstances, such as the relationship between the community action agency and the local government and the activity under review, must be considered as to each community action agency in question.

      <p>
       This section provides for designation of a community action agency by a political subdivision for the alleviation of poverty; a county, a municipal corporation, or combinations of counties and/or municipal corporations may designate the community action agency. Subsection (2) of this section allows for certain procedures whereby the chief elected official of the designating political subdivision may designate the community action agency for that political subdivision.

       (6/24/2015). During codification of 2015 Ky. Acts ch. 34, Sec. 29 (this statute), the Reviser of Statutes has changed the word “corporation” to “association.” KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc273As273A.125ol11b" target="_blank">Chapter 273A</a></cite>, dealing with unincorporated nonprofit associations, was created in that Act, and Section 29 of that Act was created as a new section of the new chapter. It is clear from the context that the reference to “corporation” in Section 29 of that Act was intended to be “association.” The Reviser of Statutes has corrected this manifest clerical or typographical error under the authority of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11h" target="_blank">7.136(1)(h)</a></cite>.

       (7/15/2010). This section was amended by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 133, and repealed and reenacted by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict; therefore, they have been codified together.

        It was indisputable that the statutes mandated that a limited liability company (LLC) be the named plaintiff in ay suit asserting a lost business income claim rightfully belonging to the LLC; the LLC and its solitary member were not legally interchangeable. Turner v. Andrew, 413 S.W.3d 272, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 580 (Ky. 2013).

       <p>
        Member created the limited liability company (LLC) and it appeared it was conducting the trucking business at issue, and by law, the only appropriate plaintiff to assert the lost business damages claim was the LLC; if the trial court was to find that the LLC was conducting the business on the date in question, defendants were entitled to summary judgment because the member personally had no standing to bring the business loss claim in his own name.

The correct citation, consistent with an identical change made to subsection 3(a) of this section by the Kentucky Business Entity Filing Act, has been substituted by the Reviser of Statutes under the authority of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11" target="_blank">7.136(1)</a></cite>.

       (7/15/2010). This section was amended by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 133, and repealed and reenacted by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51, both effective 7/15/2010. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict; therefore, they have been codified together. Effective 1/1/2011, this section was also repealed and reenacted by the omnibus Kentucky Business Entity Filing Act, 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 151.

        Judgment which did not award damages based on a managing member’s breach of fiduciary duty to a limited liability company (LLC) was error because, regardless of the LLC’s ability to complete projects diverted to another company formed by the managing member, the managing member could have and should have informed the other LLC members, and this conduct violated KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIIc275s275.170" target="_self">275.170</a></cite>; KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.8" target="_blank">271B.8</a></cite>-310(1) was illustrative of Kentucky law regarding the primacy of fiduciary duty over misappropriation of corporate opportunity, and the Court of Appeals of Kentucky adopted the doctrine of corporate opportunity.

        Employer-employee relationship is a familiar and well-established species of agency relationship, and it carries with it a wide range of specific legal obligations applicable in circumstances far beyond the Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health Act regulations; a member of a limited liability company (LLC) conducting business and performing work as an agent of the LLC does not automatically become an employee of the LLC.

        Limited liability company (LLC) was not an employee for purposes of the Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health Act because nothing in the record suggested that the sole member of the LLC was an employee of his own LLC.

        It was indisputable that the statutes mandated that a limited liability company (LLC) be the named plaintiff in ay suit asserting a lost business income claim rightfully belonging to the LLC; the LLC and its solitary member were not legally interchangeable. Turner v. Andrew, 413 S.W.3d 272, 2013 Ky. LEXIS 580 (Ky. 2013).

        Member created the limited liability company (LLC) and it appeared it was conducting the trucking business at issue, and by law, the only appropriate plaintiff to assert the lost business damages claim was the LLC; if the trial court was to find that the LLC was conducting the business on the date in question, defendants were entitled to summary judgment because the member personally had no standing to bring the business loss claim in his own name.

        Judgment which did not award damages based on a managing member’s breach of fiduciary duty to a limited liability company (LLC) was error because, regardless of the LLC’s ability to complete projects diverted to another company formed by the managing member, the managing member could have and should have informed the other LLC members, and this conduct violated KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIIc275s275.170" target="_self">275.170</a></cite>; KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271Bs271B.8" target="_blank">271B.8</a></cite>-310(1) was illustrative of Kentucky law regarding the primacy of fiduciary duty over misappropriation of corporate opportunity.

       <p>
        When awarding damages for a former limited liability company (LLC) member's breach of loyalty in diverting a business opportunity, it was error to deduct sums the former member paid to complete the opportunity because (1) Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 275.170 required the former member's complete disgorgement of any profits, (2) the deduction let the member keep most funds the member's misconduct generated, which the member had to hold in trust for the LLC, and (3) the member's total benefit from the diverted opportunity was not found.

        Per the language of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 275.170, 275.180, the existence and scope of any fiduciary duties owed by defendants, non managing members of the company, to debtor were governed exclusively by the Operating Agreements, which unambiguously waived any fiduciary duties defendants would have owed to the company. The Amended and Restated Operating Agreement similarly disclaimed any default statutory duties generally owed by members. Wheatley v. McCarty (In re CC Operations, LLC), 2020 Bankr.

       (1/1/2011). This section was repealed and reenacted without change to the existing language by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51, effective 7/15/10, and repealed and reenacted with the new language by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 151, effective 1/1/2011. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment by ch. 51 not serve to void amendments made by other bills, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict, therefore, they have been codified together.

        Simply acquiring economic rights does not, in and of itself, equate to “ownership” or “membership” in a limited liability company. Therefore, there was a failure of consideration for an agreement to purchase an ownership interest in a limited liability company because a seller did not have such an interest since he was not a member of the company under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIIc275s275.275" target="_self">275.275</a></cite>; at most, the seller had an interest that he received in exchange for tendering $75,000 to the company.

       (7/15/2010). This section was amended by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 133, and repealed and reenacted by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict; therefore, they have been codified together.

        Simply acquiring economic rights does not, in and of itself, equate to “ownership” or “membership” in a limited liability company. Therefore, there was a failure of consideration for an agreement to purchase an ownership interest in a limited liability company because a seller did not have such an interest since he was not a member of the company under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIIc275s275.275" target="_self">275.275</a></cite>; at most, the seller had an interest that he received in exchange for tendering $75,000 to the company.

       (7/15/2010). This section was amended by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 133, and repealed and reenacted by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 51. Pursuant to Section 184 of Acts ch. 51, it was the intent of the General Assembly that the repeal and reenactment not serve to void the amendment, and these Acts do not appear to be in conflict; therefore, they have been codified together.

       (6/29/2017). Subsection (5) of this statute concerning when a derivative action involving a limited liability company cannot be maintained was amended in
    2017 Ky. Acts ch. 188, sec. 2. New language added to subsection (5)(a) of this statute read, in part, “represent the interests of the shareholder in enforcing the rights.” In codification, the Reviser of Statutes corrected a manifest clerical or typographical error under the authority of
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11h" target="_blank">7.136(1)(h)</a></cite> by changing the word “shareholder” to “members” since limited liability companies do not have shareholders, but rather members, to be consistent with actual practice and language used in Sections 20 and 23 of that Act.

       (6/26/2007). Ky. Acts ch. 137, sec. 18, provided for the creation of a new section of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.33.html#tXXXIIIc386" target="_blank">Chapter 386</a></cite> to read as this section did when it took effect on June 26, 2007. Since the text of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIIc275s275.372" target="_self">275.372</a></cite> was almost identical to the text of subsection (1) of the new language of sec. 18, under the authority of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11a" target="_blank">7.136(1)(a)</a></cite>, the Reviser of Statutes in codification has amended KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIIc275s275.372" target="_self">275.372</a></cite> to conform and add subsection (2) to this section rather than creating a new section of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.33.html#tXXXIIIc386" target="_blank">Chapter 386</a></cite>.
