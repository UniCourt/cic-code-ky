     Actual settler — Preemption right.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      An actual settler on any vacant and unappropriated land has a preemption right to any number of acres, not exceeding one hundred (100), to be laid-off as nearly as possible in a square, his improvements in the center. Before any other person shall locate the same land, three (3) months’ notice of intention to do so must be given to the actual settler, describing the land intended to be taken up or appropriated. If the actual settler does not, within three (3) months from the giving of such notice, have the land entered and surveyed preparatory to obtaining a patent for it, the person giving the notice may enter and survey the land and proceed to obtain the patent.

        Once a settler had settled on vacant and unappropriated land he was not required to survey and patent his right in the land protected by this statute until he was given notice by another of intention to make surveys covering the land and where no attempt was made to prove notice was given before surveys were made by another and the settler did exercise his preemptive right, survey and obtain a patent within one year of the surveys, his patent, although junior in time was senior because of his preemptive right.

     <p>
      Any person who wishes to appropriate any vacant and unappropriated land may, by applying to the county judge/executive of the county in which the land lies, and paying therefor a price fixed by the fiscal court at not less than five dollars ($5) per hundred (100) acres, obtain an order authorizing him to enter and survey any number of acres of such land in the county, not to exceed two hundred (200). The party obtaining the order may, by an entry in the surveyor’s book of the county, describing the land, appropriate the quantity of land it calls for in one (1) or more parcels; but no one (1) person shall enter, survey or cause to be patented more than two hundred (200) acres of land in any one (1) county. The proceeds of the sale shall be paid into the county treasury.

      All that portion of the bed of the Ohio River, lying north of the thread of the stream, except accretions to islands privately owned, is declared to be vacant and unappropriated land, and the county judge/executive of each county bordering on the Ohio River may use or lease the river bed for county purposes, upon such terms and conditions as to him seem beneficial to the county. Any contract of leasing made by any such county judge/executive of such river bed for any sand and gravel rights for or on behalf of the county conveys full right and title to the lessee to the exclusive use of all sand and gravel deposits in the river bed to the extent embraced in the lease.

       <p>
        The expression “thread of the stream” as applied to the Ohio River means the middle line of the river as measured from the state’s northern boundary, the low watermark on the northern bank or shore, and the corresponding low watermark on the southern bank or shore and where plaintiff had a lease from a county to dredge sand and gravel north of the “thread of the stream” as authorized under this section a judgment in favor of riparian owners on the south bank of the river against plaintiff was affirmed where plaintiff dredged south of the middle of the river but north of the center line of the main channel which was close to the Kentucky shore at that point.

       The surveyor shall survey the entries in the order in which they are made, bounding each entry by plainly marked trees, stones or stakes, noting where it binds on a watercourse or the marked line of another survey, and giving names. The survey shall be made in the presence of two (2) disinterested housekeepers as chainmen, whose names shall be placed at the bottom of the plat and certificate. Each survey must be made within six (6) months after the date of the entry. A plat and certificate of the survey shall be made out by the surveyor and recorded in his books, and the original thereof and a copy of the order of court under which it is made shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State within six (6) months after the survey is made.

        Since the filing of a caveat with the register’s office is for the purpose of preventing the emanation therefrom of a patent for vacant and unappropriated land, to a claimant who is not entitled thereto, where there is a controversy between conflicting claimants as to the right to the patent, a party in possession of and claiming title to land is not required to enter a caveat with the register in order to prevent the issuing of a grant to another, but may for that purpose, commence his action in a court of chancery to enjoin the issuance of the grant.

        and 56.872(2) the costs of issuing bonds, inclusive of bond discount, capitalized interest, and a debt service reserve, are in fact and as a matter of law proper “costs of issuance” of such bonds, to be added to the authorized level of a revenue bond financed project (which construction project costs are delineated in capital construction sections of the biennial appropriations and budget report) in arriving at the authorized financing of such project. The power to include such financing costs in the total bond package is an implied power of the State Property and Buildings Commission in issuing revenue bonds under subsection (4) of this section; this implied power is clearly and inevitably necessary in order that the commission may carry out its express power of issuing revenue bonds.

       When the State Property and Buildings Commission makes a determination, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, that one (1) or more building projects or industrial development projects will be financed by the issuance of revenue bonds, then in anticipation of such financing the commission may borrow money to provide interim financing therefor and issue in evidence thereof its revenue bond anticipation notes, bearing interest at a rate or rates not exceeding the maximum rate permitted for the issuance of such bonds. Such interim financing may be entered into for the commission’s own projects, for those of the University of Kentucky and the state colleges or universities or for any other agency of the Commonwealth where approval by the commission is required regarding the issuance of revenue bonds of such an agency. In instances where the revenue bonds involved are to be issued by other agencies, such agencies, with the prior approval of the commission, may borrow money in the same manner and for the same purpose and issue in evidence thereof their own revenue bond anticipation notes, according to rules and regulations promulgated by the commission.
      </li>
      <li id="tVIIc56-propertyandbuildingscommissions56.513ol12">
       The commission shall solicit proposals for such interim financing from at least three (3) responsible lenders, and shall select in its discretion the best of such proposals consistent with sound financial practices. A selection may be made even though less than three (3) proposals are received. The term of any such revenue bond anticipation note shall not exceed five (5) years; and the same may be renewed, if necessary.
      </li>
      <li id="tVIIc56-propertyandbuildingscommissions56.513ol13">
       Each revenue bond anticipation note may include prepayment provisions which will allow the commission or other borrowing agency to prepay the loan after giving reasonable notice to the lender; shall identify the revenue bond issue from the proceeds of which the note or notes and any interest thereon are to be paid; and shall include a statement that the note is being issued in anticipation of the identified revenue bond issue, and that neither the note, nor the interest thereon, shall constitute or evidence an indebtedness of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Each such note and the interest thereon (to any extent not previously paid from other sources) shall be paid from the proceeds of the identified revenue bond issue, when such proceeds have been received and are available.

       Instead of borrowing money and issuing revenue bond anticipation notes in the full amount necessary for construction contract purposes, the commission (or such agencies with the prior approval of the commission and according to its rules and regulations), may enter into loan agreements with one (1) or more lenders (determined by the commission to be responsible) according to the terms of which it may be agreed:

         That the borrowing agency may demand and obtain cash advances against such commitment from time to time upon reasonable and agreed notice, and upon issuing in evidence of each advance a bond anticipation note which will bear an agreed rate of interest, not exceeding the maximum rate permitted for the issuance of the proposed bonds; and
        </li>
        <li id="tVIIc56-propertyandbuildingscommissions56.513ol14c">
         That in consideration of the making of such loan agreement the borrowing agency will pay to the lender or lenders a commitment fee determined by the commission to be reasonable according to financial conditions existing at the time the loan agreement is made.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="tVIIc56-propertyandbuildingscommissions56.513ol15">
       Each revenue bond anticipation note issued according to this section, and the receipt of interest thereon, shall be exempt from all taxation by the Commonwealth and all of its subdivisions, municipalities, and taxing authorities; and this may be stated as a representation in the text of each such revenue bond anticipation note.

       The costs of constructing buildings and improvements determined to be needed by the cabinet under this section may be paid in whole or in part (a) out of funds specifically appropriated for the construction of such buildings and improvements, or (b) out of funds derived or which may be derived from the issuance and sale of revenue bonds as authorized by this chapter or by KRS Chapter 58, or (c) by private capital under a conveyance and leaseback agreement as authorized by this section, or (d) by any combination of said methods.

Any mortgage placed on the land under this subsection shall not constitute a general obligation or debt of the Commonwealth but the Commonwealth may, in the event of default, redeem the mortgage if it so elects.

       Any building which the Finance and Administration Cabinet considers for leasing or purchase shall be evaluated for cost-effective energy use and energy efficiency. This evaluation shall be considered in choosing between competing leases or building purchases. The cabinet shall consider the energy costs of operating a building to ensure the selection of a cost-effective lease, and the cabinet shall compare life-cycle energy cost analyses for competing leases.

       A lease may be structured so that both the lessor and the state agency as lessee may share energy cost savings that can be accomplished by energy-efficient lease arrangements. The lease may incorporate financial incentives to make energy efficiency improvements that are cost effective in reducing the operating cost of the building. The lease may provide for the state agency to make lease payments which may be used to help fund the costs of energy conservation measures in the building, if the costs are amortized and returned to the state agency over a period of years not to exceed the useful life of the energy conservation measures. Thereafter, the state agency shall be entitled to a reduction in the lease amount based on any continued savings resulting from the energy conservation measures. The amount of reduction shall be negotiated between the lessor and the state agency.

       When an agency determines that it will need office or other space, the agency shall submit a request for the acquisition of the additional space to the Department for Facilities Management in the Finance and Administration Cabinet. Except in the case of an emergency as described at KRS 56.805(3), an agency shall submit its space request in writing to the department. In the case of an emergency, an agency shall communicate its space needs to the department pursuant to KRS 56.805(3) as soon as an agency knows that it will need the space. If the commissioner of the Department for Facilities Management determines that insufficient space has been allocated to the agency making the request and that it is appropriate to lease additional space for the agency making the request, the commissioner shall acquire the space required by lease as provided by KRS

      and subsection (2) of this section the costs of issuing bonds, inclusive of bond discount, capitalized interest, and a debt service reserve, are in fact and as a matter of law proper “costs of issuance” of such bonds, to be added to the authorized level of a revenue bond financed project (which construction project costs are delineated in capital construction sections of the biennial appropriations and budget report) in arriving at the authorized financing of such project. The power to include such financing costs in the total bond package is an implied power of the State Property and Buildings Commission in issuing revenue bonds under KRS 56.450(4); this implied power is clearly and inevitably necessary in order that the commission may carry out its express power of issuing revenue bonds.

      Recognizing that ink produced from soybean oil is biodegradable with no known negative environmental impact, and that the state’s farmers are economically distressed and need additional income, it is the public policy of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that state agencies shall use printing ink produced from soybean oil if the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet determines that it is cost effective. The secretary shall make the determination of cost effectiveness each year. If the secretary determines the use of soybean oil ink is cost effective, he shall implement procedures requiring its use for printing.

The latter amendment, being more specific, was intended to take precedence over the general provisions of the former. Bowling Green v. Board of Education, 443 S.W.2d 243, 1969

        If the county decides to issue county government obligation bonds instead of revenue bonds which would not be county obligations, then the limitations of Ky. Const., §§ 157 and 158 would have to be considered and, if an emergency were shown, the 2% limit could be exceeded but if the obligation exceeded the income and revenue of the county for a one year period, the question would have to be submitted to the voters and whatever amount was borrowed would have to be measured against the limitations.

      Under this section and KRS 56.872(2) the costs of issuing bonds, inclusive of bond discount, capitalized interest, and a debt service reserve, are in fact and as a matter of law proper “costs of issuance” of such bonds, to be added to the authorized level of a revenue bond financed project (which construction project costs are delineated in capital construction sections of the biennial appropriations and budget report) in arriving at the authorized financing of such project. The power to include such financing costs in the total bond package is an implied power of the State Property and Buildings Commission in issuing revenue bonds under KRS 56.450(4); this implied power is clearly and inevitably necessary in order that the commission may carry out its express power of issuing revenue bonds.
