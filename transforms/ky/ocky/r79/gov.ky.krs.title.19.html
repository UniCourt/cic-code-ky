        As used in<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc226" target="_self">Chapter 226</a></cite>, “deposit” clearly requires that personal property be relinquished by its owner and committed to the physical custody of the pawnbroker, and where, in a car title pledge transaction, a pawnbroker obtains only a lien on the customer’s car, not physical possession of the vehicle, this procedure amounts to a secured loan rather than a true pawn.

        Among its reasons authorizing pawnbrokers to charge the high fee of 20% of the unpaid principal balance, this section explicitly cites the purpose of “storing and insuring the property”; therefore, the pawnbroker must have actual physical custody of the personal property, not merely constructive possession, in order to charge the interest and fees set out in this section.

      <p>
       Since the legislature was obviously well aware when it enacted this section that the storage of items deposited with or sold to pawnbrokers was a normal part of the business, it is clear that the legislature intended for any storage costs to be included in and absorbed by the 31/2 percent per month rate it allowed and did not intend to allow a service charge in addition to the charges permitted under this section because service charges have long been considered a portion of the consideration of a loan and, as such, are not usurious only if they are expressly permitted by statute.<cite class=OAG>OAG 80-87</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Storage fees and/or service charges in excess of the statutory interest rate which were being made by pawnbrokers were illegal as an apparent attempt to avoid or circumvent the maximum charge permitted by this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 80-87</cite>.

        The fact that the Legislature in this section recognizes the magnitude of arson problems and directs investigation and enforcement of laws concerning it does not enhance or broaden the hearsay rule exception that an expert witness may express a testimonial opinion that is based in part upon hearsay evidence. Therefore, it was not error for the trial court to prohibit state police officers from directly testifying and relating hearsay testimony in question, the effect of which would have been that they had statements from the persons who allegedly did the actual burning who told them that the person allegedly hired by the insureds to burn the building told the person who allegedly did the actual burning that the insured hired him to hire them to burn the premises and its contents for a certain sum of money and that they did so.

Such participation shall be by representation of professional associations relating to infant and preschool care, and by representation from other individuals licensed to provide infant and preschool care, on a committee chaired by the state fire marshal or his or her designate. Such participation shall occur prior to the publication of proposed regulations in the administrative register pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc13As13A.050" target="_blank">13A.050</a></cite> but shall not limit any individual’s right to use those procedures set forth in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc13A" target="_blank">Chapter 13A</a></cite> concerning comment on or protest of proposed regulations.

       <p>
        Violation of “standards of safety” regulation adopted under this section, forbidding storage or handling of flammable liquid in service station building, was negligence per se. Home Ins. Co. v. Hamilton, 253 F. Supp. 752, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7758 (E.D.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 1966</cite>), rev'd, 395 F.2d 108, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 6873 (6th Cir.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 1968</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Insurance pursuant to subsection (1) of this section have the force of statutory law, and where a regulation adopted a national fire code pamphlet which required gasoline storage tank owners to frequently gauge the tank while it was being filled and to have a bell that rang as the tank neared being full, the violation of both of these requirements by a storage tank owner was presumed to have been a cause of the fire which resulted when the tanks were being filled. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Stokes Oil Co., 639 F. Supp. 291, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24810 (W.D.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 1986</cite>), aff'd, 863 F.2d 1250, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 16764 (6th Cir.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 1988</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since under this section regulations have statutory authority, defendant was required to comply with regulation regarding transfer of gasoline from a barge to a storage tank that required an alarm system to alert personnel to shut down the system or to automatically shut down the system when an overflow occurred or to gauge the tank at frequent intervals and maintain communications so that the flow could promptly be shut down or diverted, and argument that defendant had previously calculated that tank could have easily held the unleaded gasoline the parties had intended to pump into it was without merit. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Stokes Oil Co., 863 F.2d 1250, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 16764 (6th Cir.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 1988</cite>).

        Though fire regulations relating to presence of fire extinguishers in apartment buildings were too vague and thus did not provide basis for holding that an owner and builder who allegedly failed to comply therewith was guilty of negligence per se, a jury could nevertheless consider the regulations in making a determination of owner’s liability for fire damage based on common-law negligence. Bostic v. East Constr. Co., 497 F.2d 712, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 8381 (6th Cir.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 1974</cite>).

        Although the National Fire Protection Association Standard has required smoke detectors in one (1) and two (2) -family dwellings since 1976, the Kentucky legislature and those to whom it has delegated rulemaking authority are not required to create a standard equivalent to one created by another rule making body, and since the standards adopted by the administrative agency, pursuant to this section are unambiguous in their intent to exempt single family dwellings from these requirements, the court refrained from judicially creating this requirement.

       Before a fiscal court could employ a contractor to repair a courthouse, the court had to first have plans for remodeling the structure from an architect or professional engineer.<cite class=OAG>OAG 70-111</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plans for remodeling a courthouse which was closed as a fire hazard by order of the state fire marshal must meet the requirements of the standards of safety promulgated pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc227s227.300" target="_self">227.300</a></cite> and be prepared by an architect or professional engineer.<cite class=OAG>OAG 70-111</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that deficiencies had been noted in the courthouse building by the Fire Marshal’s office would not necessarily preclude the county from proceeding to remodel the courtroom of the courthouse, presuming, however, that the county adhered to the requirements of the administrative regulations adopted on behalf of the State Fire Marshal’s office by submitting, to the State Fire Marshal’s office for inspection and approval by that office, the plans and specifications involving the proposed remodeling project; even if the county complied with the requirements of the regulation and obtained a permit to remodel the courtroom, it would not be relieved of its obligation to correct all the other deficiencies in the courthouse discovered by the State Fire Marshal’s office during the course of its authorized inspections.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-187</cite>.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If any owner fails to comply with a summary order or an order of the state fire marshal, his authorized designee or a fire inspector, or with an order as modified on appeal, the state fire marshal may cause the property to be repaired, or removed if repair is not feasible, or all fire hazard conditions remedied, at the expense of the owner. Such expense may be enforced against any property of such owner, and the state fire marshal and those employed by him to do the work or who furnish materials or equipment therefor, shall have a lien for such expense on the real estate property involved.

       This section would require the inspection officer to have reason to believe unsafe conditions exist in an occupied building before an inspection can be made, unless a fire was evident.<cite class=OAG>OAG 71-17</cite>.

       The reports of two (2) fires prepared by a fire chief following his investigations were validly withheld from the public pursuant to this section and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11h" target="_blank">61.878(1)(h)</a></cite>.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-19</cite>.

      <p>
       Denial of request for access to lists of fire and building code violations prepared by the chief, or his designee, and the city inspector, was improper as this section does not vest the chief with discretion to withhold information pertaining to violations noted in his inspection and thus subdivision (1)(j) of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878" target="_blank">61.878</a></cite> is inapplicable; moreover inspection reports are not “preliminary” within the meaning of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878" target="_blank">61.878</a></cite>(1)(h).<cite class=OAG>OAG 91-100</cite>.

       Cities with populations equal to or greater than twenty thousand (20,000) based upon the most recent federal decennial census or urban-county governments may under ordinance duly enacted appoint inspectors or officers who have power to issue written orders directing owners of heaters or occupants of structures in which heaters are installed, to discontinue the use or operation of a proscribed heater and to specify conditions which must be met before said proscribed heater may again be used or operated. Said order may be issued if said authorized person has actual knowledge of the existence of a proscribed heater, and, in the opinion of said authorized person, the continued use or operation of said proscribed heater would constitute a danger to life or health; provided however, no person, agency, firm, or corporation (other than the owner, user, seller, or installer of a proscribed heater) shall be liable for civil damages for his or her or its failure to recognize a proscribed heater, for failure to issue the order described in this subsection, for complying with said order, for assisting with the compliance therewith, or for allowing the continued use or operation of a proscribed heater prior to receipt of said order.

      <p>
       “Electrical inspectors” employed by cities of the second and third classes are subject to regulation and the only certificate or license which the public service commission, previously the state board of examiners of electrical inspectors, would have power to grant would be for electrical inspectors already employees of the particular city and/or county for which they applied, which license would have statewide application.<cite class=OAG>OAG 73-607</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the Public Service Commission examines and certifies electrical inspectors who are then qualified to be employed by cities to perform inspections under the respective electrical ordinances, the Commission has no authority to make electrical inspections.<cite class=OAG>OAG 76-296</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a city has adopted an electrical code, the city has the authority to designate a specific firm to make electrical inspections, as long as the persons designated by the firm to represent it and the city are duly certified by the Public Service Commission.<cite class=OAG>OAG 76-296</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city of the second class would have no authority to impose its electrical permit system upon the State’s electrical contractor who is working on the construction project of a state university.<cite class=OAG>OAG 77-445</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While this section, as amended by the 1978 regular session of the General Assembly, excludes from the definition of an “electrical inspector” a person who inspects to ascertain the compliance with the electrical code of any city, it includes one who inspects to ascertain compliance with the State’s standards of safety; since cities are now required to adopt and enforce the State’s standards of safety which include the national electrical code and which prevail over any conflicting or inconsistent provisions adopted by the city, therefore, the city, to perform its statutorily imposed duties, will have to have an electrical inspector certified, pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc227s227.489" target="_self">227.489</a></cite>, by the commissioner of housing, buildings and construction.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-792</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a city has a contract with a part-time electrical inspector to enforce the city’s electrical code, but does not pay him directly by either salary or fee, leaving the matter of compensation to be paid him by the consumer, the inspector would be liable for his own negligence while the liability of the city would depend upon whether he was an employee or independent contractor, with the city not being liable in the latter case.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-112</cite>.

       If a county has an inspection program the county may designate a particular firm or person to act as its electrical inspector as long as the inspections are performed by inspectors certified by the Public Service Commission.<cite class=OAG>OAG 77-330</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Uniform State Building Code became mandatorily effective in the counties of Boyd, Campbell, Daviess, Fayette, Franklin, Jefferson, Kenton, McCracken and Warren on February 15, 1980; other Kentucky counties, including Whitley County, were covered effective August 15, 1981, and the remaining counties will be mandatorily covered effective August 15, 1982.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-30</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the duty and responsibility of the municipal government to employ its own certified inspectors or to enter into an interlocal agreement with another governmental entity, utilizing the inspectors of that entity, to conduct the required inspections and the statutes do not contemplate free-lance certified electrical inspectors contracting directly with the owners or occupiers of houses and other buildings to conduct electrical inspections; now that the Kentucky Building Code is mandatorily effective in the state, the enforcement of the code within a city, including the national electrical code which is part of the Kentucky Building Code, is the responsibility of the city.<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-32</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local enforcement of the national electrical code is contemplated.<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-32</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A house or other building subject to the requirements of the national electrical code and located within the municipal limits is not eligible to receive a hookup to an electric source and electric service from electric utility until it has been inspected by a certified electrical inspector authorized to perform electrical inspections for the city; thus, a city was not required to connect power to a structure approved by a certified inspector other than the city inspector nor could the head of the city light and water department, without approval of the city’s legislative body, approve a hookup to a structure within the city limits which was inspected by someone other than the city inspector.<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-32</cite>.

       A regulation, adopted by a city or county legislative body, which includes modular homes in the definition of “mobile homes” is invalid since it is at variance with the statutory definition of that term.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-249</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not apply to real estate brokers and salesmen who list for sale mobile homes which are classified as real estate by the property valuation administrator under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132s132.750" target="_blank">132.750</a></cite> (now repealed).<cite class=OAG>OAG 77-57</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A mobile home broker who acts as a “mere negotiator” between a mobile home owner and prospective purchasers is not considered a dealer under the Mobile Home Recreational Vehicle Act (MHRVA); however, if the broker acquires ownership or possession for resale purposes of three or more mobile homes in any consecutive 12-month period, the broker becomes a dealer subject to the provisions of the MHRVA and accompanying regulations. Furthermore, once a person qualifies as a dealer, his or her duty to inspect and certify mobile homes applies to all mobile homes that he or she sells or offers for sale and there are no transactional exemptions.<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-261</cite>, 84-347.

       Persons who conducted a private showing of the Clay-Liston match through the medium of closed circuit television were required to have an annual license, to pay the commission 5% of the gross receipts from the sale of all tickets, and to post bond in the sum of $2,000.<cite class=OAG>OAG 65-414</cite>.

       The only document which the commission is authorized to issue regarding amateur boxing or wrestling matches or exhibitions is a permit to hold the event, but before issuing a permit to hold a match or exhibition sanctioned by the A.A.U. the commission should first receive a copy of the sanction.<cite class=OAG>OAG 77-253</cite>.

       The commission cannot govern or control amateur bouts which are sanctioned by the A.A.U., for the commission’s only authority is to issue permits to hold matches and exhibitions.<cite class=OAG>OAG 77-253</cite>.

       The Kentucky Racing Commission must exercise its discretion in deciding whether to award a license to an organization that does not plan to conduct live racing during the year for which the license is sought.

        Jockeys were entitled to a preliminary injunction enjoining the Kentucky Racing Commission and the Kentucky Horse Racing Authority from enforcing 810 KAR 1:009, § 14(3), which was promulgated pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.215ol12" target="_self">230.215(2)</a></cite> and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.260" target="_self">230.260</a></cite>, because the jockeys established a likelihood of success on their claim that the regulation, which prohibited the jockeys from wearing advertising and promotional logos on their racing attire, violated U.S. Const. amend. 1; the Commission and Authority failed to establish that the regulation had a direct or material nexus to their stated objectives of assessing foul play and avoiding collusion. Albarado v. Ky. Racing Comm'n, 496 F. Supp. 2d 795, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30566 (W.D.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 2004</cite>).

        Kentucky Horse Racing Commission has the statutory authority to license and regulate the operation of pari-mutuel wagering on historic horse racing. Because the regulations for the licensing of historical horse race wagering are consistent with the statutory mandate for “pari-mutuel wagering” on “legitimate horse racing,” the Commission did not exceed the scope of its authority, and the regulations are therefore not invalid. Appalachian Racing, LLC v. Family Trust Found. of Ky., Inc., 423 S.W.3d 726, 2014<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 88</cite> (Ky. 2014).

       <p>
        Circuit court erred in overturning penalties the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission imposed upon a trainer and an owner because the 1.0 ng/ml threshold concentration for methocarbamol was not unconstitutional nor arbitrary since limiting the amount of a drug in a horse’s system that was not fully understood was a rational reason for the low threshold; by limiting the amount of medications and drugs given to horses, the Commission was protecting their health and ensuring the integrity of racing. Ky. Horse Racing Comm'n v. Motion, 592 S.W.3d 739, 2019<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 49</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since there is a rational basis for the methocarbamol threshold to be low, and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission is vested with expansive powers, it is axiomatic that this threshold does not exceed the scope of its enabling act; thus, the circuit court erred in holding that the Commission acted outside the scope of its powers. Ky. Horse Racing Comm'n v. Motion, 592 S.W.3d 739, 2019<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 49</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).

       Although the racing commission has broad regulatory power over all aspects of the conduct of racing, there is no basis in the statutes for any power in the racing commission to regulate the various activities of a racing association that have nothing to do with the staging of the racing, the quality or integrity of the racing and wagering programs or the improvement of the breed of thoroughbred horses; therefore the commission has no jurisdiction over such things as newspaper and other media advertising, printing of programs, magazine features, food and drink concessions, television, radio or motion picture rights, labor conditions (including hours, wages, pensions, etc.), leases of maintenance vehicles or passenger cars, physical plant improvements, and the like, many of which are under the jurisdiction of other regulatory agencies, such as the department of labor, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, the State Fire Marshal, the planning and zoning commission, etc.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-731</cite> (Opinion withdrawn to the extent of conflict with<cite class=OAG>OAG 86-63</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       In over 70 years of regulated racing in Kentucky, it has never been considered that such things as television, radio and/or motion picture rights, labor relations, catering and concessions, or leasing of nonracing facilities are racing activities within the regulatory power of the racing commission; therefore, it must be considered that they are not.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-731</cite> (Opinion withdrawn to the extent of conflict with<cite class=OAG>OAG 86-63</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is highly significant that the stated objects and purposes, and the stated regulatory powers of the commission, are confined to conduct of “racing,” the objects and purposes being to see that “racing” is conducted on a high plane, that “racing” is conducted so as to encourage improvement of the breed, and that persons participating in or attending “racing” be honest and of integrity.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-731</cite> (Opinion withdrawn to the extent of conflict with<cite class=OAG>OAG 86-63</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the state allowed a track to rely on its consistent scheduling of race days for 59 years, and based on the fact that both the track and the state had expended funds in reliance on that consistency, the state cannot without strong justification, deprive the track of its property interest in those dates. Thus, if the commission were to contemplate the issuance of conflicting dates, then such track would be entitled to full procedural due process.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-436</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the state can issue conflicting racing dates, affected licensees are entitled to a full due process hearing, and any decision by the commission to grant conflicting dates must be based upon established facts showing that conflicting dates would not violate the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.300ol12" target="_self">230.300(2)</a></cite>. Failing such determination, any request for conflicting dates must be denied.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-436</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instant Racing is not permissible under Kentucky’s current pari-mutuel wagering statutes because it does not constitute pari-mutuel wagering as defined by Kentucky’s Administrative Regulations.<cite class=OAG>OAG 10-001</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission has the power to make reasonable warrantless administrative searches and seizures of any property of its licensees on association grounds, with the exception of private dwelling areas, for any items that may be relevant to its investigations.<cite class=OAG>OAG 10-009</cite>, 2010 Ky.

        The power to appoint members of boards and agencies within the executive department of government is an essentially executive power which cannot be exercised by any member of the legislative department; accordingly, the provisions in former law by which the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tem of the Senate were authorized to make appointments to the Harness Racing Commission were an invalid unconstitutional incursion by the General Assembly, or in this case, its designees, into the separation of powers doctrine. Legislative Research Com. by Prather v. Brown, 664 S.W.2d 907, 1984<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 300</cite> (Ky. 1984) (decided under prior law).

        The person so designated as the Chairman of the Kentucky State Racing Commission was of comparable rank to the executive head of a department of state government for the purpose of absolute immunity for defamation stemming from statements sufficiently connected to the discharge of official duties.

        Where in the course of investigating a potential rules violation, which threatened the integrity of thoroughbred racing in Kentucky, the Chairman of State Racing Commission issued an explanatory press release, and where it was later determined that the press release contained materially false information, the press release was sufficiently connected to the discharge of the chairman’s official duties to justify absolute immunity from a defamation action stemming from the false information contained in the press release.

        The law regulating racing of running horses was valid notwithstanding considerations to guide commission in fixing racing dates were not set forth, where law contemplated that commission should act along reasonable lines and in honest exercise of discretion regardless of whether appeal to courts was provided as to fixing of dates.

        Since there is a rational basis for the methocarbamol threshold to be low, and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission is vested with expansive powers, it is axiomatic that this threshold does not exceed the scope of its enabling act; thus, the circuit court erred in holding that the Commission acted outside the scope of its powers.

        Kentucky Horse Racing Authority (KHRA) disqualifed a harness horse as the winner of two races due to the presence of flunixin in its urine. The Circuit Court properly affirmed this decision because (1) the KHRA’s finding was not arbitrary and capricious, as it was supported by substantial evidence; (2) it was unnecessary to establish a perfect chain of custody and the evidence showed there was no tampering with the urine samples; (3) the “trainer responsibility rule” (811 KAR 1:090) was constitutional; (4) there was no double jeopardy violation, since the action was civil in nature; and (5) 811 KAR 1:090, § 4(1), which outlawed flunixin for harness horses but not thoroughbreds, did not violate equal protection principles.

        Jockeys were entitled to a preliminary injunction enjoining the Kentucky Racing Commission and the Kentucky Horse Racing Authority (now the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission) from enforcing 810 KAR 1:009, § 14(3), which was promulgated pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.215ol12" target="_self">230.215(2)</a></cite> and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.260" target="_self">230.260</a></cite>, because the jockeys established a likelihood of success on their claim that the regulation, which prohibited the jockeys from wearing advertising and promotional logos on their racing attire, violated U.S. Const. amend. 1; the Commission and Authority failed to establish that the regulation had a direct or material nexus to their stated objectives of assessing foul play and avoiding collusion. Albarado v. Ky. Racing Comm'n, 496 F. Supp. 2d 795, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30566 (W.D.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 2004</cite>).

       <p>
        Trial court properly found that
    810 Ky. Admin. Regs. 1:015, § 1, art. 6, did not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause where the regulation of horse racing was a traditional governmental function in Kentucky that had been exercised to protect the public’s health, safety and welfare, it applied equally to in-state and out-of-state horse owners, and the impact on interstate commerce was speculative and incidental. Jamgotchian v. Ky. Horse Racing Comm'n, 2014 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 851 (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 7, 2014), aff'd, 488 S.W.3d 594, 2016<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 171</cite> (Ky. 2016).

       Under a regulation promulgated by the racing commission pari-mutuel wagering may be conducted only by a licensed racing association holding a race, and only on that association’s “licensed premises” or “within the enclosure” where the race is being held; accordingly, a “teletrack” system, which consists of opening licensed racetracks for the purpose of wagering on televised races being conducted at another track, is prohibited, since no association may conduct wagering on any race held by another association.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-4</cite>.

       By giving the commission the power to remedy the disruptions in the regularly scheduled racing the Legislature intended that where extraordinary circumstances intervene, orderly procedure must bow to the overall purpose of fostering and encouraging the legitimate business of thoroughbred racing.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-572</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission may award as many additional racing dates, above and beyond the number of dates cancelled, as are necessary to make recovery of the cancelled dates, and of the loss to the industry and the state which resulted from the cancellations, feasible.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-572</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement that the commission decide who shall be awarded what dates by March (now November) 1 of each year is designed to promote orderly procedure and certainty, thereby serving the overall policy of this chapter that the business of legitimate thoroughbred racing shall be conducted on the highest possible plane.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-572</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clear that the Legislature intended the March (now November) 1 deadline in subsection (2) of this section to be absolute except in certain limited circumstances.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-366</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not within the scope of authority of the Kentucky State Racing Commission to award additional racing dates after the March (now November) 1 deadline in the absence of the cancellation of previously scheduled dates due to flood, fire or inclement weather or an extraordinary disruption of the orderly conduct of business amounting to the same crisis level as a natural disaster; a change in stable allocation policy by one race track is not such an unforeseeable, harmful circumstance as to warrant the award of additional racing dates to a second race track after the deadline.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-366</cite>.

       The State Racing Commission has the authority, pursuant to subsection (2) of this section to grant concurrent racing dates to two or more licensees; the language of subsection (2) of this section does not prohibit the commission from awarding concurrent dates, but merely establishes the effects of concurrent racing as one criteria which the commission must examine when awarding racing dates pursuant to its discretionary power and if the commission finds that awarding concurrent dates to two or more licensees would “serve to nurture, promote, develop, or improve the thoroughbred industry in the Commonwealth” after it considers all the criteria set forth in subsection (2) of this section, it may do so.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-375</cite>.

       Under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.280" target="_self">230.280</a></cite>,<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.361" target="_self">230.361</a></cite> and this section, the State Racing Commission is only authorized to license meetings and by being so licensed to conduct a meeting the licensee has the resulting power to conduct pari-mutuel wagering if it so desires; of course, such wagering must be conducted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission, but no separate license is statutorily required or authorized.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-98</cite>.

      <p>
       KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.210ol17" target="_self">230.210(7)</a></cite>, prior to its 1986 amendment, defined a thoroughbred race meeting in terms which excluded steeplechase events, and since the commission lacks authority to grant a license to conduct a race except at a thoroughbred race meeting, steeplechase events are outside the jurisdiction of the commission; thus, since under the terms of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.361" target="_self">230.361</a></cite> no pari-mutuel wagering may be conducted except by persons licensed to conduct thoroughbred race meetings, the commission had no authority to license pari-mutuel wagering at a steeplechase event.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-98</cite> (Opinions prior to 1986 amendment of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.210" target="_self">230.210</a></cite>.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the state allowed a track to rely on its consistent scheduling of race days for 59 years, and based on the fact that both the track and the state had expended funds in reliance on that consistency, the state cannot without strong justification, deprive the track of its property interest in those dates. Thus, if the commission were to contemplate the issuance of conflicting dates, then such track would be entitled to full procedural due process.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-436</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the state can issue conflicting racing dates, affected licensees are entitled to a full due process hearing, and any decision by the commission to grant conflicting dates must be based upon established facts showing that conflicting dates would not violate the provisions of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.215ol11" target="_self">230.215(1)</a></cite> and subsection (2) of this section. Failing such determination, any request for conflicting dates must be denied.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-436</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.310" target="_self">230.310</a></cite> specifically provides for the State Racing Commission to license suppliers of food, the licensing of concessionaires would not only seem to be permitted, but a function which the Commission is obligated to perform.<cite class=OAG>OAG 86-63</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in 1992, ch. 109 (HB 749) or in this chapter restricts investments in the entity comprising a licensed track. The only possible restriction comes from subsection (2) of this section, under which the racing commission is authorized to consider the financial stability of an applicant for a license and the “character and reputation for honesty of all persons identified with” the applicant.<cite class=OAG>OAG 92-50</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the simulcast facility is maintained and operated by a licensed track, local interests may invest in the facility through a joint venture with the track or through the purchase of an ownership interest in the track.<cite class=OAG>OAG 92-50</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to a request for copies of applications for 2000 racing licenses and 2000 racing dates for all Kentucky racetracks, the applications did not qualify for exclusion under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11i" target="_blank">61.878(1)(i)</a></cite>, but portions of the applications could be withheld under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11c" target="_blank">61.878(1)(c)</a></cite>2.d. upon a showing that those portions were confidentially disclosed to the Kentucky Racing Commission, were generally recognized as confidential or proprietary, and were compiled and maintained for the grant or review of a license to do business.

No person required to be licensed by this section may participate in any activity required to be licensed on association grounds during a race meeting without a valid license therefor. An applicant for a license shall submit to the racing commission fingerprints as may be required and other information necessary and reasonable for processing a license application. The racing commission is authorized to exchange fingerprint data with the Department of Kentucky State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to conduct a criminal history background check of an applicant. The racing commission may issue a license if it finds that the financial responsibility, age, experience, reputation, competence, and general fitness of the applicant to perform the activity permitted by a license are consistent with the best interest of racing and the maintenance of the honesty, integrity, and high quality thereof.

       A license may be issued for the calendar year for which an applicant applies or, if authorized by administrative regulation, a license may be issued that expires on the last day of the birth month of the licensee. A license may be renewed by the racing commission. The license shall be valid at all horse race meetings in the Commonwealth during the period for which it is issued unless suspended or revoked under the administrative regulations promulgated by the racing commission under this chapter. With respect to horse owners and trainers, the racing commission may promulgate administrative regulations to facilitate and promote uniform, reciprocal licensing with other states.

         1. Disqualification of Horse.
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Kentucky Horse Racing Authority (KHRA) disqualifed a harness horse as the winner of two (2) races due to the presence of flunixin in its urine. The Circuit Court properly affirmed this decision because (1) the KHRA’s finding was not arbitrary and capricious, as it was supported by substantial evidence; (2) it was unnecessary to establish a perfect chain of custody and the evidence showed there was no tampering with the urine samples; (3) the “trainer responsibility rule” (811 KAR 1:090) was constitutional; (4) there was no double jeopardy violation, since the action was civil in nature; and (5) 811 KAR 1:090, § 4(1), which outlawed flunixin for harness horses but not thoroughbreds, did not violate equal protection principles.

       <p>
        Circuit court correctly allowed a case to proceed because the case was commenced in good faith since a trainer and an owner gave copies of their appeal to the Attorney General and to agents of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission within the 30-day timeframe and had summonses issued; they intended to properly commence the action and believed a summons was not necessary, and that belief was reasonable based on the wording of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13B.140 and the lack of published case law. Ky. Horse Racing Comm'n v. Motion, 592 S.W.3d 739, 2019<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 49</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).

       Under a regulation promulgated by the racing commission pari-mutuel wagering may be conducted only by a licensed racing association holding a race, and only on that association’s “licensed premises” or “within the enclosure” where the race is being held; accordingly, a “teletrack” system, which consists of opening licensed racetracks for the purpose of wagering on televised races being conducted at another track, is prohibited, since no association may conduct wagering on any race held by another association.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-4</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.210ol17" target="_self">230.210(7)</a></cite> defines a thoroughbred race meeting in terms which exclude steeplechase events, and since the commission lacks authority to grant a license to conduct a race except at a thoroughbred race meeting, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.300ol11" target="_self">230.300(1)</a></cite>, steeplechase events are outside the jurisdiction of the commission; thus, since under the terms of this section no pari-mutuel wagering may be conducted except by persons licensed to conduct thoroughbred race meetings, the commission has no authority to license pari-mutuel wagering at a steeplechase event.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-98</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.280" target="_self">230.280</a></cite>,<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.300" target="_self">230.300</a></cite> and this section, the State Racing Commission is only authorized to license meetings and by being so licensed to conduct a meeting the licensee has the resulting power to conduct pari-mutuel wagering if it so desires; of course, such wagering must be conducted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the commission, but no separate license is statutorily required or authorized.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-98</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although games of chance using videotapes of past horse races or straight wagering on these videotaped races at a “casino night” would not be “live,” they would still violate the raffle requirements of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc238s238.505ol18" target="_self">238.505(8)</a></cite> and<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc238s238.545" target="_self">238.545(</a></cite>3), and also violate the parimutuel wagering statutes, which provide that parimutuel wagering shall be conducted only by a person authorized under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230" target="_self">Chapter 230</a></cite> to conduct a race meeting and only upon a licensed premises.<cite class=OAG>OAG 95-23</cite>.

       Subsection (1) of this section should not be construed as prohibiting activities permitted by KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc230s230.379" target="_self">230.379</a></cite>.<cite class=OAG>OAG 04-005</cite>.

       Instant Racing is not permissible under Kentucky’s current pari-mutuel wagering statutes because it does not constitute pari-mutuel wagering as defined by Kentucky’s Administrative Regulations.<cite class=OAG>OAG 10-001</cite>.

      SECTION 6. Compact committee established.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is hereby created an interstate governmental entity to be known as the “compact committee,” which shall be comprised of one (1) official from the racing commission or its equivalent in each party state who shall be appointed, serve and be subject to removal in accordance with the laws of the party state he represents. Pursuant to the laws of his party state, each official shall have the assistance of his state’s racing commission or the equivalent thereof in considering issues related to licensing of participants in live racing and in fulfilling his responsibilities as the representative from his state to the compact committee. If an official is unable to perform any duty in connection with the powers and duties of the compact committee, the racing commission or equivalent thereof from his state shall designate another of its members as an alternate who shall serve in his place and represent the party state as its official on the compact committee until that racing commission or equivalent thereof determines that the original representative official is able once again to perform his duties as that party state’s representative official on the compact committee. The designation of an alternate shall be communicated by the affected state’s racing commission or equivalent thereof to the compact committee as the committee’s bylaws may provide.
     </p>
     <p>
      SECTION 7. Powers and duties of compact committee.

      In order to carry out the purposes of this compact, the compact committee is hereby granted the power and duty to:

       Determine which categories of participants in live horse racing, including but not limited to owners, trainers, jockeys, grooms, mutuel clerks, racing officials, veterinarians, and farriers, and which categories of equivalent participants in dog racing and other forms of live racing with pari-mutuel wagering authorized in two (2) or more of the party states, should be licensed by the committee, and establish the requirements for the initial licensure of applicants in each such category, the term of the license for each category, and the requirements for renewal of licenses in each category. Provided, however, that with regard to requests for criminal history record information on each applicant for a license, and with regard to the effect of a criminal record on the issuance or renewal of a license, the compact committee shall determine for each category of participants in live racing which licensure requirements for that category are, in its judgment, the most restrictive licensure requirements of any party state for that category and shall adopt licensure requirements for that category that are, in its judgment, comparable to those most restrictive requirements.

Only officials on, and employees of, the compact committee may receive and review such criminal history record information, and those officials and employees may use that information only for the purposes of this compact. No such official or employee may disclose or disseminate such information to any person or entity other than another official on or employee of the compact committee. The fingerprints of each applicant for a license from the compact committee shall be taken by the compact committee, its employees, or its designee and, pursuant to Public Law 92-544 or Public Law 100-413, shall be forwarded to a state identification bureau, or to an association of state officials regulating pari-mutuel wagering designated by the Attorney General of the United States, for submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a criminal history record check. Such fingerprints may be submitted on a fingerprint card or by electronic or other means authorized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other receiving law enforcement agency.

It shall establish the term for each category, and the license criteria and weight given to character and integrity information that in its judgment meet the most restrictive requirements of the member states. The compact commission shall not have the power or authority to deny a license. If it determines that an applicant will not be eligible, it shall notify the applicant that it will not be able to process the application any further, which shall not constitute and shall not be considered to be the denial of a license. Although an applicant shall have the right to present further evidence and to be heard, the final decision on issuance or renewal of a license shall be made by the compact commission pursuant to its established requirements. The compact commission shall have the power and duty to investigate license applicants and, as permitted by federal and state law, to gather information, including criminal history records from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and from state, local, and foreign country law enforcement agencies (including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), necessary to decide whether an applicant meets its license requirements.

       As used in this section, “interstate common wagering pool” means a pari-mutuel pool established in one (1) horse racing jurisdiction that is combined with comparable pari-mutuel pools from at least one (1) horse racing jurisdiction for the purpose of establishing payoff prices in the various jurisdictions.

       Interstate wagers at a receiving track may form an interstate common wagering pool with wagers at a track in another jurisdiction, and the receiving track may adopt the commission and breakage rates of the track at which the race is being run. The racing commission may also approve types of wagering, distribution of winnings, and rules of racing for interstate common wagering pools that are different from those that normally apply in Kentucky.

       A track’s participation in an interstate common wagering pool does not cause that track to be considered to be doing business in any jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction where the track is physically located. Excise taxes and commission rates may not be imposed on any interstate common wagering pool other than on amounts actually wagered in Kentucky. The combination of pari-mutuel pools as provided in this section constitutes the communication of wagering information for purposes of calculating odds and payoffs only and does not constitute the transfer of wagers in interstate commerce.

       In view of the fact that subsection (4) of this section gives the Kentucky Harness Racing Commission the power to fix the dates and conditions of the Kentucky Standardbred Development Fund races to be staged, and further in view of the fact that 811 KAR 1:200, § 13, directs that the Commission shall annually make provisions for the distribution of funds for stake races, it is exceedingly evident that the fund, if suddenly faced with the situation where only three tracks are to be awarded racing dates, may stage 24 races, staging 8 races at each of the three tracks which have been granted racing dates.<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-441</cite>.

     </h3>
     <p>
      As used in this chapter, “place of entertainment” means a roadhouse, place offering intoxicating or nonintoxicating drinks for sale, tourist camp or place of public entertainment at which people assemble to eat, drink, dance, bathe, or engage in any game or amusement, or any place having therein or thereon any person engaging in the practice of being a medium, clairvoyant, soothsayer, palmist, phrenologist, spiritualist, or like activity, or one who, with or without the use of cards, crystal ball, tea leaves, or any other object or device, engages in the practice of telling the fortune of another; but this last clause shall not be construed to apply to persons pretending to tell fortunes as part of any play, exhibition, fair or amateur show presented or offered by any religious, charitable, or benevolent institution. It shall not mean a private home at which bona fide guests are entertained, drive-in theaters, places of business conducted only as filling stations for motor vehicles or grocery stores, nor transient or temporary entertainment such as circuses, carnivals and county fairs.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The question of whether or not a go-cart business would require a permit rests within the sound discretion of the county judge, and he may or may not require a permit to operate such a business.<cite class=OAG>OAG 60-908</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An establishment which sells alcoholic beverages in the county outside an incorporated area can be required to have both a permit for a place of entertainment under KRS chapter 231 and an alcoholic beverage license under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.20.html#tXXc243s243.060" target="_blank">243.060</a></cite>.<cite class=OAG>OAG 67-46</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There must be only one place of entertainment license for each place of entertainment regardless of whether the activities permitted there satisfy only one definition of a place of entertainment or several.<cite class=OAG>OAG 67-46</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A grocery store which sells malt beverages by the package is not a “place of entertainment” within the meaning of this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 69-343</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A motor vehicle race track comes within the provisions of this section and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.020" target="_self">231.020</a></cite>.<cite class=OAG>OAG 71-539</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       National guard members who merely leased an armory to another party for a teenage dance would not be subject to prosecution for violation of this section and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.020" target="_self">231.020</a></cite>.<cite class=OAG>OAG 72-355</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some doubt that this section applies to the spasmodic and occasional leasing of premises to different lessees.<cite class=OAG>OAG 72-355</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An ordinance by a fiscal court imposing a license tax on operators of places of entertainment falling under the provisions of this section would be a valid revenue measure.<cite class=OAG>OAG 72-821</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an ordinance providing a license for operators of places of entertainment does not attempt to change the basic procedure and substantive provisions in the issuance of such permits or licenses by the county court as outlined in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.010" target="_self">231.010</a></cite> to<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.130" target="_self">231.130,</a></cite> the ordinance would be a valid exercise of the county’s police power.<cite class=OAG>OAG 72-821</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the police powers granted in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.083" target="_blank">67.083</a></cite>, it would appear that a fiscal court could enact an ordinance providing a license fee for those places of entertainment covered in this section, subject to the rule that the revenues cannot exceed the reasonable policing cost.<cite class=OAG>OAG 72-821</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no general exception from the requirement of licensing for charitable organizations operating places of entertainment.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-99</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An American Legion post that occasionally sponsors and occasionally leases its hall for dances and shows for high school students and adults would not be required to secure a permit from the county court as a place of entertainment.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-99</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An outdoor rock and roll music festival to be held on a county farm for two days would be temporary entertainment and thus the affair would not constitute a “place of entertainment.”<cite class=OAG>OAG 77-568</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Kentucky state trooper has the authority to investigate places of entertainment as defined by this section, even though state troopers are not specifically included under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.130" target="_self">231.130</a></cite>, since KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.130" target="_self">231.130</a></cite> and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc16s16.060" target="_blank">16.060</a></cite> read together make the state trooper a police officer with the equivalent authority of the county sheriff and the county police.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-77</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A grocery store owner in an unincorporated part of the county who has installed pool tables and arcade games must obtain a permit as required by KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.020" target="_self">231.020</a></cite> since the exception under this section for businesses conducted only as grocery stores clearly does not apply.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-40</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A health spa located outside corporate limits in a county and providing various forms of exercise must procure a permit under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.020" target="_self">231.020</a></cite> since, even though it promotes health, it also involves entertainment within the meaning of this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-82</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issuance of a permit, under this chapter, addresses itself to the exercise of a reasonable discretion on the part of the county judge/executive.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-82</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A place where a pin ball machine is located would normally be considered a “place of entertainment” and subject to the permit requirements of this chapter.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-510</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private or charitable clubs or organizations operating on a regular schedule and permanent basis and affording entertainment to their members of the kinds outlined in this section are required, in order to operate, to procure a permit, as provided in this chapter.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-112</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a private club does not actually sell any intoxicating drinks, i.e., where the intoxicating drinks are simply made available to members and their friends, without sale, such making available of alcoholic beverages would not qualify, on that factual basis, as a “place of entertainment.”<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-185</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the conversion from a public place of entertainment to a private club involves any of the activities described in this section, and if such activities to be engaged in by the private club were previously engaged in under its permit, then no new permit would be necessary unless the manager or owner who held the permit is changed; permits are issued to the manager or to the owner of a place of entertainment and it is the described activity or activities under this section and the identity of the manager or owner which are controlling, not the mere fact that the place of entertainment changes from a public to a private place.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-185</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a place of entertainment is rented or leased for one night by an individual for the purpose of a private party in which he plans to serve liquor or permit the guests to bring their own bottle, there is no violation of the statutes.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-185</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a private club does not offer alcoholic beverages for sale, nor engage in any described activities under this section, no permit is required; however, if a private club offers alcoholic beverages for sale in a county in which such sales are legal, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.110ol11" target="_self">231.110(1)</a></cite> would prohibit the permit holder from allowing drunken, disorderly or boisterous persons, etc., from congregating in or about such premises.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-185</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A roadhouse, which offers dancing and music, cannot be operated without a permit, according to this section; there are no statutory provisions for a temporary permit. The obtaining of a permit, by the owner or manager, is a condition precedent to its lawful operation. Such a place should not operate at all until a permit is obtained from the county judge/executive.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-368</cite>.

       If an applicant for a permit to operate a place of entertainment meets the qualifications prescribed by KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.030" target="_self">231.030</a></cite>, the permit must be granted and may be subject only to the restrictions authorized by statute, and the county judge is without authority to prohibit dancing in the establishment.<cite class=OAG>OAG 67-131</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kentucky National Guard, a state agency, or its agents cannot be required to obtain a permit under this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 72-355</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section apply to the manager of the entertainment facility.<cite class=OAG>OAG 72-355</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An American Legion post that occasionally sponsors and occasionally leases its hall for dances and shows for high school students and adults would not be required to secure a permit from the county court as a place of entertainment.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-99</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the function of conducting hearings and granting permits to operate certain places of entertainment in the unincorporated portions of a county is at most only quasi-judicial, the county judge/executive was intended by the legislature to continue in performing that local function.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-33</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An entertainment permit, once granted to a particular individual under this chapter, cannot be transferred to a new owner or manager of the place of entertainment.<cite class=OAG>OAG 80-429</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A permit issued pursuant to this section may be issued only to an individual human being, since KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.030" target="_self">231.030</a></cite> requires a permit holder to be of good moral character and an artificial entity has no good moral character.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-82</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A health spa located outside corporate limits in a county and providing various forms of exercise must procure a permit under this section since, even though it promotes health, it also involves entertainment within the meaning of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.010" target="_self">231.010</a></cite>.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-82</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A grocery store owner in an unincorporated part of the county who has installed pool tables and arcade games must obtain a permit as required by this section since the exception under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.010" target="_self">231.010</a></cite> for businesses conducted only as grocery stores clearly does not apply.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-40</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no provisions in this chapter which authorized the Attorney General’s office to grant permission to someone to operate a place of entertainment as that is the function of the county judge/executive. There are no provisions authorizing the county clerk’s office to change or amend the application for a permit to operate a place of entertainment to include pin ball machines when the application does not indicate that particular kind of a place of entertainment.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-510</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no statutes authorizing the county judge/executive, in issuing an entertainment permit, to impose express and specific conditions, such as the volume level (decibels) of music played in the place of entertainment.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-100</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.030" target="_self">231.030</a></cite> was not intended to list the exclusive factors to be considered in the issuing of an entertainment permit, and the county judge/executive has a reasonable discretion in the issuing or not issuing of a permit. The county judge/executive can consider all relevent facts and evidence which reasonably relate to the issuing of a permit, bearing in mind that the public interest must be carefully weighed in the process.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-100</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the holder of an entertainment permit leaves the place of entertainment for which he holds a permit, his permit can in no way be transferred to another person. Thus, the permit would be ineffective as to its use by a different individual who wishes to operate the same place of entertainment.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-100</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private or charitable clubs or organizations operating on a regular schedule and permanent basis and affording entertainment to their members of the kinds outlined in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.010" target="_self">231.010</a></cite> are required, in order to operate, to procure a permit, as provided in this chapter.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-112</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a private club does not offer alcoholic beverages for sale, nor engage in any described activities under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.010" target="_self">231.010</a></cite>, no permit is required; however, if a private club offers alcoholic beverages for sale in a county in which such sales are legal, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.110ol11" target="_self">231.110(1)</a></cite> would prohibit the permit holder from allowing drunken, disorderly or boisterous persons, etc., from congregating in or about such premises.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-185</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       No permit can be issued under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.010" target="_self">231.010</a></cite>, et seq., where alcoholic beverages are for sale in a dry county; the permit does not envision the violation of any law, ABC or otherwise.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-185</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the conversion from a public place of entertainment to a private club involves any of the activities described in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.010" target="_self">231.010</a></cite>, and if such activities to be engaged in by the private club were previously engaged in under its permit, then no new permit would be necessary unless the manager or owner who held the permit is changed; permits are issued to the manager or to the owner of a place of entertainment and it is the described activity or activities under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc231s231.010" target="_self">231.010</a></cite> and the identity of the manager or owner which are controlling, not the mere fact that the place of entertainment changes from a public to a private place.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-185</cite>.

     <p>
      No person shall own or operate a nudist society unless he first secures a license from the county judge/executive in the county in which the nudist society will be located. Any person who desires a license shall file an application with the county clerk setting forth the name and address of the owner of the premises upon which the nudist society will be located and the name of the operator, the occupation of the owner or operator, the reason for forming the society and its purpose, the location of the area of the proposed nudist society, and a description of the physical facilities and precautions to be taken which will assure privacy of members and concealment and reasonable isolation of the nudists from the public. If the county judge/executive finds that the character of the applicant is good, the nudist society is proposed to be conducted for religious or health purposes, the facilities appear adequate and the nudist society will be so located or screened or housed, and so operated, as to give reasonable assurance that its activities will be effectively concealed and its members reasonably isolated from the ordinary view and presence of the general public, the county judge/executive shall issue the license upon payment of a fee of one hundred dollars ($100). Each license to operate a nudist society shall expire one (1) year from issuance but may be renewed annually upon payment of a renewal fee of fifty dollars ($50).

        The term “prostitution” has meant, for centuries, the commercial gratification of sexual desires. Chambers v. Commonwealth, 723 S.W.2d 868, 1986<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 1467</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though “prostitution” is not defined in this chapter, the definition in the penal code was appropriately relied upon by the trial court in characterizing the conduct at the establishments (manual stimulation of male patrons by female waitresses in exchange for the purchase of drinks which each cost from $16 to $55) as prostitution. Chambers v. Commonwealth, 723 S.W.2d 868, 1986<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 1467</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).

      If the complaint is filed by a citizen, it shall be dismissed only upon a sworn statement by the relator and his attorney, setting forth the reasons why the action should be dismissed. Dismissal shall be approved by the Commonwealth’s or county attorney in writing or in open court. If the court is of the opinion that the action ought not to be dismissed, it may direct the Commonwealth’s or county attorney to prosecute the action to judgment. If an action is continued more than one (1) month, any citizen may be substituted for the relator and prosecute the action to judgment. If the action is brought by a citizen, and the court finds there was no reasonable ground for the action, the costs may be taxed to that citizen.

        Trial court did not err in giving a sudden emergency jury instruction in a case where the claimant and the alleged tortfeasor were operating personal water crafts on a lake, the claimant was a few feet ahead of the alleged tortfeasor, and the claimant abruptly and without warning turned the claimant’s personal water craft to the left, right in the path of the alleged tortfeasor’s personal water craft; the claimant had a duty pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc235s235.285ol14" target="_self">235.285(4)</a></cite> to operate the claimant’s water craft in a reasonable and prudent manner so as not to endanger human life, human physical safety, and property, and failed to do so by suddenly turning the claimant’s personal water craft in front of the alleged tortfeasor’s personal water craft.

        The definition of firearm in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc237s237.060" target="_self">237.060</a></cite> is in contrast to the federal firearm enhancement for drug offenses where the relevant statutory definition of firearm explicitly includes weapons designed to eject projectiles by explosive action or weapons that can be converted to eject projectiles by explosive action, as well as those that actually will eject projectiles by explosive action. Although the gun must be able to shoot projectiles, there is no indication in the statutory definition that the weapon must be loaded to qualify as a firearm. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 260 S.W.3d 792, 2008<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 177</cite> (Ky. 2008).

The Department of Kentucky State Police shall attempt to secure from each other state permission for Kentucky residents who hold a valid Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license to carry concealed deadly weapons in that state, either on the basis of the Kentucky license or on the basis that the Kentucky license is sufficient to permit the issuance of a similar license by the other state. The Department of Kentucky State Police shall enter into a written reciprocity agreement with the appropriate agency in each state that agrees to permit Kentucky residents to carry concealed deadly weapons in the other state on the basis of a Kentucky-issued concealed deadly weapon license or that will issue a license to carry concealed deadly weapons in the other state based upon a Kentucky concealed deadly weapon license. If a reciprocity agreement is reached, the requirement to recontact the other state each twelve (12) months shall be eliminated as long as the reciprocity agreement is in force. The information shall be a public record and shall be available to individual requesters free of charge for the first copy and at the normal rate for open records requests for additional copies.

        The statute does not require that any employee who carries a concealed weapon on the premises be terminated; instead, it actually creates a right to carry concealed weapons upon proper licensing, and subsection (14) (see now (17)) is an exception to that general right.

        University employee established that his discharge was contrary to a fundamental and well-defined public policy, i.e., the right to bear arms, as evidenced by the Kentucky Revised Statutes. Further, an explicit legislative statement prohibited the employee’s discharge, and the reason for the employee’s discharge was his exercise of a right conferred by well-established legislative enactments.

       Neither a fiscal court nor its county judge executive, or any other local official, can ban the possession or carrying in a public park the open or concealed carrying of firearms, except the fiscal court, which if it properly passes an ordinance, may prohibit or limit the carrying of concealed firearms in park buildings or portions thereof owned, leased or controlled by it.<cite class=OAG>OAG 96-39</cite>.

       While subsection (1) of this section recognizes the right of colleges and universities to control possession of deadly weapons, generally, on their properties, subsection (1) of this section limits other units of state government, city governments, county governments, urban-county governments, and charter county governments to prohibiting only the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The Kentucky General Assembly, therefore, has recognized that the governing board of a college or university of this Commonwealth has a right to control the possession of all deadly weapons on its properties, regardless of whether the weapons are concealed or carried openly.<cite class=OAG>OAG 96-40</cite>.

      The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky hereby declares that charitable gaming conducted by charitable organizations is an important method of raising funds for legitimate charitable purposes and is in the public interest. The purpose of this chapter is to comply with constitutional requirements by establishing an effective and efficient mechanism for regulating charitable gaming which includes defining the scope of charitable gaming activities, setting standards for the conduct of charitable gaming which insure honesty and integrity, providing for means of accounting for all moneys generated through the conduct of charitable gaming, and providing for suitable penalties for violations of laws and administrative regulations. The intent of this chapter is to prevent the commercialization of charitable gaming, to prevent participation in charitable gaming by criminal and other undesirable elements, and to prevent the diversion of funds from legitimate charitable purposes. In order to carry out the purpose and intent, the provisions of this chapter, and any administrative regulations promulgated in accordance with this chapter, shall be construed in the public interest and strictly enforced.

       <p>
        Provisions of this section requiring gross receipts from charitable gambling to be handled only by bona fide officers and employees of the charitable organization and limiting rent and other expenses are rationally related to the state’s interest in ensuring that receipts from charitable gaming are actually applied to charitable works and are therefore constitutional; nor is subsection (5) overbroad, since no constitutionally protected conduct is prohibited. Commonwealth v. Louisville Atlantis Community/Adapt, 971 S.W.2d 810, 1997<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 86</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement to retain 40% of adjusted gross receipts is not clearly unreasonable because the Commonwealth has an express and legitimate interest in insuring that gaming receipts are used for solely charitable purposes and that they are not unwisely or improperly diverted, and the requirement that a significant portion of adjusted gross gaming receipts be retained and accounted for by the charity is rationally related to this state objective. Pigeons' Roost v. Commonwealth, 10 S.W.3d 133, 1999<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 56</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1999).

       A licensed charitable gaming facility shall execute a lease agreement with each licensed charitable organization that desires to conduct charitable gaming at the facility. The licensed charitable gaming facility shall agree in the lease to provide gaming space, utilities, insurance for the premises, parking, tables and chairs, and other nongaming equipment necessary for the conduct of charitable gaming, adequate storage space, security, and janitorial services. The costs of the goods and services provided shall be itemized in the lease. A licensed charitable organization may elect to provide for itself any of the goods and services that a charitable gaming facility is required to provide under this subsection, provided these arrangements are clearly noted in the lease agreement, and provided the total compensation to be paid the charitable gaming facility is reduced commensurate with the cost of the goods and services as itemized in the lease. The amount of rent, goods, and services charged shall be reasonable and shall be based on prevailing market values in the general locality for the goods and services to be provided. Rent shall not be based in whole or in part, on a percentage of gross receipts or net proceeds derived from the conduct of charitable gaming or by reference to the number of people in attendance. The department by administrative regulation may establish standards for the determination of prevailing market values. A copy of each signed lease agreement shall be filed with the department.

    A fee is imposed on charitable gaming in the amount of fifty-three hundredths of one percent (0.53%) of gross receipts derived from all charitable gaming conducted by charitable organizations required to be licensed in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The amount of the fee shall be adjusted by October 1 of each odd-numbered year in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. Each licensed charitable organization shall remit to the department all moneys due as set forth in administrative regulations promulgated by the department. Failure by a licensed charitable organization to timely remit the fee required under this subsection upon notice of delinquency shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action in accordance with KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXIXc238s238.560" target="_self">238.560</a></cite>.

The new rate shall be calculated by multiplying one hundred ten percent (110%) by the amount determined in paragraph (a)2. of this subsection, and subtracting from that amount one-half (1/2) of any remaining balance in the account. The total shall then be divided by the amount determined in paragraph (a)1. of this subsection.
