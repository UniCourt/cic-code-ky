       KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc44s44.020" target="_blank">44.020</a></cite> applies to this section which pertains to a mileage allowance for Kentucky witnesses in circuit and district courts.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-336</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.250" target="_self">421.250</a></cite> is impliedly repealed by this section as relates to the mileage factor.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-620</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is broad enough to encompass nonresident, as well as resident, witnesses in felony cases as to the mileage factor where privately owned conveyance is used.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-620</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding mileage fee for nonresident witness in a felony case, this section, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.030" target="_self">421.030</a></cite> and<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.250" target="_self">421.250(</a></cite>2) must be read together under the doctrine of in pari materia. Thus a nonresident witness, residing in a state which has adopted the Uniform Witness Act, and who is certified as a material witness for a Kentucky court felony case, is entitled to the mileage of 18 cents per mile where a privately owned vehicle is used or where the witness elects to travel by some other means, including air, except that the 18 cents per mile payment cannot exceed airplane coach fare; in addition, under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.250" target="_self">421.250(</a></cite>2), such witness is entitled to the $5.00 per diem and under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.030" target="_self">421.030</a></cite>, such witness is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable lodging, food, tolls and taxi fares.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-620</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the ordinary level of reimbursement of travel expenses to be afforded nonresident material witnesses in felony cases, the Commonwealth must pay, as part of the necessary expenses of a witness, that amount required by the law of another state (one adopting the Uniform Witness Act) to be tendered in advance to a nonresident witness, as a prerequisite to issuance of its subpoena requiring a witness to travel to and give testimony in Kentucky.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-620</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While this section refers narrowly to a mileage allowance for witnesses in court, under the doctrine of in pari materia, i.e., reading the related statutes together, witnesses who must travel to another county for appearance in circuit court would be entitled to the mileage allowance given state employees, and would be entitled to reimbursement for their necessary food and lodging costs as authorized in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc44s44.060" target="_blank">44.060</a></cite>,<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45s45.101" target="_blank">45.101,</a></cite><cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45s45.180" target="_blank">45.180</a></cite> (repealed) and this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-117</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Former employees of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, including the Office of the State Medical Examiner and of the Kentucky State Police Laboratory, are not entitled under Kentucky law to hourly compensation when subpoenaed to testify in a case arising from their duties while employed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky.<cite class=OAG>OAG 2009-005</cite>.

      A Commonwealth’s witness in a felony case who resides in another state shall be allowed his necessary expenses in addition to the per diem, but no such allowance shall be made unless the judge of the court has made an order based upon the personal knowledge of the Circuit Judge or upon information showing that the testimony of the witness is material to the state, requiring the attendance of the witness. The expense and per diem shall be allowed by the Circuit Court and certified to the circuit clerk for payment.

       KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc44s44.020" target="_blank">44.020</a></cite> applies to this section which relates to nonresident prosecutorial witness expenses in felony cases.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-336</cite>.

      <p>
       Regarding mileage fee for a nonresident witness in a felony case, this section, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.015" target="_self">421.015</a></cite> and<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.250" target="_self">421.250(</a></cite>2) must be read together under the doctrine of pari materia. Thus a nonresident witness, residing in a state which has adopted the Uniform Witness Act, and who is certified as a material witness for a Kentucky court felony case, is entitled to the mileage of 18 cents per mile where a privately owned vehicle is used, or where the witness elects to travel by some other means, including air, except that the 18 cents per mile payment cannot exceed airplane coach fare; in addition, under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.250" target="_self">421.250(</a></cite>2), such witness is entitled to the $5.00 per diem and under this section, such witness is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable lodging, food, tolls and taxifares.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-620</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the ordinary level of reimbursement of travel expenses to be afforded nonresident material witnesses in felony cases, the Commonwealth must pay, as part of the necessary expenses of a witness, that amount required by the law of another state (one adopting the Uniform Witness Act) to be tendered in advance to a nonresident witness, as a prerequisite to issuance of its subpoena requiring a witness to travel to and give testimony in Kentucky.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-620</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Former employees of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, including the Office of the State Medical Examiner and of the Kentucky State Police Laboratory, are not entitled under Kentucky law to hourly compensation when subpoenaed to testify in a case arising from their duties while employed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky.<cite class=OAG>OAG 2009-005</cite>.

     <p>
      Each witness for the Commonwealth in a felony case shall, immediately after he testifies claim his attendance in open court. The claim may be allowed by the court and if it is allowed it shall be noted of record. Any person who has been subpoenaed or recognized as a witness in a felony case who fails to appear upon the calling of the case, is not entitled to claim as a witness in that case unless he files an affidavit from which it appears that he had a good excuse for failing to attend. When the affidavit is filed the court may allow the witness to claim his attendance. The clerk shall note on his order book the name of each witness who fails to attend the first day of the trial.

        Court rejected defendant’s argument that his opportunity to controvert the contents of a presentence investigation (PSI) report pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc532s532.050" target="_blank">532.050</a></cite> applied to a victim impact statement pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.520" target="_self">421.520</a></cite> so as to afford him the opportunity to also controvert the contents of a victim impact statement because, unlike KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc532s532.050" target="_blank">532.050</a></cite>, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.520" target="_self">421.520</a></cite> did not specifically afford a defendant an opportunity to controvert the contents of a victim impact statement. Although KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.520" target="_self">421.520</a></cite>(1) permits a victim impact statement to be included in a PSI report or submitted by itself if a defendant waives the PSI report, nothing in either statute suggests that the rules governing challenges to PSI reports also apply to victim impact statements; absent such a provision or case law supporting such an application, the trial court did not err by declining to afford defendant such an opportunity.

        In libel action against newspaper on grounds that it negligently and with reckless disregard for the truth published false and defamatory statements, trial court’s discovery order, which required reporters to furnish copies of their notes in lieu of the original notes, while permitting them to delete from such copies the portions that referred solely to matters other than the issues raised by the allegations of the complaint, and permitted a further hearing whenever there was doubt as to whether further material should or should not be deleted, was proper, even though newspaper asserted that privilege against disclosure existed by virtue of freedom of the press as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Ky.

        Courts may go beyond the powers expressed or defined by the statutes in cases of civil contempt, and this certainly is so in relation to the exercise of powers not embraced within the expressed limitations.

        Where the existence or nonexistence of a contempt, civil or criminal, requires the resolution of a factual issue, the trial court may itself resolve that issue upon the basis of a hearing in which the alleged offender is afforded a fair opportunity to present a defense, but the trial court may not in such a case inflict a fine greater than $500 and incarceration for more than six months except upon the unanimous verdict of a jury finding the offender guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

        The criminal division of the Circuit Court was not deprived of jurisdiction to deal with contempt by a disobedient or recalcitrant witness within the age of the juvenile court’s jurisdiction for refusal to answer questions in a grand jury investigation before the Circuit Court to determine whether an indictment should be returned against her father for a homicide committed while the witness and her father were in an automobile with the person killed.

        Where the defendant refused two (2) orders of the court to be sworn and testify in the same case on occasions separated by less than two (2) hours, there was one continuing contempt on the part of the defendant rather than a separate contempt for each refusal.

        An attorney’s obligation of loyalty and duty to his client does not extend so far as to justify advising a continuing course of defiance and contumacious disobedience of court orders, and when an attorney aids in the evasion of an order of the court, or incites others to such conduct, he is equally, if not more, guilty of contempt of court than is his client.

        Although contempt proceedings do not lie for perjury except where the truth of the facts or the falsity of the evidence is judicially known, the trial court has to find defendant’s testimony false in order to inflict punishment for a contempt that is dependent on the premise that the party allegedly in contempt is not telling the truth.

      When a felony case has been called, and either party is not ready for trial because a witness who has been duly subpoenaed and has failed to appear is not in the county in which the court is sitting, the Circuit Judge may appoint a special bailiff, who shall have power to arrest and bring the witness immediately before the court. The bailiff shall be allowed by the judge a reasonable compensation for the service, not to exceed that allowed to sheriffs for conveying prisoners to the penitentiary.

        This section is unconstitutional in that it binds the hands of the trial court by restricting the duration of imprisonment to the pendency of the trial; witnesses cannot be allowed to freely refuse requests of the court with the certainty that their penalty will be of limited duration.

        A notary public authorized by a commission from the court of another state to take depositions in this state for use in an action pending in such court is without authority to issue a subpoena duces tecum compelling a witness to produce before such notary books or documents for inspection or as evidence, and being without such authority, his action declaring such witness in contempt for refusing to produce the books or documents, and attempting to punish him therefor, was illegal and void; nor can such action of the notary be given any legal force or effect by any order that may be entered by the judge of the county court in approval thereof.

        Where the existence or nonexistence of a contempt, civil or criminal, requires the resolution of a factual issue, the trial court may itself resolve that issue upon the basis of a hearing in which the alleged offender is afforded a fair opportunity to present a defense, but trial court may not in such a case inflict a fine greater than $500 and incarceration for more than six (6) months except upon the unanimous verdict of a jury finding the offender guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Miller v. Vettiner, 481 S.W.2d 32, 1972<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 210</cite> (Ky. 1972) (decision prior to 1976 amendment).

       <p>
        Although contempt proceedings do not lie for perjury except where the truth of the facts or the falsity of the evidence is judicially known, the trial court has to find defendant’s testimony false in order to inflict punishment for a contempt that is dependent on the premise that the party allegedly in contempt is not telling the truth.

        Since the order imposing conditional imprisonment was obviously for the purpose of compelling the contemnor to testify in the felony prosecution of two defendants, the rendition of a guilty verdict against the two (2) defendants and the discharge of the jury constituted a final disposition of the prosecution so as to discharge the contemnor from his imprisonment for contempt. Hardin v. Summitt, 627 S.W.2d 580, 1982<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 228</cite> (Ky. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The justification for imprisonment under this section depends upon the ability of the contemnor to comply with the court’s order and it is untenable to suggest that the term “final disposition” as used in this section requires a contemnor to remain incarcerated during the pendency of an appellate process which may continue for several years.

        Where, in an action instituted in Henry Circuit Court to recover damages against the defendant corporation for violation of contract in which summons was served upon chief officer of the corporation who was in Henry County voluntarily attending court as a witness, and the lower court overruled a motion to quash the service of summons and case was tried upon the merits, in urging a reversal of the judgment, the defendant contended the court erred in overruling its motion to quash the service of summons, the appellate court in affirming the decision of the lower court stated the statute is not applicable and does not prevent service of summons in an action against a corporation on an officer of the corporation voluntarily attending court as a witness.

       This section (C.C. 607: trans. Acts 1952, ch. 84, § 1) was repealed by § 92 of Acts 1990, ch. 88 to contingently become effective as provided by § 93 of Acts 1990, ch. 88. However, § 93 of Acts 1990, ch. 88 was repealed by § 30 of Acts 1992, ch. 324, effective July 1, 1992. Therefore the repeal of this section by § 92 of Acts 1990, ch. 88 became effective July 1, 1992.

        In prosecution for having liquor for sale in local option territory, comment by prosecutor that defendant had not taken stand and explained to what institutions the liquor was to be furnished violated this section and required reversal of the judgment. Hicks v. Commonwealth, 311<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 492</cite>, 224 S.W.2d 916, 1949<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 1198</cite> (Ky. 1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution as a habitual criminal, comment by the Commonwealth’s Attorney that no witness had taken the stand to deny the identity of the defendant as the same person who had been previously convicted did not violate this section. Foster v. Commonwealth, 415 S.W.2d 373, 1966<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 7</cite> (Ky. 1966), cert. denied, 388 U.S. 914, 87 S. Ct. 2128, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1355, 1967 U.S. LEXIS 1175 (U.S. 1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remark by prosecutor that evidence for the state was uncontradicted was not improper as drawing attention to the failure of defendant to testify. Fanelli v. Commonwealth, 418 S.W.2d 740, 1967<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 229</cite> (Ky. 1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though in summation to the jury the prosecutor at one point commented on defendant’s failure to testify, the other evidence was so overwhelming that any constitutional violation of the privilege against self-incrimination was not prejudicial. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 503 S.W.2d 485, 1972<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 3</cite> (Ky. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Argument that a defendant has failed to contradict the prosecutor’s evidence has been upheld as a proper form of argument; accordingly, comments by a prosecutor which did not directly refer to the defendant’s failure to testify, but only referred to the fact that the defense did not put on any witnesses at all, were a proper form of argument. Haynes v. Commonwealth, 657 S.W.2d 948, 1983<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 283</cite> (Ky. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Comment on the failure to testify must be manifestly intended to reflect on the accused’s silence or of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it as such, to constitute prejudice. Bagby v. Sowders, 894 F.2d 792, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 484 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 929, 110 S. Ct. 2626, 110 L. Ed. 2d 646, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 3101 (U.S. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no indication of an extraordinary case in which a constitutional violation had probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, the petitioner’s argument that the prosecutor’s comment during closing argument violated his privilege against self-incrimination was barred by procedural default, in the absence of a contemporaneous objection. Bagby v. Sowders, 894 F.2d 792, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 484 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 929, 110 S. Ct. 2626, 110 L. Ed. 2d 646, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 3101 (U.S. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Murder conviction was reversed based on a prosecutor’s comment on defendant’s failure to tell police where a shot was fired from because the reference was clearly to the failure to testify at trial since such a question was not asked during police interrogation; the record showed that the proof of defendant’s guilt was not overwhelming, defense counsel objected, and the trial court failed to cure the error. Ragland v. Commonwealth, 2004<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 284</cite> (Ky. Nov. 18, 2004).

        Where criminal defendant declined to request separate trial, incriminating testimony of codefendants was competent. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 403 S.W.2d 36, 1966<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 322</cite> (Ky. 1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a codefendant’s attorney may not comment on the accused’s failure to testify, the possibility of such comment does not constitute a ground for separate trial. Luttrell v. Commonwealth, 554 S.W.2d 75, 1977<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 482</cite> (Ky. 1977).

       <p>
        Where accused at close of the case for Commonwealth requested the court for permission to testify after all other defense witnesses had testified, court’s ruling that if he desired to testify his testimony would have to be given first did not violate the constitutional right of defendant either in forcing or depriving him of his right to remain silent. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 474 S.W.2d 107, 1971<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 94</cite> (Ky. 1971) (decision prior to 1974 amendment).

        This section makes it optional with the defendant whether he testifies or not, and he is entitled to an instruction on his failure to testify only if he requests it. Spencer v. Commonwealth, 467 S.W.2d 128, 1971<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 354</cite> (Ky. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of defendant’s right to testify at her trial for lighting herself and her children on fire, resulting in the death of one of the children, was reversible error where defendant was competent to stand trial, where the right was fundamental, personal, and was not waived by her, and where she was prejudiced by the denial of that right because the trial court was forced to gag her and forcibly drag her form the courtroom in the presence of the jury because defendant was disruptive in trying to assert her right to testify. Even though the collective efforts of the trial court, prosecutors and defendant’s own attorneys was to prevent defendant from harming herself by taking the stand and attempting to commit suicide by insuring she would receive the death penalty, the trial court still had to grant defendant the right to tell her story in her own words. Quarels v. Commonwealth, 142 S.W.3d 73, 2004<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 186</cite> (Ky. 2004).

        Where trial judge refused a defendant’s request to instruct the jury that defendant was not compelled to testify, that the fact that he did not testify could not be used as an inference of guilt, and that failure to testify should not prejudice him in any way, such refusal violated defendant’s privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, since the trial judge has a constitutional obligation, upon proper request, to minimize the danger that the jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant’s failure to testify, and granting the requested jury instruction would not have required the trial judge to “comment upon” the defendant’s failure to testify as prohibited by this section. Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U.S. 288, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241, 1981 U.S. LEXIS 77 (U.S. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the defendant requested the trial court to instruct the jury that no inference of guilt should be drawn from defendant’s failure to testify, the trial court was justified in refusing to give the instruction because the giving of the instruction would be a direct “comment” within the meaning of this section and would have emphasized the fact that the accused had not testified in his own behalf. Green v. Commonwealth, 488 S.W.2d 339, 1972<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 39</cite> (Ky. 1972).

        The former section providing that a defendant could not testify after any other defense witness, as applied to a case in which none of the other witnesses offered any testimony helpful to the defense, was not unconstitutional. Burch v. Commonwealth, 555 S.W.2d 954, 1977<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 517</cite> (Ky. 1977) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Although a trial court incorrectly informed defendant that, if he testified in his rape prosecution differently from what he told his attorney during the trial with respect to the issue of force and penetration, he could be prosecuted for perjury, defendant was not deprived of his right to testify on his own behalf as the error was harmless, in that it was highly improbable under the circumstances of the case that competent defense counsel would have advised his client to testify and highly improbable that a well-advised defendant would have elected to present defendant’s testimony. Moreover, there was no claim that defendant was dissuaded from taking the stand because of the judge’s comments. Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, 339 S.W.3d 411, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 64</cite> (Ky. 2011).

        Unpublished decision:
    Commonwealth’s resort to the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Within or Without a State in Criminal Proceedings, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.230" target="_self">421.230</a></cite> to<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.270" target="_self">421.270,</a></cite> is not always required in order to satisfy the “good faith effort” requirement of the Confrontation Clause or the “reasonable means” requirement of KRE. 804(a)(5); while an unsuccessful resort to the Uniform Act may well satisfy the test for unavailability of a witness, failure to do so is not conclusive of the contrary, especially where there is evidence that resort to the Act would be futile.

        Circuit court properly dismissed defendant's petition for an out-of-state subpoena for witnesses and evidence from the manufacturer of a breathalyzer because a certificate and order from a Georgia court were facially defective where neither contained a seal of the Georgia court or specified when any witness was to appear in the Georgia proceeding, defendant had alternative means to test the machine, it would be an undue hardship for the manufacturer to produce the machine's source code without a protective order, a hearing was not necessary due to the defective order, and the subpoena was nothing but a classic fishing expedition.

        There was no abuse of discretion in the court’s denying the defendant a continuance because of the absence of a witness who was in the penitentiary where the defendant did not seek to procure his attendance under the law nor make an attempt to take his deposition.

       Subsection (2) of this section was not intended to authorize the state’s payment for defense witness expenses.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-682</cite>.

       If a witness who is not within the territory of the United States attends to testify in a criminal proceeding in the State, his transportation expenses would not be authorized under this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 77-570</cite>.

       This section, which provides for procuring prosecuting witnesses from other states but does not cover defense witnesses, involves court action and thus KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc44s44.020" target="_blank">44.020</a></cite> applies.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-336</cite>.

       Regarding mileage fee for a nonresident witness in a felony case, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.015" target="_self">421.015</a></cite>,<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.030" target="_self">421.030</a></cite> and subdivision (2) of this section must be read together under the doctrine of pari materia. Thus a nonresident witness, residing in a state which has adopted the Uniform Witness Act, and who is certified as a material witness for a Kentucky court felony case, is entitled to the mileage of 18 cents per mile where a privately owned vehicle is used, or where the witness elects to travel by some other means, including air, except that the 18 cents per mile payment cannot exceed airplane coach fare; in addition, under subdivision (2) of this section, such witness is entitled to the $5.00 per diem and under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.030" target="_self">421.030</a></cite>, such witness is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable lodging, food, tools and taxifares.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-620</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the ordinary level of reimbursement of travel expenses to be afforded nonresident material witnesses in felony cases, the Commonwealth must pay, as part of the necessary expenses of a witness, that amount required by the law of another state (one adopting the Uniform Witness Act) to be tendered in advance to a nonresident witness, as a prerequisite to issuance of its subpoena requiring a witness to travel to and give testimony in Kentucky.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-620</cite>.

        Although it was error under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.260ol11" target="_self">421.260(1)</a></cite> for an out-of-state witness to have been arrested while she was present in Kentucky to testify in a trial, there was no evidence that the witness was threatened with prosecution by the Commonwealth relative to her testimony at defendant’s trial or that the testimony of the witness was in any way coerced by the Commonwealth. Accordingly, the error was not a structural error that affected the entire framework of the trial, but a trial error which did not require reversal under RCr 10.26 in the context of other evidence presented.

       <p>
        The limited provisions of subsections (3) and (4) of this section as they apply to child witnesses 12 years of age or younger who are the victims of sex abuse are constitutional, as they do not deny the right of confrontation by a defendant as protected by Ky. Const., § 11 and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution nor do they violate the separation of powers doctrine as provided by Ky. Const., §§ 28 and 109. Commonwealth v. Willis, 716 S.W.2d 224, 1986<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 281</cite> (Ky. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (2) of this section does not violate a defendant’s constitutional right to confront witnesses, nor does it unconstitutionally infringe upon the inherent powers of the judiciary. Eastman v. Commonwealth, 720 S.W.2d 348, 1986<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 1478</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant’s right of confrontation secured to him under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as well as Ky. Const., § 11, was not violated by the trial court’s utilization of the procedure set forth in this section, where the defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine the victim and to determine whether such statements were reliable. Eastman v. Commonwealth, 720 S.W.2d 348, 1986<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 1478</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, which permits testimony from a child who has not been declared by the trial court competent to testify as a witness, is an unconstitutional infringement on the inherent powers of the judiciary, as declared in Ky. Const., §§ 27 and 28, and since this section authorizes a child to be a witness without first having undertaken a solemn obligation to tell the truth, it is a legislative interference with the orderly administration of justice. Gaines v. Commonwealth, 728 S.W.2d 525, 1987<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 196</cite> (Ky. 1987).

       <p>
        When a child witness is too frightened or inarticulate to allow any significant examination, even at a competency hearing, then a finding of unavailability and the use of televised testimony may be justified. Commonwealth v. Willis, 716 S.W.2d 224, 1986<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 281</cite> (Ky. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether to permit the use of television cameras to present the testimony in a sex abuse proceeding of a victim under the age of 12, the trial court must have wide discretion to consider the age and demeanor of the child witness, the nature of the offense and the likely impact of testimony in court or facing the defendant. Commonwealth v. Willis, 716 S.W.2d 224, 1986<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 281</cite> (Ky. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In making a compelling need determination under this section, especially when the child is older than 12, the court should consider the age of the victim and the time that has elapsed from the crime to the date of trial. Danner v. Commonwealth, 963 S.W.2d 632, 1998<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 19</cite> (Ky.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1010, 119 S. Ct. 529, 142 L. Ed. 2d 439, 1998 U.S. LEXIS 7271 (U.S. 1998).

       <p>
        Subsections (3), (4), and (5) of this section permitting the use of television cameras to present the testimony in a sex abuse prosecution of a victim under the age of 12 are not automatic but instead rest in the sound discretion of the trial judge; if the prosecution is unable to show any necessity for use of these subsections, it could be an abuse of discretion to grant a motion over defense objection. Commonwealth v. Willis, 716 S.W.2d 224, 1986<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 281</cite> (Ky. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not an abuse of discretion in a sodomy prosecution to allow the 15-year-old victim to testify by means of closed circuit television, where the daughter of the defendant was the alleged victim when she was between five (5) and ten (10), and the court found that requiring her to present her testimony in open court would inhibit her to the degree that the jury’s search for the truth would be clouded. Danner v. Commonwealth, 963 S.W.2d 632, 1998<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 19</cite> (Ky.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1010, 119 S. Ct. 529, 142 L. Ed. 2d 439, 1998 U.S. LEXIS 7271 (U.S. 1998).

         5. Videotaped Testimony Equivalent of Court Testimony.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The videotaped or televised testimony under subsections (3) or (4) of this section is not hearsay; it is the functional equivalent of testimony in court because the testimony is taken with the court, counsel and the defendant present in person, full cross-examination is authorized, and the defendant and the jury can see and hear the witness and assess credibility by observation of the demeanor of the witness. Commonwealth v. Willis, 716 S.W.2d 224, 1986<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 281</cite> (Ky. 1986).

        The privilege of viewing a witness through a one-way mirror or a video monitor is a constitutionally acceptable substitute for face-to-face confrontation. Commonwealth v. Willis, 716 S.W.2d 224, 1986<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 281</cite> (Ky. 1986).

        Inmate’s Confrontation Clause rights were not violated when his allegedly sexually abused daughter, though age 15, testified against him via closed circuit per KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.350" target="_self">421.350</a></cite>. The trial court’s compelling need determination was supported by its findings that her reliability was at stake, and that the inmate was the cause of her distress, which was not de minimis. Danner v. Motley, 448 F.3d 372, 2006 FED App. 0159P, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 11681 (6th Cir.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 2006</cite>).

       <p>
        Trial court’s granting of prosecutor’s request to stand between two children testifying about the attack on their mother and defendant violated KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.350" target="_self">421.350</a></cite> because the trial court did not make a finding that there was a “compelling need” to impair defendant’s view of those witnesses. Even though the trial court’s decision also violated defendant’s Sixth Amendment and Ky. Const. § 11 confrontation clause right to view witnesses, the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the two children were not key witnesses and other compelling evidence supported the mother’s version of defendant’s attack on her. Sparkman v. Commonwealth, 250 S.W.3d 667, 2008<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 106</cite> (Ky. 2008).

        Court of Appeals of Kentucky rejects the contention that compliance with Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 26A.140 necessarily requires implementation of the procedures set forth in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.350" target="_self">421.350.</a></cite> The legislature has had ample opportunity to amend § 26A.140 if it intended the phrase procedures shall be used to shield children from visual contact with alleged perpetrator to mean compliance with §<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.350" target="_self">421.350,</a></cite> or to amend §<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.350" target="_self">421.350</a></cite> to reference § 26A.140. The Court of Appeals can only interpret the plain meaning of the words, which do not mandate taking of child witnesses' testimony via closed circuit television in either provision. J.E. v. Commonwealth, 521 S.W.3d 210, 2017<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 99</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court of Appeals of Kentucky interprets the phrase “not unduly burdensome to the rights of the defendant” from Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 26A.140 to be analogous to the requirement of a finding of a compelling need found in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.350" target="_self">421.350,</a></cite> as both provisions would require such finding under judicial precedent in order to comply with the Confrontation Clause. J.E. v. Commonwealth, 521 S.W.3d 210, 2017<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 99</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).

       <p>
        Compelling need language of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.350" target="_self">421.350</a></cite> requires a determination that the child witness would be unable to testify in open court. The Kentucky Statute does not provide a blanket process for taking the testimony of every child witness by TV simply because testifying may be stressful. J.E. v. Commonwealth, 521 S.W.3d 210, 2017<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 99</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).

        District court abused its discretion and violated the juvenile's right to confrontation in erecting screens to obstruct his views of the child witness during her testimony where there was no evidence of a compelling need to modify the courtroom environment.

        Subsections (3) and (4) of this section do not unduly inhibit the right of cross-examination; the accused still has the right to hear and observe the witness testify and the jury has the opportunity to view the video and evaluate the demeanor and credibility of the witness.

        Although, in prosecution for sexual abuse of a three-year-old victim, certain leading questions were asked of the victim, such questions were not designed or calculated to lead the victim to make a particular statement and often ended in inconclusive or negative responses on her part; therefore, any error was harmless, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence the interview.

        Where, in prosecution for sexual abuse, rape, and sodomy, the videotape testimony of the ten-year-old complaining witness was introduced under subsection (2) of this section, and the videotape testimony was heard without a determination of witness competency and without the taking of an oath, the testimony was inadmissible, and it was of no consequence that the child witness was declared competent to testify and took an oath after the videotape was played.

       <p>
        In a prosecution of the defendant for the murder of his wife and the rape of his stepdaughter, the statute was violated and a new trial was required with regard to the rape charge since (1) the defendant was excluded from the courtroom while the victim testified and was required to view the testimony by video monitor, whereas the statute provides that the defendant will remain in the courtroom and the child witness will testify from another room, (2) the defendant was not in continuous audio contact with his defense counsel, and (3) no hearing was held nor finding made with respect to whether there was a compelling need to employ the procedure in the case.

However, that error was harmless under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Ky.

       The important public policy and interest in protecting the welfare and psychological and physical well-being of children is no less compelling when the child is a witness to a crime rather than a victim, and this important public policy is sufficient to justify the absence of face-to-face confrontation with the defendant where the court determines that use of closed circuit television or video taped testimony, is necessary in a particular case; therefore, the extending of the special procedures of this section to witnesses who are 12 years of age or younger did not violate the defendant’s state or federal constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.<cite class=OAG>OAG 96-14</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section and Kentucky Acts 1996 chapter 178 (Senate Bill 169), which amended this section by extending the procedures for use of video taped and closed circuit television testimony to not only offenses involving sexual contact but also to proceedings where the child is alleged to be abused, neglected or otherwise endangered are directly related to furthering the important public policy of protecting the well-being and welfare of children; thus, use of the special procedures provided by the statute in these narrowly defined types of cases for a narrowly defined group of witnesses, is not unconstitutionally broad and does not violate the defendant’s rights to confrontation under the state and federal constitutions.<cite class=OAG>OAG 96-14</cite>.

        In a death penalty case, because defendant was being tried for the murder of the second victim, and not the first victim, the first victim's wife was not a victim of the crime for which defendant was being tried and her victim impact testimony should not have been considered by the jury as it affected defendant's constitutional rights; however, the error was harmless because the jury heard how defendant had been incarcerated in Oklahoma awaiting sentencing for two other murders when he escaped; the proof included the proper victim-impact testimony from the second victim's daughter; and the jury heard testimony that defendant had claimed that killing people was like killing dogs and that it was easy after the first one.

       (4/14/2020). 2020 Ky.

If such an amendment is not ratified, this Act shall be void.” On June 13, 2019, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the language of the proposed amendment was not properly submitted to the voters at that election and, therefore, its ratification was void under Section 256 of the Kentucky Constitution. Consequently, the repeal and reenactment of this statute in

Acts ch. 101, sec. 8, provides that the repeal and reenactment of this statute in Section 4 of that Act “shall take effect only upon the ratification, in the general election of November 3, 2020, of a Constitutional amendment providing for the protection of crime victims’ rights.

        Where defendant agreed to plea agreement whereby he pled guilty to one count of assault in the second degree and in return Commonwealth agreed to recommend the minimum sentence of five (5) years and take no stand on probation, victim’s response at the sentencing to inquiry of court as to the possible structure of a restitution agreement, whereby victim was merely informing the court that the payment rate was acceptable in the event probation was ultimately granted, was not a waiver of her right to take a stand on shock probation. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 839 S.W.2d 17, 1992<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 171</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).

       <p>
        Court rejected defendant’s argument that his opportunity to controvert the contents of a presentence investigation (PSI) report pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc532s532.050" target="_blank">532.050</a></cite> applied to a victim impact statement pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.520" target="_self">421.520</a></cite> so as to afford him the opportunity to also controvert the contents of a victim impact statement because, unlike KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc532s532.050" target="_blank">532.050</a></cite>, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.520" target="_self">421.520</a></cite> did not specifically afford a defendant an opportunity to controvert the contents of a victim impact statement. Although KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc421s421.520" target="_self">421.520</a></cite>(1) permits a victim impact statement to be included in a PSI report or submitted by itself if a defendant waives the PSI report, nothing in either statute suggests that the rules governing challenges to PSI reports also apply to victim impact statements; absent such a provision or case law supporting such an application, the trial court did not err by declining to afford defendant such an opportunity. Phillips v. Commonwealth, 297 S.W.3d 593, 2009<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 179</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2009).

        Where defendant and Commonwealth agreed to a plea agreement whereby defendant pled guilty to one count of assault in the second degree and Commonwealth agreed to recommend the minimum sentence of five (5) years and take no stand on probation but victim was not a party to the agreement, the victim had the right to convey the impact of the crime to the court and take a stand on sentencing.

If such an amendment is not ratified, this Act shall be void.” On June 13, 2019, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the language of the proposed amendment was not properly submitted to the voters at that election and, therefore, its ratification was void under Section 256 of the Kentucky Constitution.

     Summoning prisoner in this state to testify in another state.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A judge of the state court of record in another state, which by its laws has made provision for commanding persons confined in penal institutions within that state to attend and testify in this state, may certify that there is a criminal proceeding or investigation by a grand jury or a criminal action pending in the court, that a person who is confined in a penal institution in this state may be a material witness in the proceeding, investigation or action, and that his presence will be required during a specified time. Upon presentation of the certificate to any judge having jurisdiction over the person confined, and upon notice to the Attorney General, the judge in this state shall fix a time and place for a hearing and shall make an order directed to the person having custody of the prisoner requiring that the prisoner be produced before him at the hearing.

     <p>
      If at the hearing the judge determines that the witness may be material and necessary, that his attending and testifying are not adverse to the interests of this state or to the health or legal rights of the witness, that the laws of the state in which he is requested to testify will give him protection from arrest and the service of civil and criminal process because of any act committed prior to his arrival in the state under the order, and that as a practical matter the possibility is negligible that the witness may be subject to arrest or to the service of civil or criminal process in any state through which he will be required to pass, the judge shall issue an order, with a copy of the certificate attached, directing the witness to attend and testify, directing the person having custody of the witness to produce him, in the court where the criminal action is pending, or where the grand jury investigation is pending, at a time and place specified in the order, and prescribing such conditions as the judge shall determine.

The order shall not become effective until the judge of the state requesting the witness enters an order directing compliance with the conditions prescribed.

        Defendant's claim of an error in the denial of his motion to suppress was rejected; detectives asked defendant the same or similar questions several times, but the evidence did not support defendant's argument that repeated questioning was designed to elicit a desired answer, and instead, it was designed to clarify his changing version of events, plus there was no indication that the detectives exerted any undue pressure from which defendant would have wanted to escape, and thus their actions did not violate the statute.

        Trial court erred in failing to suppress defendant's confession to officers, as the use of false statements and a phony DNA lab report as the sole basis for hours of unrecorded interrogation offended defendant's right to due process, and the weight of false evidence against defendant and the pressures exerted by interrogating officers overwhelmed defendant's conscience.

Hill's Adm'x v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 240<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 172</cite>, 41 S.W.2d 935, 1931<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 360</cite> (Ky. 1931). See Mutual Ben. Life Ins. Co. v.

        Under common-law rule, to create presumption of death it was necessary to prove that absentee had not been heard from, whereas under statute it is necessary to prove only departure from state and nonreturn for requisite period; presumption of death so arising could be overcome by evidence from opponent that absentee had been heard from during that period. Wiggins v. New York Life Ins. Co., 2 F. Supp. 365, 1932 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1635 (D.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 1932</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under common-law rule it is not necessary to show that person who disappeared left the state, but only that he left his residence, and has not been heard of for seven (7) years by those who, if he were living, would naturally hear from him. Hill's Adm'x v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 240<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 172</cite>, 41 S.W.2d 935, 1931<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 360</cite> (Ky. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        At common law, where absence of seven (7) years results in presumption of death, one who relies upon such absence must show evidence of diligence in attempt to locate absentee in order to establish inference of death. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Smith's Adm'x, 289<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 531</cite>, 159 S.W.2d 406, 1942<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 596</cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not constitute the entire law on the presumption of death arising from seven (7) years’ absence, since the common-law rule on the subject was not repealed. Under the common-law rule, one who relies on the unexplained absence of another for the stipulated period must not only prove that fact, but must also produce evidence of a diligent effort to find the missing person in order to justify the inference that death is the probable reason why he has not been heard from. Bechtold v. Klefken, 300<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 797</cite>, 190 S.W.2d 479, 1945<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 654</cite> (Ky. 1945).

       <p>
        This section does not abrogate the common-law rule that after lapse of seven (7) years without intelligence of life ceases and burden of proof devolves on other party to show that such person is alive. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Edelen's Ex'x, 308<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 455</cite>, 214 S.W.2d 769, 1948<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 956</cite> (Ky. 1948).

       <p>
        Evidence that missing person had left his brother’s home some 22 years ago, and had not been heard from by brother, who would naturally hear from him if he was alive, was sufficient to establish common-law presumption of death. Daugherty v. Rouse, 309<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 794</cite>, 219 S.W.2d 42, 1949<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 820</cite> (Ky. 1949).

        Kentucky will follow the common-law rule, in cases where this section does not apply, that one who relies on the unexplained absence of another for seven (7) years must not only prove that fact, but must also produce evidence of a diligent effort to find the missing person, or show that he had not been heard from by those persons who naturally would hear from him if he was alive.

        Evidence raised presumption of death, where resident, not living harmoniously with wife, left state and was seen only once thereafter in another state by infant daughter more than seven (7) years before, and he was not thereafter heard from, notwithstanding discovery of oil on his farm was widely advertised, and information was sought from relatives and various police headquarters.

        In action on life policy, evidence showed that death occurred at beginning of seven-year period, where that period had elapsed and it was shown that insured disappeared after going to gambling place at river’s edge, where fight occurred, splash was heard, and widespread search failed to locate insured, and he had not been heard from by relatives.

        When full seven-year period had elapsed, under both common law and this section there was raised rebuttable presumption of death, burden of proof shifted, and if rebuttal evidence was circumstantial there was thus presented question of fact for jury.

        Presumption of death of absentee prior to expiration of seven (7) years after he had last been heard from did not arise, where absentee was 58-year-old man in good physical condition, who never wrote to relatives, and who was wanderer in habits, especially as his older brothers were still alive, notwithstanding he knew he had inherited money from relatives but did not seek to obtain it. Glasscock v. Weare, 192<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 654</cite>, 234 S.W. 216, 1921<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 125</cite> (Ky. 1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proof of death within statutory period of seven (7) years need not be direct evidence, but may be shown by evidence of age, physical condition and other facts inducing more reasonable belief that he has died than that he had survived. Glasscock v. Weare, 192<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 654</cite>, 234 S.W. 216, 1921<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 125</cite> (Ky. 1921).

        While presumption of death must be indulged at end of seven (7) successive years of absence, and cannot sooner be indulged, proof of death at particular time within that period may be shown by evidence.

        Letters received from absentee shortly after leaving state indicating intention to kill himself were some evidence of that intention, and were admissible in determining time of death, since they created reasonable probability of death at certain time.

        Burden of proving that death occurred at beginning of seven-year period rested upon plaintiff, and arbitrary presumption of death arising from seven (7) years’ absence did not aid her in establishing that fact. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Meade, 281<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 36</cite>, 134 S.W.2d 960, 1939<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 6</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        Exposure to specific peril is of much probative value in determining time of death. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Meade, 281<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 36</cite>, 134 S.W.2d 960, 1939<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 6</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        It is presumed that the absent person’s death occurred at the expiration of the seven-year period. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Meade, 281<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 36</cite>, 134 S.W.2d 960, 1939<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 6</cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The presumption is against person claiming that death occurred at beginning of period, since continuance of life is presumed, but death may be established by circumstantial evidence, and collection of facts and probative significance to be accorded special circumstances may justify an inference of death on or about a certain date. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Meade, 281<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 36</cite>, 134 S.W.2d 960, 1939<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 6</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        Where petition in action on insurance policy alleged that insured died at expiration of seven-year period, but also alleged that insured had disappeared and had not been heard from for seven (7) years, it was not necessary that plaintiff prove that death occurred at time alleged, where policy was still in force at expiration of seven-year period, and failure to prove that death occurred at time alleged did not constitute a material variance. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Meade, 281<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 36</cite>, 134 S.W.2d 960, 1939<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 6</cite> (Ky. 1939).

        In an action on life policies, evidence that assured left state more than seven (7) years ago, then suddenly disappeared after having written letters to his wife and daughter; that he left toilet articles and personal belongings at his last known place of residence; that he was an alcoholic; that an unprecedented flood occurred at the place of his last known whereabouts shortly after he was last heard from; and that a diligent search disclosed no trace of him, was sufficient to raise the presumption of death provided for in this section, and it was a question for the jury to decide the date of assured’s death, whether at the beginning of the seven-year period, at the end of the period, or at some time in between.

        Notwithstanding absentee, who had resided in this state, departed and allegedly acquired residence in another state where he was seen, presumption of death arises after absence of seven (7) years without being heard from and can be overcome only by proof to contrary.

     <p>
      When any papers in any suit pending or decided in any court have been lost, destroyed, defaced, or obliterated, and there is in existence an attested copy thereof, such copy may be filed in the office where such papers belong in lieu of the originals, and shall be prima facie evidence of the contents of the originals, and may be used as such originals could have been in all after proceedings in the suits to which the original papers belonged. The party whose rights or interests are affected by the filing of such copies shall be notified thereof, and may, upon notice to the adverse party or his attorney, move to strike such copies from the files, and the court shall, if justice requires, strike them from the files of the court.

      If the record of any unexecuted judgment or final order of a court of record of this state is lost, mutilated, defaced, or destroyed, any person interested therein may, upon ten (10) days’ written notice to the adverse party, move the court in which the judgment was rendered or final order was made to reenter the same of record. Upon satisfactory proof that a judgment or final order has theretofore been entered of record and that it has been mutilated, defaced, or destroyed, and the purport thereof, the court shall reenter it of record. The reentered judgment or final order shall have the same effect as the original and official copies thereof shall be admissible as evidence for all purposes for which copies of the original would be competent. No judgment for costs shall be rendered against the defendant in the motion unless he controverts the plaintiff’s right and fails in his defense.

If the person fails to execute a new bond when so required the court shall enter an order vacating his office or station.

        This section applied only to cases where records were lost or destroyed that affected entire public, not to loss of single paper that could be supplied by notice to adverse party and proof taken. Harlan's Heirs v. Arthur, 3 S.W. 151, 8<cite class=ky_rptr_code>Ky. L. Rptr. 697</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1887).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where, after remand of cause to court below, pleadings and other papers were removed from clerk’s office and lost, court properly permitted filing of copy of transcript of record on file in Court of Appeals to replace lost papers. Oppenheimer v. Riley, 69<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 118</cite>, 1869<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 115</cite> (Ky. 1869) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where officer’s return upon an execution never reached clerk’s office, it was not a court record and could not be supplied by commissioner under statutory provisions. Harlan's Heirs v. Arthur, 3 S.W. 151, 8<cite class=ky_rptr_code>Ky. L. Rptr. 697</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1887).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in undertaking to supply records upon which judgment in suit depended after their destruction by fire in courthouse, commissioner was appointed, took proof and filed report but did not supply lost records, Court of Appeals could not say whether pleadings supported judgment, because there were no pleadings, but merely commissioner’s general statement of what pleadings contained. Puckett v. Morris, 181<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 374</cite>, 206 S.W. 157, 1918<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 630</cite> (Ky. 1918).

         3. — Substitutions.
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where no affidavit that no attested copy of lost papers existed known to party seeking substitution of papers was filed, and testimony of party’s attorney was not taken, and clerk of court merely stated his opinion that copies of petition and judgment were correct, court lacked authority to substitute papers accompanying commissioner’s report for originals. Haney v. McClure, 88<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 146</cite>, 10 S.W. 427, 10<cite class=ky_rptr_code>Ky. L. Rptr. 711</cite>, 1889<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 11</cite> (Ky. 1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence taken by commissioner as regards substitution of papers for lost records in case is not to be used in lieu of lost records; testimony is merely evidence upon which court acts in making substitution for lost records; court order is essential to effect substitution. Mayo v. Emery, 103<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 637</cite>, 45 S.W. 1048, 20<cite class=ky_rptr_code>Ky. L. Rptr. 638</cite>, 1898<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 111</cite> (Ky. 1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that judgment had been rendered and that case was not on docket did not prevent court from making order appointing commissioner to take testimony as regards substitution of papers for lost ones. Mayo v. Emery, 103<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 637</cite>, 45 S.W. 1048, 20<cite class=ky_rptr_code>Ky. L. Rptr. 638</cite>, 1898<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 111</cite> (Ky. 1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section contemplates substitution by order of court of formal copy for pleading which has been lost or destroyed. Puckett v. Morris, 181<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 374</cite>, 206 S.W. 157, 1918<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 630</cite> (Ky. 1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        When petition in suit is lost or destroyed and a new one is substituted for it, substituted petition becomes only petition in case and court will give judgment as if it were the original pleading. Puckett v. Morris, 181<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 374</cite>, 206 S.W. 157, 1918<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 630</cite> (Ky. 1918).

        Deposition taken by commissioner in proceeding to supply lost record could not be read in evidence as substituted record. Morrison v. Price, 130<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 139</cite>, 112 S.W. 1090, 1908<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 235</cite> (Ky. 1908).

        It was not error for court trying case to permit plaintiff to substitute copy of petition for one which had been lost, without reference to commissioner, there being no objection that substituted petition differed from original.

        Testimony of county judge, county attorney and others that county judge had made and filed order admitting accused to bail in certain sum and that order had been lost was admissible, law respecting method of supplying lost records not being prohibitory of oral evidence. Bullock v. Commonwealth, 96<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 537</cite>, 29 S.W. 341, 16<cite class=ky_rptr_code>Ky. L. Rptr. 621</cite>, 1895<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 114</cite> (Ky. 1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony of witness and police judge as to the contents of a record of judgment that had been lost should have been received, since contents of record which has been lost and not supplied may be shown by parol evidence. Morrison v. Price, 130<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 139</cite>, 112 S.W. 1090, 1908<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 235</cite> (Ky. 1908).

       <p>
        There is both a statutory and common-law mode of restoring lost or destroyed records: (1) a commissioner may be appointed by the court whose records have been lost or destroyed, who shall take proof and report; (2) court, upon satisfactory proof, may substitute a paper for the one lost or destroyed. Commonwealth v. Keger, 62<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 240</cite>, 1864<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 41</cite> (Ky. 1864) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court has inherent power to supply, on proof, its own lost or defaced records, and, since mode of appointment of commissioner to take and report evidence pursuant to law is not prescribed, petition giving all facts is not unlawful or inappropriate mode of proceeding. Deshong v. Cain, 62<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 309</cite>, 1864<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 72</cite> (Ky. 1864) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court whose records were destroyed by fire could appoint commissioner, who was authorized to hold hearings on public notice and take evidence in writing as to record destroyed, which should be legal evidence and returned to court. Green v. Stevens, 63<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 420</cite>, 1 Ky. Op. 36 (Ky. 1866) (decided under prior law).

        When lost pleading in case was promptly and correctly supplied under eye of court trying case, it was unnecessary to continue trial to future day. Gregory v. Meister, 141<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 54</cite>, 132 S.W. 399, 1910<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 427</cite> (Ky. 1910).

       <p>
        This section pertaining to lost records is cumulative; judge, whether common law or chancellor, may supply lost records of his court either by motion or petition. Bush v. Lisle, 86<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 504</cite>, 6 S.W. 330, 9<cite class=ky_rptr_code>Ky. L. Rptr. 667</cite>, 1888<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 1</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        When record has been supplied by order of court, judgment of court is conclusive that all preliminary steps were properly taken. Morrison v. Price, 130<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 139</cite>, 112 S.W. 1090, 1908<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 235</cite> (Ky. 1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two modes of supplying lost records: first by court substituting an attested copy for the lost or destroyed record pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.200" target="_self">422.200</a></cite>; and, second, by a commissioner appointed by the court who shall take proof and supply the lost record from the proof so taken pursuant to this section. Puckett v. Morris, 181<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 374</cite>, 206 S.W. 157, 1918<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 630</cite> (Ky. 1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        That lost records of case were not supplied as prescribed in this section was not objectionable, where, after case was prepared for trial, record was lost, and court appointed commissioner to supply copy, but parties without objection submitted pleadings and parts of record and retook depositions. Moore v. Shepherd, 189<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 593</cite>, 225 S.W. 484, 1920<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 479</cite> (Ky. 1920).

       <p>
        Judgment in proceeding to supply lost record is final order, and proof taken before commissioner would be material only on appeal from that order. Turner v. Hamlin, 152<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 469</cite>, 153 S.W. 778, 1913<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 695</cite> (Ky. 1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal, Court of Appeals will presume that commissioner proceeded properly to supply lost record, where original judgment contained copy of supplied record and of court order supplying it, as against contention that it was not shown that commissioner took proof or that no attested copy of lost paper existed. Turner v. Hamlin, 152<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 469</cite>, 153 S.W. 778, 1913<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 695</cite> (Ky. 1913).

        Copy of petition in action was properly permitted to be substituted for original which had been destroyed by fire in clerk’s office, where court before which case was called for trial was satisfied by proper evidence of substantial correspondence between substituted petition and original; accidental destruction of petition should not abate action after process served.

     <p>
      When any written instrument, authorized by law to be recorded, has been so recorded, and the book containing it has been lost, destroyed, mutilated or defaced, and there is not in existence a copy of such writing known to the person claiming under it, such person may institute a suit in equity, in the county where such instrument was recorded, against the grantors or obligors in the writing, or his heirs or personal representatives, setting forth the fact of the existence of such writing, and the destruction of the record. Upon hearing, the court may render judgment that the defendants make and execute another writing in lieu of the original, of the same tenor and effect. Upon the failure of the defendants to execute a new writing within a reasonable time, the court shall cause the same to be executed by a commissioner, which shall vest in plaintiff all the rights vested in him by the original writing. If the recorded instrument be a conveyance for land, the plaintiff may make defendants any or all who have had title to the land for fifteen (15) years preceding the institution of the suit. No judgment for costs shall be rendered against the defendants unless they make defense and fail therein, except that, if they fail to convey or execute a new writing when adjudged to do so by the court, they shall, if adults, pay the cost of making the writing by a commissioner.

        States have substantial flexibility in deciding what procedures are needed in the context of postconviction relief, and a state may properly limit the available procedures, which will be found to violate due process only if they are fundamentally inadequate to vindicate the substantive rights provided. The procedures established in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite> are sufficient to vindicate any substantive right to DNA testing that might also be created by the statute, as the procedures are similar to those provided for DNA evidence by federal law and the law of other States, and they are not inconsistent with the traditions and conscience of our people or with any recognized principle of fundamental fairness; as such, due process requires no additional rights beyond what is already provided in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite> and the various postconviction procedures found in Kentucky law.

        There is no substantive due process right to DNA testing, nor is there a procedural due process right to anything beyond what KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite> currently provides.

        Because defendant could not establish that even if defendant had both anal swab slides available for DNA testing under defendant’s preferred method, that defendant would have been able to establish a reasonable probability of exculpatory evidence, the trial court was not required to hold a hearing and properly dismissed defendant’s KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite> petition.

        Evidence must not have been previously tested for DNA or, if it was tested, the movant must show that the type of testing now being requested is qualitatively different and may resolve an issue not previously resolved by the previous testing and analysis. KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285ol12c" target="_self">422.285(2)(c)</a></cite> and (3)(c). By this language, the legislature made clear its intent not to have successive, redundant DNA testing requests and placed a high burden on a movant to establish that an entirely new issue is involved. Otherwise, DNA testing, sometimes many years after trial, is limited to the one bite of the apple rule. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 462, 2010<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 313</cite> (Ky. 2010).

        Where there is enough other incriminating evidence and an explanation for the DNA result, science alone cannot prove a prisoner innocent. The availability of technologies not available at trial cannot mean that every criminal conviction, or even every criminal conviction involving biological evidence, is suddenly in doubt. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 462, 2010<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 313</cite> (Ky. 2010).

        Testing under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite> requires that the evidence is still in existence and is in a condition that allows DNA testing and analysis to be conducted; if the evidence does not exist, then it obviously cannot be tested, and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite> only gives the right to a test, not to reversal of a conviction simply where testing is impossible. Thus, as a precondition to ordering testing under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite>, the trial court must also find that the evidence requested to be tested exists in a condition that will allow proper DNA testing; if it is not, then obviously the inquiry is at an end. Moore v. Commonwealth, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 91</cite> (Ky. June 16, 2011), modified, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky.

        Evidence to be tested for DNA must exist even though a trial court may have found reasonable probability that the evidence as described by the movant would exonerate him, lead to a more favorable verdict, or definitely be exculpatory.

        Circuit court erred in concluding that it was precluded from ordering DNA testing to be performed by an outside laboratory and in concluding that any testing ordered had to be performed by the Kentucky State Police forensic laboratory because
    KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.287" target="_self">422.287</a></cite> applied only to pre-conviction, pretrial testing, and its requirements did not control post-conviction proceedings under

        Circuit court erred in concluding that it was precluded from ordering DNA testing to be performed by an outside laboratory and in concluding that any testing ordered had to be performed by the Kentucky State Police forensic laboratory because KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285ol17" target="_self">422.285(7)</a></cite> authorized the circuit court to make “any other orders that the court deems appropriate.” That was a fairly broad power and clearly anticipated that the initial test done by the police laboratory might not be the end of any testing. Moore v. Commonwealth, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 91</cite> (Ky. June 16, 2011), modified, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky.

        Trial court’s finding under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite> in support of an order for testing, that there is a reasonable probability that an appellant may have been exonerated if the results of DNA testing were favorable, is not by itself conclusive of anything. The trial court’s finding is only relevant and significant to support requiring testing. By itself, without favorable results from a DNA test, that finding is meaningless as it relates to guilt or innocence. Section<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite> is only a mechanism for obtaining post-conviction DNA testing, which in turn might be used to show innocence or be exculpatory to a lesser degree. The statute is not itself a mechanism for speculating about innocence. Moore v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 191</cite> (Ky. 2011), modified, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 190</cite> (Ky. Nov. 23, 2011).

        On a motion for DNA testing under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite>, a circuit court need not necessarily make separate findings for each piece of evidence to be tested. Moore v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 191</cite> (Ky. 2011), modified, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 190</cite> (Ky. Nov. 23, 2011).

        Whether and when to order the collection of a sample of a KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285" target="_self">422.285</a></cite> petitioner’s DNA falls within the sound discretion of the trial court. So, too, does allowing the testing of a self-collected sample submitted by a petitioner’s counsel. While this latter practice may not be the best one, since it presents a greater possibility for mischief, a trial court is sufficiently cognizant of the risks of such self-collection to take steps to minimize them. Moore v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 191</cite> (Ky. 2011), modified, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 190</cite> (Ky. Nov. 23, 2011).

        While KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc17s17.176" target="_blank">17.176</a></cite> anticipates that DNA testing will ordinarily be done by the Kentucky State Police Forensic Laboratory or its designee, and may even evince a preference that testing be done there, it does not impose a limit on who may test, nor does it require that testing be performed by the Kentucky State Police Forensic Laboratory or a lab of its choice in all cases. Instead, whether to order independent or outside testing falls within the sound discretion of the circuit court. The only limit on the court’s power to order outside testing is that it may do so only if it deems such testing appropriate. KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285ol17" target="_self">422.285(7)</a></cite>. Moore v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 470, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky.

        Although the circuit court erred in its determination that it did not have jurisdiction to decide appellant's motion for DNA testing under this section, the error was harmless. Comparing DNA evidence from the scene with the now identified victim's DNA was highly unlikely to benefit appellant or change the outcome of his conviction and sentence. Peak v. Commonwealth, 482 S.W.3d 409, 2015<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 97</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).

        Since appellant was convicted in the Jefferson Circuit Court, that court was the proper venue for appellant to seek DNA testing, and this section granted that court jurisdiction to review and either grant or deny appellant's petition.

       <p>
        Defendant was convicted of the 1990 murders of a couple and assault of their infant son, who was shot during the crimes, and he received capital sentences; he moved for DNA testing, claiming that such testing would prove that another person committed the crimes. The trial court did not err in denying his petition because the age of any DNA found could not be established sufficiently to determine when it was deposited and DNA testing at best could result in mere speculation; as the owner of the vehicle and jacket that defendant wanted to have tested, defendant’s DNA would obviously be found, and if DNA belonging to a member of the victims’
    family was also found, without being able to precisely pinpoint when the DNA was deposited, it would prove nothing. Even if another’s DNA could be found in the car or on defendant’s jacket after 16 years, that fact did not give rise to a reasonable probability of exonerating defendant, nor was there a reasonable probability that it would change the verdict or be exculpatory in any way. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 2011<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 98</cite> (Ky. Mar. 24, 2011).
       </p>

        Although the trial court’s written order omitted the phrase, “reasonable probability,” with respect to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285ol13a" target="_self">422.285(3)(a)</a></cite>, the trial court appropriately applied that standard in denying DNA testing. Even if the hairs that defendant sought to test were not his, it would not have proven that he was never inside the car where they were found. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 381 S.W.3d 180, 2012<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 64</cite> (Ky. 2012).

         5. Burden of Proof.
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        First level of proof the movant must make in support of the DNA testing request, under either KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285ol12" target="_self">422.285(2)</a></cite> or (3) is that the evidence sought would either exonerate the defendant, lead to a more favorable verdict or sentence, or otherwise be exculpatory. To do this, the movant must describe the role the evidence would have had if available in the original prosecution. It is obvious that at this point the movant will not know with certainty what the DNA evidence will show. Thus, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285ol12" target="_self">422.285(2)</a></cite>(a) and (3)(a)(1) require the court to undertake the reasonable probability analysis under the assumption that the evidence will be favorable to the movant. This assumption does not mean that the movant gets a free pass simply because he can allege that the evidence will be helpful. He must still state what he expects the evidence to be and how that evidence would, within a reasonable probability, result in exoneration or a more favorable verdict or sentence or be exculpatory. In the exercise of sound discretion, the trial court must then make the call whether such reasonable probability exists, looking to whether such evidence would probably result in a different verdict or sentence. However, the analysis does not stop there. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 462, 2010<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 313</cite> (Ky. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285ol12" target="_self">422.285(2)</a></cite> and (3) also require that the DNA evidence still be in existence and in such a condition that testing can be conducted. KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.285ol12" target="_self">422.285(2)</a></cite>(b) and (3)(b). This requires the movant, at a bare minimum, to specifically identify what is to be tested, and where on the item the DNA is expected to be found, as it is patently unreasonable to expect every area of an item to be tested. Since the evidence is not in the movant’s custody, this may require the Commonwealth to establish the existence and condition of the evidence left in its or the court’s control. If the Commonwealth objects that the evidence is not testable, since the state is the custodian of the evidence, the Commonwealth must go forward with expert testimony as to the viability of testing, which the movant may rebut. Even though a trial court may have found reasonable probability that the evidence as described by the movant would exonerate him, lead to a more favorable verdict, or definitely be exculpatory, the trial court must also find that the evidence requested to be tested exists in a condition that will allow proper DNA testing. If it is not, then obviously the inquiry is at an end. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 357 S.W.3d 462, 2010<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 313</cite> (Ky. 2010).

        The trial court did not abuse its discretion where it declined to admit into evidence, a voluminous hospital record, in the absence of any witness to comment upon it or explain it to the jury as if the record had been admitted in mass and without the prior treating physician or any physician available to explain, counsel would have been free to draw whatever conclusions they wished without fear of evidentiary contradiction and, in the heat of trial, there was a probability that distortion, confusion or misunderstanding would have resulted.

        A trial court is not required to accept into evidence a large volume of hospital records without there having been any witness comment upon or explanation of the records to the jury. Young v.

        Trial court abused its discretion by excluding an injured bus passenger’s medical records as hearsay because the documents were prepared by an individual with personal knowledge of the subject matter and in the course of the regularly conducted business activity of a hospital. Zewoldi v. Transit Auth., 553 S.W.3d 841, 2018<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. App. LEXIS 144</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in limiting the cross-examination of a doctor using an unexplained audit trail because a patient was able to ask questions regarding what portions of her medical records the doctor viewed without using the audit trail; even had the record been deemed self-authenticated, absent an explanation, the audit trail could have been confusing to the jury.

    When a subpoena duces tecum is served upon any employee of any hospital, requiring the production of any such medical charts or records at any action or proceeding, it is sufficient if the employee of the hospital charged with the responsibility of being custodian of the original thereof promptly notifies, in writing, the attorney for the party causing service of the subpoena, of the hospital’s election to proceed under the provisions of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.300" target="_self">422.300</a></cite> to<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.330" target="_self">422.330</a></cite> and of the estimated actual and reasonable expenses of reproducing such charts or records. Upon such notification, the attorney causing the service of the subpoena shall notify all other attorneys of record or other parties if they are not represented by attorneys of the hospital’s election. Following such election, the employee of the hospital charged with the responsibility of being custodian of the original charts or records specified in the subpoena shall hold the originals available at the hospital, and upon payment to the hospital of the estimated reproduction expenses by the party causing service of the subpoena, or by any other party, shall promptly deliver, by certified mail or by personal delivery, legible and durable copies, certified by said hospital employee, of all medical charts or records specified in such subpoena to the person specified in the subpoena.

The original records were made in the regular course of business, and it was the regular course of (name of hospital) to make such records at or near the time of the matter recorded. This certification is given pursuant to KRS
    . . . . .
    by the custodian of the records in lieu of his or her personal appearance.” Such copies shall be separately enclosed and sealed in an inner envelope or wrapper bearing the legend “Copies of Medical Records,” and the title and number of the action or proceeding, the date of the subpoena, the name of the hospital, the full name of the patient, the patient’s medical record number and the name and business telephone number of the employee making the certification, and the sealed envelope or wrapper, together with the certification, shall then be enclosed and sealed in an outer envelope or wrapper, and delivered to the requesting party.

If personal attendance of a witness is required for the reason provided in this section, the hospital may nevertheless elect to substitute true, legible and durable copies of the charts or records specified in the subpoena duces tecum by the giving of a written notice of such election, in which case payment to the hospital of the actual and reasonable expenses of duplication of such charts or records by any party to the proceeding in which the subpoena was issued, or such party’s attorney of record, shall be a condition precedent to the personal attendance of any person pursuant to the subpoena, unless otherwise ordered by the court or other body before which said action or proceeding is pending.

       A patient is entitled to require a medical provider to produce one free copy of their medical records without charge. While an insurance company, acting as a reparations obligor, cannot require a patient to assign their free copy to the insurance company, a patient may make this assignment to a party of their choosing.<cite class=OAG>OAG 09-009</cite>.

       Where response from the Transportation Cabinet, Division of Driver Licensing to a request to inspect various records relating to a client’s licensing process initially required payment to a rehabilitation center for $40.00 for an “in-car driver evaluation” performed at the center, later modified to a cost of $1.00 per page for the report, the Cabinet violated the reasonable fee provision of the Open Records Act, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.874ol13" target="_blank">61.874(3)</a></cite>. The courts and the Office of the Attorney General have determined that a charge of ten cents per page is reasonable for a standard 8-1/2 inches x 11 inches paper copy. It should also be noted that under subsection (1) of this section, if the Cabinet had not retained a copy or if the requesting party had not proceeded under the Open Records Act, subsection (1) of this section may have required a release of the records without charge. 96-ORD-267.

      When the copies of records are delivered to a party or his attorney of record for use in a deposition, they shall, after termination of the deposition, be delivered personally or by certified mail to the clerk of the court or other body before which the action or proceeding is pending, and it shall be the responsibility of such party or attorney to transmit the receipt obtained to the employee of the hospital charged with responsibility of being custodian of the original records. When the records are received by the clerk of a court or other body from the hospital or from a party or his attorney of record they shall be retained in the clerk’s custody at all times except when actually used in the action or proceeding. Upon issuance of a final order terminating a case, the copies of the records will be promptly filed by the clerk of the court with all other documents pertaining to the case until such a time as the normal retention period for court records expires. The copies of records shall then be permanently disposed of by the clerk in a manner that protects the confidentiality of the medical information contained therein. Should the case be appealed, the copies of records shall be forwarded to the Court of Appeals with other documents pertaining to the case and retained and disposed of in the manner previously described.

       In
    1990 Ky. Acts, ch. 88 (HB 214) the General Assembly enacted the Kentucky Rules of Evidence which was codified as KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.110" target="_self">Chapter 422A</a></cite> as set out in the bound volume; section 93 of said act provided that such law would go into effect when the Kentucky Supreme Court entered an order adopting such law; however, the Supreme Court never entered such order and in 1992 said section 93 was repealed by § 31 of
    1992 Ky. Acts, ch. 324. In
    1992 Ky. Acts., ch. 324 (HB 241) the General Assembly amended certain sections of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.110" target="_self">Chapter 422A</a></cite>, and in § 34 of such Act directed that the Rules be codified as a separate part of the Kentucky Revised Statutes and not as a chapter thereof, and further directed the Reviser of Statutes to renumber the provisions of the KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc422s422.110" target="_self">Chapter 422A</a></cite> into “this separate entity in a manner consistent with the numbering found in the Federal Rules of Evidence.” Therefore, the Kentucky Rules of Evidence as enacted by
    1990 Ky. Acts ch. 88, as amended by
    1992 Ky. Acts ch. 324, have been renumbered by the Reviser of Statutes pursuant to § 34 of
    1992 Ky. Acts ch. 324 as the Kentucky Rules of Evidence, KRE Rule 101 to Rule
    1104. Said Rules became effective July 1, 1992 and are compiled in the August, 1992 Supplement to the Kentucky Rules Annotated 1992/1993 Edition.

        Trial court abused its discretion by overruling a father's modification motion on the ground that he could not be physically present in court for a hearing since he was unable to legally enter the United States; due to an older child's emancipation, the trial court was under an affirmative obligation to review the support and enter a new order, and the father argued that modification was in order due to a change in the currency exchange rate.

       Kentucky law does not permit commissioned officers or enlisted personnel to take acknowledgments or perform other notarial acts for spouses or other dependents of military personnel who are within the limits of Kentucky; however, commissioned officers and enlisted personnel may be appointed as notaries public by the Kentucky Secretary of State if they meet the requirements of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.010" target="_self">423.010</a></cite>.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-591</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based upon the language of subdivision (4) of this section, commissioned officers or enlisted personnel are not permitted to take acknowledgments or perform other notarial acts for spouses or other dependents of military personnel who are within the limits of Kentucky; the federal military reservation of Fort Knox must be considered within the limits of Kentucky for at least the limited purpose of applying subdivision (4).<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-136</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 228 of the Constitution requires an officer taking the oath of office to be a citizen or resident of Kentucky, and Const., § 234 requires all civil officers of Kentucky to reside in Kentucky; therefore, the provision of subdivision (6) of this section relating to the appointment of a special notary living in a foreign jurisdiction, is unconstitutional. However, under the principle of severability, as expressed in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXXXXIc446s446.090" target="_blank">446.090</a></cite>, this section, minus the offending language involving appointing nonresidents, is constitutional; thus the special notary, who lives in Kentucky, may, under this section, engage in notarial acts in a foreign jurisdiction, provided that such exercise of function does not violate the public policy of or is not in basic conflict with the law of the foreign jurisdiction; the extraterritorial recognition of this section is only based upon the principles of comity.<cite class=OAG>OAG 85-36</cite>.
      </p>

       The special notary, who lives in Kentucky, may, under this section, engage in notarial acts in a foreign jurisdiction, provided that such exercise of function does not violate the public policy of or is not in basic conflict with the law of the foreign jurisdiction; the extraterritorial recognition of this section is only based upon the principles of comity.<cite class=OAG>OAG 85-36</cite> (modified by<cite class=OAG>OAG 88-20</cite> to the extent of conflict).
      </p>
      <p>
       All notary publics, residents of Kentucky, including those appointed under this section, must take the oath mentioned in this section before the county judge/executive of the county in which the notary resides, and must take the oath prescribed in Const., § 228 before one of the applicable officers mentioned in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc62s62.020" target="_blank">62.020</a></cite>.<cite class=OAG>OAG 85-36</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there are no substantial reasons to prohibit nonresidents from becoming notaries in this commonwealth, barring nonresidents from the ability to practice as notaries is unconstitutional.<cite class=OAG>OAG 88-20</cite> (modifying<cite class=OAG>OAG 85-36</cite> to extent of conflict).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since residency should not be considered a requirement to practice as a notary, the provision in Const., § 228 regarding state citizenship should be deleted from the oath given to a notary; furthermore, the oath may be administered in any county.<cite class=OAG>OAG 88-20</cite>.

        Summary judgment was granted to a trustee because she could avoid a corporation’s mortgage lien on a mobile home since the trustee had priority as a bona fide purchaser pursuant to 11 USCS § 544(a)(3), since the mortgage did not meet the requirements of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.130" target="_self">423.130</a></cite> and was therefore defectively acknowledged, and because KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.150" target="_self">423.150</a></cite> did not provide any relief to the corporation.

Because the defective mortgage was treated as though it was never recorded, the assignment of the mortgage to the creditor was outside the chain of title, and the mortgage was avoided pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(a)(3). Lyon v. Franklin Mortg. Funding (In re Shannon), 343 B.R. 585, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 1087 (Bankr. E.D.<cite class=ky_code>Ky. 2006</cite>).

        Mortgage granting a company a security interest in a debtor’s property was improperly acknowledged under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.130" target="_self">423.130</a></cite> because the name of the mortgagor, the name of the county, and the date of the acknowledgment were left blank following the debtor’s signature. Because the mortgage was defectively acknowledged, any attempted conveyance was invalid as against a bona fide purchaser for value pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc382s382.270" target="_blank">382.270</a></cite>; and a bankruptcy trustee, who stood in the position of a bona fide purchaser pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(a)(3) when the debtor filed a bankruptcy petition, could therefore avoid the mortgage pursuant to § 544(a)(Schlarman v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where a mortgage was not properly acknowledged in that the notary was not present to certify that the debtors appeared before her when they signed the mortgage, the defective mortgage was not saved by the 2006 amendment to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc382s382.270" target="_blank">382.270</a></cite>. The amendment did not apply retroactively to deprive the Trustee of his status as a bona fide purchaser as of the date of filing of the bankruptcy. Spradlin v. U.S. Bank N.A., N.D.

        Even though a mortgage executed by a bankruptcy debtor was recorded, the certificate of acknowledgment was defective under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.130" target="_self">423.130</a></cite> since it did not identify the debtor as the party executing the mortgage; thus, the defective acknowledgment was insufficient to provide constructive notice of the mortgage to the bankruptcy trustee, and the mortgage was avoidable by the trustee in the capacity of a bona fide purchaser under 11 USCS § 544(a). Select Portfolio Servs. v. Burden (In re Trujillo), 378 B.R. 526, 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 3786 (B.A.P. 6th Cir. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not error for a bankruptcy court to find that an acknowledgement on a creditor’s mortgage document was defective and that the mortgage could be avoided by a trustee pursuant to 11 USCS § 544 because the acknowledgement did not comply with the requirements of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.130" target="_self">423.130</a></cite> that were in effect at the time when the notary paragraph stated only “acknowledged before me” and did not state the names of the signors or the date signed. Burden v. CIT Group/Consumer Finance Inc. (In re Wilson), 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 3800 (B.A.P. 6th Cir. Nov. 14, 2007).

       <p>
        Mortgage’s certificate of acknowledgement, which did not contain the words “acknowledged before me,” did not substantially comply with KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.130" target="_self">423.130</a></cite> and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.150" target="_self">423.150</a></cite> because it failed to establish that the president of the corporate borrower signed the instrument on behalf of the corporation by proper authority as required by KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.150" target="_self">423.150</a></cite>(3)(b).

        Where a debtor executed a mortgage on real property in favor of a creditor, but the certificate of acknowledgment did not contain the identity of the debtor as the person who acknowledged the mortgage or the date, as required by KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.130" target="_self">423.130</a></cite>, the mortgage was properly avoided pursuant to 11 USCS § 544(a) because it did not provide constructive notice to a subsequent creditor, bona fide purchaser, or bankruptcy trustee. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. v. Gardner (In re Henson), 2008 Bankr. LEXIS 1953 (B.A.P. 6th Cir. July 9, 2008).

       <p>
        Mortgage executed by debtors in favor of defendants was valid, even assuming without deciding that the acknowledgments were defective, because the mortgage was lodged by the county clerk and any defect in the acknowledgments did not have the effect of depriving creditors and the Chapter 7 trustee of constructive notice.

        Unpublished decision:
    Based upon the plain meaning of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.130" target="_self">423.130</a></cite>, as well as Sixth Circuit caselaw, a notary had to identify who signed the mortgage in the Certificate of Acknowledgment. Therefore the bankruptcy court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel correctly concluded that the mortgage did not provide constructive notice under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc382s382.270" target="_blank">382.270</a></cite> to subsequent purchasers or creditors because it was not properly acknowledged under Kentucky law and was consequently subject to avoidance by the trustee pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 544, and that it should have been preserved for the benefit of the estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 551; accordingly, the court affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court granting summary judgment to the trustee.

       (1/1/2020). Although
    2019 Ky. Acts ch. 86, sec. 32, contained a citation to “Section 27 of this Act” (codified as
    KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.430" target="_self">423.430</a></cite>) in subsection (6) of this statute, it is clear from the context that a reference to subsection (7) of this statute was intended. Similarly, a citation to “Section 27 of this Act” in subsection (7) of this statute was clearly intended to refer to Section 24 (codified as
    KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc423s423.415" target="_self">423.415</a></cite>). These manifest clerical or typographical errors were corrected in codification under the authority of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136" target="_blank">7.136</a></cite>.

   <ol class="alpha" type="a"><li class="p7" id="tXXXVIIIc424s424.120ol11a">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    It shall be published in the publication area. A newspaper shall be deemed to be published in the area if it maintains its principal office in the area for the purpose of gathering news and soliciting advertisements and other general business of newspaper publications, and has a periodicals class mailing permit issued for that office. A newspaper published outside of Kentucky shall not be eligible to carry advertisements for any county or publication area within the county, other than for the city in which its main office is located, if there is a newspaper published in the county that has a substantial general circulation throughout the county and that otherwise meets the requirements of this section; and

<span class="boldspan"></span>
    It shall be of regular issue and have a bona fide circulation in the publication area. A newspaper shall be deemed to be of regular issue if it is published at least once a week, for at least fifty (50) weeks during the calendar year as prescribed by its mailing permit, and has been so published in the area for the immediately preceding two (2) year period. A newspaper meeting all the criteria to be of regular issue, except publication in the area for the immediately preceding two (2) year period, shall be deemed to be of regular issue if it is the only paper in the publication area and has a paid circulation equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the population of the publication area. A newspaper shall be deemed to be of bona fide circulation in the publication area if it is circulated generally in the area, and maintains a definite price or consideration not less than fifty percent (50%) of its published price, and is paid for by not less than fifty percent (50%) of those to whom distribution is made; and
   </li><li class="p7" id="tXXXVIIIc424s424.120ol11c">

    It shall bear a title or name, consist of not less than four (4) pages without a cover, and be of a type to which the general public resorts for passing events of a political, religious, commercial, and social nature, and for current happenings, announcements, miscellaneous reading matter, advertisements, and other notices. The news content shall be at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the total column space in more than one-half (1/2) of its issues during any twelve (12) month period.
   </li><li class="p7" id="tXXXVIIIc424s424.120ol11d">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    If, in a publication area there is more than one (1) newspaper which meets the above requirements, the newspaper having the largest bona fide paid circulation as shown by the average number of paid copies of each issue as shown in its published statement of ownership as filed on October 1 for the publication area shall be the newspaper where advertisements required by law to be published shall be carried.

<span class="boldspan"></span>
    For the purposes of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc424" target="_self">Chapter 424</a></cite>, publishing shall be considered as the total recurring processes of producing the newspaper, embracing all of the included contents of reading matter, illustrations, and advertising enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection. A newspaper shall not be excluded from qualifying for the purposes of legal publications as provided in this chapter if its printing or reproduction processes take place outside the publication area.

         If, in the case of a publication area smaller than the county in which it is located, there is no newspaper published in the area, the publication shall be made in a newspaper published in the county that is qualified under this section to publish advertisements for the county. If the qualified newspaper publishes a zoned edition which is distributed to regular subscribers within the publication area, any advertisement required by law to be published in the publication area may be published in the zoned edition distributed in that area.

This subsection is intended to supersede any statute that provides or contemplates that newspaper publication may be dispensed with if there is no newspaper printed or published or of general circulation in the particular publication area.

       Newspapers claiming to have the largest circulation should be required to file with the fiscal court certified statements as to their circulation after which the court can make its selection from the best information available.<cite class=OAG>OAG 64-399</cite>.
      </p>

       For the purpose of legal advertisements, the “publication area” for the Kenton County airport board is Kenton County, inasmuch as the operation of the Kenton County airport, though conducted in the main in Boone County, is an official activity of the airport board, which was created by Kenton County and which is derivatively a board of Kenton County.<cite class=OAG>OAG 80-584</cite>.

       Where a county contains several cities which require publication of legal notices, but only one newspaper serves the entire county, those cities cannot satisfy the publication requirements of subsection (2) of this section by publishing the legal notices in special zoned editions of the single newspapers, which are separate newspapers distributed weekly within a specific geographic area of the county and contain local reporting and advertising, since they would not qualify on their own under subsection (2) of this section; however, the single parent newspaper would qualify because it is published in the county and has the largest bona fide circulation throughout the county.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-321</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fiscal court, in determining administratively which newspaper in the county has the greatest bona fide circulation in order to effect county legal advertising, may use any reasonable means to elicit evidence necessary to make such administrative determination; this may include a hearing, upon proper notice, and the taking of sworn testimony of witnesses and the filing of affidavits and, thus, sworn testimony may be introduced which may have the effect of challenging so-called factual data contained in affidavits of publishers previously filed.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-90</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The annual financial statement of a county cannot be carried by a newspaper other than the one having the greatest bona fide circulation since this section explicitly requires the ad to be carried by the newspaper having the greatest bona fide circulation.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-117</cite>.

       Under the express terms of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc424s424.220" target="_self">424.220</a></cite>, the officer responsible for the county financial statement must, within 60 days after the close of the fiscal year, cause the statement to be published in full in a newspaper qualified under this section to publish ads for the county (largest bona fide circulation, etc.), regardless of the financial burden imposed on the county by the cost of placing the full statement in the newspaper.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-117</cite>.

       Acts 1982, ch. 430, which amends this section and several other statutes relating to publication requirements of cities, is basically an amendment of the municipal publication requirements and does not affect the city budget process, financial matters in cities or matters relating to the administration of city finances. It gives a city a choice as to which of two devices relating to finances and expenditures must be published annually rather than requiring that they both be published and affects what a city publishes after the completion of the fiscal year, but does not affect the activities of a city during the fiscal year; it does not impair any vested rights.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-353</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to its publication provisions for municipal governments, Acts 1982, ch. 430, effective July 15, 1982, is applicable to those municipal governments for the fiscal year July 1, 1981 to June 30, 1982.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-353</cite>.

       Under subdivision (1)(d) of this section, if there is, in the publication area, more than one newspaper which meets the requirements of subdivisions (1)(a), (b), and (c) of this section, the greater bona fide circulation controls; in the event the two newspapers should, in their published statement of ownership, show an identical number relating to bona fide circulation, the fiscal court could request the two newspapers to submit affidavits relating to the precise bona fide circulation in the county, but should the affidavits contain identical figures as to the bona fide circulation, only the courts could resolve the question of which paper has the right to print county advertisements.<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-247</cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is more than one newspaper qualifying under this section to run mandated county advertising, then the newspaper with the largest bona fide circulation should get the county’s advertising; in speaking of the largest bona fide circulation, it is the circulation shown by the published statement of ownership for the publication area. However, where two county newspapers each claim that it has the largest circulation, the fiscal court in making the determination of which newspaper actually does have the highest bona fide circulation in the county may use any reasonable means to elicit evidence necessary to make such determination.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-30</cite>.

      <p>
       The circulation of a newspaper, as reflected in the “statement of ownership,” is not controlling in determining the “bona fide paid circulation” in the publication area; therefore, a fiscal court, in a county with two (2) or more newspapers that meet the requirements of this section, must solicit affidavits from otherwise qualified newspapers as to their “bona fide paid circulation” within the publication area, in order to determine which newspaper is entitled to receive statutorily required advertising of governmental notices.<cite class=OAG>OAG 95-28</cite>.

        In regard to whether or not this section regarding time and period of publication has been complied with in determining whether what was done was sufficient compliance, more liberal regard for the term substantial compliance should be had where there is a particular matter to be voted upon at regular or general election fixed by law for choosing public officers than where there will be special or called election at time not fixed by law to vote upon particular proposal, for voters are likely to attend a general election but not a special election.

        Where notice of election on proposal to issue bonds for purpose of remodeling, enlarging and equipping county hospital was not published once a week for two consecutive weeks as required by this section but there was evidence that there had been a vigorous campaign waged for and against the proposal, that there were many feature articles and publicly sponsored advertisements published in local newspapers and several editorials were written concerning the bond issue, that there were numerous radio broadcasts during the period and 20,000 cards and explanatory folders were distributed and 150 signs were posted and that numerous speaking rallies were held boosting the project, in such circumstances notice of advertisement of election was deemed a substantial compliance with the requirement of this section as the object thereof was fully accomplished. Lyon v. County of Warren, 325 S.W.2d 302, 1959<cite class=ky_app_code>Ky. LEXIS 41</cite> (Ky. 1959) (decision prior to 1960 amendment).

        Where this section regarding time and periods of publication of notice of vote on particular proposal has not been complied with in determining whether or not there has been substantial compliance, court often has considered whether voters otherwise had full and actual notice of election and of question submitted and, while official notice is mandatory and cannot be omitted, courts may consider extrinsic material or unofficial notices as supplemental to official notice.

        Statutory provisions with reference to publicizing a special election or a special proposition to be voted on at a regular election are for the purpose of informing the electorate a sufficient length of time to enable them to arrange to attend the election and make up their minds on how to vote upon the proposition; where that purpose appears to have been accomplished by a substantial compliance with statutory provisions as to times and period of publication, the election ought not and will not be voided.

       Where a city of the sixth class has already prepared an audit, it should either utilize the alternative publication method under subsection (2) of this section or the publication requirements authorized by KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc91As91A.041" target="_blank">91A.041</a></cite> (repealed) if it qualifies, or publish the audit as provided in subsections (7) and (8) of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc91As91A.040" target="_blank">91A.040</a></cite>.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-384</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a city desires to use the alternative to publication provided for in subsection (2) of this section, it is mandatory that it be done by first class mail as the statute makes no exception and the language is unambiguous; thus, to hand deliver a copy to each residence in the city would not suffice.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-551</cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       The supervision of local health departments by the department for human resources does not relieve the public officer of the local health department from his duty under this section to collect, receive, have custody, control or disbursement of funds, and the local health department is required to publish under this section as to the funds it receives and disburses unless it falls within an exception to this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 80-325</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a local health department is co-extensive with a public health taxing district with all its income and disbursements recorded in the district’s financial records, the recently enacted KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc65s65.070ol11c" target="_blank">65.070(1)(c)</a></cite> demon- strates an intention to substitute publishing information as to the availability of financial records for publishing the previously-required detailed financial statement; therefore, as to these local health departments, there is to be an exception to the publishing requirements of this section, however, where the local health department is not co-extensive with a public health taxing district with the same financial records, it will have to publish in accordance with this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 80-325</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a city-county air board is entrusted with the control and custody of public funds, the officers of the air board must comply with the provisions of this section concerning the preparation and publication of an annual financial statement.<cite class=OAG>OAG 80-577</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the 1980 legislature placed new requirements on cities with respect to accounting records and financial reports, directed each city to operate under an annual budget ordinance and repealed two preexisting statutes which had required the publishing of a summary of an annual audit, resulted in making the law such that each city must publish a summary of the audit report, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc91As91A.040" target="_blank">91A.040</a></cite>, and also fully follow the publication requirements for a financial statement set out in this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-37</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county attorneys of Kentucky are not required to publish a financial statement pursuant to this section since the auditing of the county attorney’s books pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc43s43.070" target="_blank">43.070</a></cite> and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.810" target="_blank">64.810</a></cite> is ample to disclose the specifics of his official operation.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-168</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The annual financial statement of a county cannot be carried by a newspaper other than the one having the greatest bona fide circulation since KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc424s424.120" target="_self">424.120</a></cite> explicitly requires the ad to be carried by the newspaper having the greatest bona fide circulation.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-117</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the express terms of this section, the officer responsible for the county financial statement must, within 60 days after the close of the fiscal year, cause the statement to be published in full in a newspaper qualified under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc424s424.120" target="_self">424.120</a></cite> to publish ads for the county (largest bona fide circulation, etc.), regardless of the financial burden imposed on the county by the cost of placing the full statement in the newspaper.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-117</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 1982, ch. 430, which amends several statutes relating to publication requirements of cities, including KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc91As91A.040" target="_blank">91A.040</a></cite> and this section, is basically an amendment of the municipal publication requirements and does not affect the city budget process, financial matters in cities or matters relating to the administration of city finances. It gives a city a choice as to which of two devices relating to finances and expenditures must be published annually rather than requiring that they both be published and affects what a city publishes after the completion of the fiscal year, but does not affect the activities of a city during the fiscal year; it does not impair any vested rights.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-353</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to its publication provisions for municipal governments, Acts 1982, ch. 430, effective July 15, 1982, is applicable to those municipal governments for the fiscal year July 1, 1981 to June 30, 1982.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-353</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city of the sixth class must continue to prepare an audit and publish it under the terms of subsections (7), (8) or (9) of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc91As91A.040" target="_blank">91A.040</a></cite> unless the city qualifies under the provisions of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc91As91A.040" target="_blank">91A.040</a></cite>, in which case it may in lieu of preparing an audit publish a financial statement pursuant to this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-384</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county hospital must make a paid publication of its financial statement showing the aggregate sums received according to category and the aggregate sums paid out according to each payee. A newspaper may publish other information from the records of the hospital as news items without cost to the hospital.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-608</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is necessary, in order to comply with this section, that a school district include in its financial statement receipts and disbursements for a cafeteria account.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-622</cite>.

       In reading all of subsection (1) of this section together, under the doctrine of in pari materia, it appears that this section does not apply to a district health department; this section emphasizes that those units of government which extract rates, charges, assessments or taxes from the public are brought under the statute. Thus, it would not apply to a district health department which received its funding from state, federal, county, and public health taxing district sources, and imposed no taxes or charges upon the public.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-335</cite>.

        Since the provisions of former law regarding the maximum amounts that could be expended by school boards for buildings, improvements and materials before being required to advertise for competitive bids were less than the amount provided for in this section as enacted in 1958, such former law was to that extent repealed and superseded by this section.

       Change orders as provided for in a contract for the construction of public school buildings are proper when they do not substantially alter the nature of the contract or may be regarded as matters incidental to or which relate to an integral part of the original contract and specifications, but if they are so great as to constitute a new construction contract or to deal with an unrelated matter, this proposition would not apply.<cite class=OAG>OAG 62-845</cite>.

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court could award a contract for certain items of hospital equipment and furnishings for a new hospital to the lowest bidder after it had made clarifications in the specifications, since the basic pricing device was not altered and because the cost change from manual beds to electric beds did not produce a substantial change in the specifications.<cite class=OAG>OAG 72-162</cite>.

       The competitive bidding procedure for insurance contracts set forth in this section should be utilized where the amount to be expended is more than $2,500, except in those situations where the premium rates and benefits are fixed by statute or ordinance, so as to eliminate any possible variation in rates, group life, disability and medical coverage insurance contracts, and other types of insurance contracts in which the premium rates and benefits may be competitive and vary from company to company, are not excepted from the bidding requirements as contracts for professional services.<cite class=OAG>OAG 73-367</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county’s needs for the application of bituminous materials in repairing its roads exceeded $2,500, the requirement of this section that bids be taken after advertisement could not be circumvented by splitting the total amount into several “rental” payments to the contractor.<cite class=OAG>OAG 73-415</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section would not apply to a contract by the fiscal court to purchase a private law library and office equipment for the total sum of $2,500 and therefore it would not be required to advertise for bids before executing such contract.<cite class=OAG>OAG 73-433</cite>.

       Where without observing this section the local school board was presented with claims for $281,207 for work on the construction of a new school building which was performed on the basis of an oral agreement between the contractor and the then school superintendent, none of the county’s revenue-sharing money can be legally spent in replacing the capital outlay fund money and school building fund money, which funds were illegally spent on a void contract, as this would be a violation of this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 73-684</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state board of education has enacted regulations for bidding on the purchase of school equipment and any bidding not conforming to these regulations can be reported to the superintendent of public instruction who is empowered by KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc156s156.132" target="_blank">156.132</a></cite> to make written charges against any superintendent or board member who is guilty of misconduct or unlawful acts.<cite class=OAG>OAG 73-740</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a school district advertised for bids and opened them at the specified time but delayed awarding a contract until some time not more than 90 days later, during which period of time a new wage rate was issued, since no changes were made in the contract price or work specifications and no justification was shown for an “emergency” authorizing waiver of the bidding statutes under this section, the wage rate to be paid by the contractor should be that in effect on the date of advertisement for bids and not the new rate that was in effect at the time bids were awarded.<cite class=OAG>OAG 73-744</cite>; 74-8.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purchase by a fiscal court of a county vehicle to be used by a senior citizens organization for an amount in excess of $2,500 is void unless it is let out on advertised newspaper bids stating the specifications desired.<cite class=OAG>OAG 74-107</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section’s requirement that local boards of education solicit bids for the purchase of gasoline need not be complied with during the effective duration of the federal petroleum allocation and price regulations which mandated that each school district retain its current gasoline supplier.<cite class=OAG>OAG 74-285</cite>; 76-600.
      </p>

      <p>
       There was no need for the board of education to advertise for bids on office space as the words “lease or other agreement for materials, supplies or equipment” do not cover such space.<cite class=OAG>OAG 74-404</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A proposed contract for addition to a hospital would not be valid under this section where the construction manager, if there were no other bids or all bids were in excess of the manager’s budgeted cost, would automatically end up with the contract.<cite class=OAG>OAG 74-420</cite>.

      <p>

      <p>
       The Board of Trustees of the Fire Protection District, rather than the chief of the fire department of the district under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc75s75.031" target="_blank">75.031</a></cite>, has the authority to contract for the purchase of fire equipment and the requirements of this section must be met if the contract involves an expenditure of more than $2,500 so that the Fire Protection District may legally purchase fire equipment from manufacturers for which the full-time fire chief of the Fire Protection District sells equipment when no commission or other remuneration is received by the chief in connection with purchase by the district and assuming that the statutory bidding requirements, if applicable, are observed.<cite class=OAG>OAG 74-880</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where hospital’s liability insurance has been cancelled the hospital if it desires to continue with liability insurance cannot accept the bid of the next lowest bidder but should let out a new contract by advertising for bids anew, pursuant to this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-19</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a school district purchases textbooks and materials under the provisions of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc156s156.400" target="_blank">156.400</a></cite> to<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc156s156.476" target="_blank">156.476,</a></cite> the statutory bidding procedures required by this section are not applicable.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-27</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a city in advertising bids for a sanitary landfill specified a cutoff time and date for the receipt of bids and after that time a city councilman turned over to the city clerk a bid on behalf of the bidder, it was improper for the councilman to deliver the bid and the bid could not be properly accepted by the city after the specified time, since, although not spelled out therein, this section by implication requires strict compliance by a city with its advertised bidding procedures.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-97</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a city in advertising bids specifies a cutoff time and date for the receipt of bids, the city clerk should time stamp all bids showing the precise time of receipt to document compliance with the advertised requirement.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-97</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fiscal court may, without advertising for bids, purchase from the county clerk materials and supplies not in excess of $2,500, providing this limitation in amount is not circumvented by splitting a larger purchase into “dribbles and dabs” of separate purchases.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-98</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An arrangement whereby a political subdivision enters into a negotiated price agreement for the construction of facilities is invalid where the bidding requirements of this section were not complied with prior to the commencement of construction.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-117</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agent of the fiscal court, in letting a contract for construction of county hospital facilities would have to comply with the bidding requirements of this section, regardless of the statutory financing method or methods employed, since a negotiated contract would be strictly illegal and void.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-482</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The services rendered by an auditor are professional services and therefore a board of education may employ an auditor without advertising for bids while “cleaning services” do not fall within the meaning of “professional” services and advertisement for bids involving an expenditure of more than $2,500 for cleaning services is statutorily required.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-488</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the cost of services in connection with the production of a school yearbook are as much as $2,500, then, in accordance with this section and Regulations 702 KAR 3:130 and 3:140, schools should advertise for bids and the expenditures must be supervised by the board of education which has the ultimate responsibility.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-618</cite> (affirming<cite class=OAG>OAG 66-51</cite>, 66-228 and 66-417).
      </p>
      <p>
       A contract for the printing of supplies for county elections is not required to be given to the newspaper having the largest circulation and, therefore, may be given to any other newspaper as long as it is located in the county in conformance with KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.07.html#tVIIc57s57.285" target="_blank">57.285</a></cite>, but if the printing costs exceed $2,500 then the contract must be let on a bid basis.<cite class=OAG>OAG 75-711</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bidding requirement cannot be avoided by buying a small amount each month where it is known that certain supplies will be needed over a period of several months, and in such a case, the fiscal court should estimate aggregate needs in advance.<cite class=OAG>OAG 76-9</cite>.

       The fiscal court has the power to purchase all property for the county out of the county treasury including any equipment purchased for the use of the office of sheriff or for any other county constitutional office and where necessary official purchases are made out of excess fees of county constitutional officers for use of those offices, the fiscal court has the authority to require that such purchases be made by the central purchasing officer established by the fiscal court to effect county purchases after such purchases are authorized by fiscal court orders.<cite class=OAG>OAG 76-390</cite>.

       Where the county court clerk caused an advertisement to be placed in a local paper stating that the fiscal court was seeking bids on gasoline, fuel oil and labor for repairing county equipment, but no mention was made of the fiscal court’s right to reject any and all bids and the fiscal court had not expressed an intent to seek bids and bid specifications were not prepared by them, but in response to the advertisement, two service stations submitted bids, one of which was accepted by the fiscal court even though they were unaware of the clerk’s advertisement, the county court clerk acted in absence of any instructions or directions from the fiscal court when he placed the advertisement, and the fiscal court, even though it initially accepted one of the bids, may, after discovering the improper act of the county court clerk and its own failure to authorize the purchase of the items bid upon, revoke the contract if one was made or reject the bids submitted.<cite class=OAG>OAG 76-476</cite>.

       In determining whether a contract involving backhoe work is for more than $2,500 and thus subject to the bidding requirement, a city cannot add the value of other services and materials not related to that work such as wages of city employees or materials obtained through other contracts.<cite class=OAG>OAG 76-521</cite>.

      <p>
       A procedure followed by a board of education in awarding contracts for construction, repair and maintenance services that may develop in the future would not comply with this section which contemplates contracts where job specifications are advertised for a specific project and bids are received containing a firm total cost figure.<cite class=OAG>OAG 76-661</cite>.

       In receiving bids for construction of a branch library, a public library district could not award the contracts on the basis of the base bids only and then automatically accept the alternates desired at the prices submitted by the chosen low base bidder, but instead must award the specific contracts on the basis of the sum of the base bid plus the desired alternates.<cite class=OAG>OAG 77-428</cite>.

      <p>
       A city may hire the necessary personnel and lease the needed equipment to install waterlines, but if the equipment to be leased involves an expenditure of more than $2,500 the city must follow the bidding requirements set forth in this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 77-458</cite>.

       Inasmuch as insurance contracts involve a “professional” service rather than a personal service of a manual or mechanical nature, a city may obtain insurance coverage without making a newspaper advertisement for bids.<cite class=OAG>OAG 77-599</cite>.

       A sewer and water board is an agency of the city and would be required to advertise for bids pursuant to this section where the contract involved more than $5,000.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-95</cite>.

      <p>
       This section requiring competitive bidding is mandatory and where applicable it must be observed in good faith by the local governmental authorities so that the legislative body responsible for letting bids cannot circumvent the statute by buying needed supplies in “dribbles and dabs.”<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-121</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, the fiscal court has discretion in applying this section during the duration of awarded bid contract; however, it cannot, in considering the purpose of the bidding statute, act arbitrarily, capriciously or unreasonably and where the fiscal court desired to continue under an existing petroleum contract, whether or not they were acting arbitrarily or capriciously in failing to relet the bids on petroleum products would be determined by the courts.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-121</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is illegal for a city to figure its gasoline needs for one day and thus avoid advertising for bids; rather, a city should calculate its gasoline needs for at least a one-year period and advertise for bids if the costs will exceed $5,000.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-166</cite>.

      <p>
       The fact that roads are in poor condition as the result of a bad winter was not unforeseeable and was not of emergency status so as to justify the purchasing of trucks for the county road system without a letting of bids if the cost exceeds $5,000.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-280</cite>.

       Where a city offered to pay to blacktop the driveway of leased premises in exchange for such lease, if the city itself was responsible for blacktopping the driveway, making it necessary for it to obtain by contract the necessary materials and equipment to do the job, then this section would be applicable since it applies to all purchases of material and equipment by a city.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-357</cite>.

       The term “professional services” as used in this section refers to those services furnished by a physician, lawyer, engineer, artist, architect, etc.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-725</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “professional services” could in no way include the furnishing of computer billing services contemplated by an electric plant board and, as a consequence, the board would be required to advertise for bids for this type of service in compliance with this section, assuming of course that the cost of such services will exceed $5,000.<cite class=OAG>OAG 78-725</cite>.
      </p>

       Where a fiscal court sought bids for both 12- and 18-inch steel, and got bids from one bidder of $2.00 and $3.00 respectively, and of $2.25 and $2.90 respectively from another, it would be necessary to reject both bids and ask for new and separate bids, since under the initial bids it would be impractical to determine a low bidder.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-138</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not a fiscal court could reimburse a private citizen for money he spent for work on a public way would depend on whether the cost of the work exceeded $5,000; if it did, this section would have required a bid which did not take place, thus preventing reimbursement; but if it was less than $5,000, then it is in the discretion of the fiscal court to do so.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-138</cite>.

       Nothing prevents the delegation of authority to make purchases, up to a certain level less than $5,000, to the county judge/executive, subject to final fiscal court approval, being placed in the administrative code.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-179</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a city-county office building was in dire need of a new roof and bids were twice advertised for with no one making a bid, a resolution declaring an emergency could properly be passed and noncompetitive negotiations entered into despite the fact that such work would involve an expenditure substantially more than $5,000.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-304</cite>.

       The provisions of the Model Procurement Code (KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.385" target="_blank">45A.385</a></cite>) must govern over this section as amended since the Procurement Code is a detailed, comprehensive and specific kind of legislation as contrasted with the short, skeletal and general provisions of this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-429</cite>; 79-447.
      </p>
      <p>
       A firm selected as construction manager for a project could also bid competitively on other phases of the construction work, since the services and work to be performed legitimately can be broken down into various parts or phases.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-501</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A local school board may directly purchase items or equipment, for a construction project, by competitive bidding, which it would then have installed by others under separate competitive bids.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-501</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The position of a construction manager over a construction project constitutes professional services and would therefore not be subject to competitive bidding.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-501</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no express provision in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc273" target="_blank">Chapter 273</a></cite> or in this section that required a nonprofit, nonstock corporation to observe the bidding process.<cite class=OAG>OAG 79-577</cite>.

       Where a county fiscal court has formally adopted the Model Procurement Code, the provisions of that code apply to the con- struction of a personal care home on behalf of a tenant, which will be a Kentucky nonprofit corporation, the funding of which construction will be effected by a revenue bond issue of fiscal court pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc103s103.200" target="_blank">103.200</a></cite>; however, where the fiscal court has taken no formal action to come under the Model Pro- curement Code, the code does not apply, and this section, requiring bidding on the construction contract, would apply.<cite class=OAG>OAG 80-297</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a county has not adopted the Model Procurement Code, the procurement of the services of a public accountant or certified public accountant, in order to audit the county’s funds, would not require formal bidding procedure.<cite class=OAG>OAG 80-624</cite>.

       A county metropolitan sewer district may, whether operating under this section, the bidding statute, or KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.345" target="_blank">45A.345</a></cite>, the model procurement code, adopt a “Buy American” clause, which requires a contractor or supplier to furnish only goods manufactured in America, as a standard procurement policy, included in all purchasing contracts and bid specifications.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-34</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court of a county may lease a portion of the tobacco base owned by the county to individuals, since the power of the court under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.080" target="_blank">67.080</a></cite> to sell real property includes the power to lease, and the lease of county property does not come under the competitive bidding requirements of this section and the Model Procurement Code, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45A" target="_blank">Chapter 45A</a></cite>, since the bidding principle applies only to governmental acquisitions, not situations where the government is the lessor; however, the lease must contain the precise consideration given, since the fiscal court must make full public disclosure of its transactions.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-107</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a fiscal court has specifically adopted the Kentucky Model Procurement Code, pursuant to KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.350" target="_blank">45A.350</a></cite> (repealed), it must, under subdivision (23) of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.345" target="_blank">45A.345</a></cite>, purchase insurance under a competitive bidding system, even though this section excepts professional services such as insurance from competitive bidding.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-109</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county fiscal court, in a county which has not adopted the Kentucky Model Procurement Code under KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.350" target="_blank">45A.350</a></cite> (repealed), may participate in a self-insuring workers’ compensation trust in connection with a workers’ compensation benefits program for hospital workers without letting out the insurance contracts under a competitive bidding procedure, since failure to adopt the procurement code leaves the fiscal court free under this section to let the contract without bidding.<cite class=OAG>OAG 81-117</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that a county fiscal court has not adopted KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.345" target="_blank">45A.345</a></cite> to 45A.460 of the Kentucky Model Procurement Code, then this section applies to the purchase of its gasoline, petroleum, and other supplies used by the county road department.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-125</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A statutory requirement of advertisement for bids is “jurisdictional,” and a fiscal court is without power to enter into a contract without such advertisement, where the purchase requires bidding. Further, a party deals with a public agency at its peril if it contracts with an agency and fails to inquire into the power of the agency to execute such contract.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-125</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number of months’ supply of any needed commodity which must be considered for bidding purposes is, because of its nature, a matter that must be left to the sound administrative discretion of the fiscal court.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-125</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The matter of letting out for bids the gasoline and oil needed for the county road department is left to the good business judgment of the fiscal court in terms of the period of consumption, price fluctuations, availability of the commodity for a definite period, etc. However, a fiscal court should not deliberately buy the needed commodities in “dribbles and dabs” merely to circumvent advertised bidding.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-125</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The three important benefits of the bidding process are: (a) an offering to the public, (b) an opportunity for competition and (c) a basis for an exact comparison of bids.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-125</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no conflict between this section and the model Procurement Code, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45A" target="_blank">Chapter 45A</a></cite>, concerning the necessity of school boards taking competitive bids for general liability insurance since local school districts, as local public agencies, have a choice whether to operate with respect to their procurement needs under either the local Model Procurement Code or this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-170</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not require general liability insurance for school districts to be competitively bid.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-170</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The emergency clause of Acts 1982, ch. 282, which amended this section among others, related solely to § 3 of the act which amended KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.335" target="_blank">45A.335</a></cite> to exclude members of state boards and commissions from the term “officer or employe,” as used in the conflict of interest statute, KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.340ol15" target="_blank">45A.340(5)</a></cite>; it not only did not relate to the other sections of the bill, which were separable, but it gave no reason to justify that an emergency existed with respect to these sections. In view of the fact that the Ky. Const., § 55 requires an act to express in plain language what the emergency is in order for it to be effective only § 3 became effective on April 2, 1982, upon the passage of the act and approval of the governor, and the remaining sections of the act became effective as ordinary legislation on July 15, 1982.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-308</cite>.

       A fiscal court, governed by this section (that is, any fiscal court not adopting KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.345" target="_blank">45A.345</a></cite> to 45A.460), may effect purchases up to $7,500 without formal bidding procedure.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-324</cite>.

      <p>
       Although site work can be, and is usually interpreted to be, a part of a project involving school building construction or remodeling, site work unrelated to school building construction does not come within the scope of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc162s162.070" target="_blank">162.070</a></cite>. Thus, where a school district wished to correct a drainage problem at one of its schools, this section and the $7,500 “small purchases” ceiling was applicable to the contract for drainage site work.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-407</cite>.

       To the extent that KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc162s162.070" target="_blank">162.070</a></cite> and this section are in conflict, the provisions and therefore the $7,500 amount found in this section, as amended in 1982, must be deemed to prevail over the lower $5,000 amount remaining in KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc162s162.070" target="_blank">162.070</a></cite>.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-407</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, a cafeteria plan of insurance coverage for school teachers need not be bid; under the Model Procurement Code if a contract is for group life insurance, group health and accident insurance, group professional liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, and unemployment insurance, the contract may be noncompetitively negotiated.<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-151</cite>.

       A fiscal court resolution requiring that tiles and tires be purchased from the cheapest places in the county is in restrictive conflict with this section and KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.365ol15" target="_blank">45A.365(5)</a></cite> and is invalid.<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-258</cite>.

      <p>
       If the reconstructing or paving of separate county road segments could involve unified specifications and work performance of such nature that bids on the total number of projects as a total package could be obtained, the total work should be let under advertisement for bids, pursuant to this section or KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45A" target="_blank">Chapter 45A</a></cite>, whichever is applicable to the county; however, if the fiscal court determines upon investigation that lump sum bids upon the total projects cannot be obtained from the road construction trade, then the various road segments should be treated as legally and factually separate and bidding would be necessary for any of the projects if they exceed for a single project the sum of $5,000 (if the Model Procurement Code applies in the county) or exceeds $7,500 (if this section applies in the county).<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-316</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       No county fee officer can engage in a bidding contract of purchase of supplies or equipment, i.e., binding on the county where the money for the purchase is to come directly out of the county treasury; the fiscal court is the authority in contracting for county supplies or equipment, payable out of the county treasury.<cite class=OAG>OAG 83-448</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should a fee officer have to purchase items of equipment or personal property that are not consumable but will have a reasonable life span, such as motor vehicles, the title would be taken in the name of the county and the purchases would be subject to the county’s handling of the purchases and applicable provisions relating to bidding law under this section or KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45A" target="_blank">Chapter 45A</a></cite> (where the fiscal court has adopted the provisions of KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45As45A.345" target="_blank">45A.345</a></cite> through 45A.460).

      </p>
      <p>
       A unit of government, in connection with the demands of a bidding statute, cannot divide the work and let it under several contracts so as to circumvent the bidding requirement, thus where the transactions are not legally and factually severable, they cannot be manipulated to circumvent the declared bidding policy of this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-57</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though a riverport authority is created jointly by a city and county, the created authority is still a body politic and corporate, it is still a special district and, thus, the district, i.e., the riverport authority, is subject to the bidding principle under this section, or the Model Procurement Code if adopted by the authority.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-196</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>

       A city’s expenditure of $10,000 for the services of a professional engineer to survey and engineer a sewer line installation project falls within the category of professional services exempt from bidding under the terms of this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 84-274</cite>.

      <p>
       If reasonably detailed specifications describing the scope of a project are first prepared, such that competing potential bidders can know with particularity the product for which a bid might be tendered, and bids are solicited in relation to those specifications in conformity with KRS<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc424s424.130" target="_self">424.130</a></cite>, and<cite class=ocky><a href="#tXXXVIIIc424s424.140" target="_self">424.140,</a></cite> the design/build approach to construction procurement might be utilized by a county.<cite class=OAG>OAG 92-143</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the construction inspector hired by the board of education is merely inspecting the building constructed by the general contractor and reporting back to the board, and the contract specifically releases the construction inspector from any responsibility for the actual construction of the school, these activities did not constitute professional services. The construction inspector lacked the necessary decision-making responsibility. Since the construction inspector was not considered to be supplying professional services, he was not exempt from the bidding requirements of this section.<cite class=OAG>OAG 92-144</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where self-insured groups of Kentucky Association of Counties contracted with third party administrators to provide professional services involving the use of training, discretion, and judgment in the field of insurance, such professional services contracts may be entered into without any type of open bid.<cite class=OAG>OAG 94-1</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where bid invitation contained no indication of either the quantity of materials to be purchased nor the projects for which the materials would be used, the bid invitation did not grant reasonable notice of county’s intentions and did not comply with the statute.<cite class=OAG>OAG 94-20</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Documents tendered as part of competitive sealed bidding become open public records at the time the bids are opened, even if the bids are rejected. Public disclosure of bid documents associated with a competitive sealed bid can not be delayed until the contracting public agency determined whether to move to competitive negotiation, and if a determination is made to proceed into competitive negotiation, the original bid documents can not be considered part of the negotiation process and remain closed until a contract is awarded or negotiations are cancelled. OAG 05-ORD-001.
      </p>
      <p>
       A local public agency that has not adopted the Model Procurement Code is not required to follow competitive bidding procedures for insurance, and may contract with an insurance broker to solicit and receive bids for insurance, although competitive bidding remains preferred. A local public agency that has adopted the Model Procurement Code must follow all applicable provisions in seeking contracts with insurance brokers.<cite class=OAG>OAG 13-006</cite>.

       Acts 1982, ch. 430, which amends this section and several other statutes relating to publication requirements of cities, is basically an amendment of the municipal publication requirements and does not affect the city budget process, financial matters in cities or matters relating to the administration of city finances. It gives a city a choice as to which of two devices relating to finances and expenditures must be published annually rather than requiring that they both be published and affects what a city publishes after the completion of the fiscal year, but does not affect the activities of a city during the fiscal year; it does not impair any vested rights.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-353</cite>.

       As to its publication provisions for municipal governments, Acts 1982, ch. 430, effective July 15, 1982, is applicable to those municipal governments for the fiscal year July 1, 1981 to June 30, 1982.<cite class=OAG>OAG 82-353</cite>.
