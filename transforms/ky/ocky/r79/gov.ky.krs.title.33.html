        Petition, in action by beneficiaries of trust against trustee, seeking to recover value of original trust securities which trustee had exchanged for stock of holding company which later went bankrupt sufficiently stated a cause of action, where it alleged that the trustee was financially interested in holding company and made the change for selfish interests, that the trustee was familiar with the hazards involved in the holding company structure, and that after the trust had been terminated and the stock delivered to the beneficiaries the holding company “became insolvent and its stock worthless,” although the petition did not specifically allege that the stock was worthless at the time it was turned over to the beneficiaries.

     Deposits in fiduciary’s personal account.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If a fiduciary makes a deposit in a bank or trust company to his personal credit of checks drawn by him upon an account in his own name as fiduciary, or of checks payable to him as fiduciary, or of checks drawn by him upon an account in the name of his principal if he is empowered to draw checks thereon, or of checks payable to his principal and endorsed by him if he is empowered to endorse them, or if he otherwise makes a deposit of funds held by him as fiduciary, the bank or trust company receiving the deposit is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing thereby a breach of his obligation as fiduciary. The bank or trust company may pay the amount of the deposit or any part thereof upon the personal check of the fiduciary without being liable to the principal, unless it receives the deposit or pays the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in making the deposit or in drawing the check or with knowledge of such facts that its action in receiving the deposit or paying the check amounts to bad faith.

        The fact that personal checks drawn by administrator on his personal account, in which he had deposited certain checks payable to him as administrator, and at a time when his own funds were insufficient, contained notations indicating that they were “for” certain purposes which were probably personal was not sufficient to charge bank with knowledge that the administrator was committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary, or to charge the bank with bad faith.

In subsection (2)(a) of this statute, a reference to “paragraph (f)” has been changed to read “paragraph (g).” In subsection (3)(d) of this statute, a reference to “paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section” has been changed to read “subsection (2)(b) of this section.” These corrections are clearly required by the context and by examination of changes in paragraph designations that were adopted in successive drafts of 2012 Ky. Acts ch. 59, sec. 2. The Reviser of Statutes has corrected these manifest clerical or technical errors under KRS 7.136(1).
     </p>
     
     <p>
      (7/12/2006).
    2006 Ky. Acts ch. 247 instructs the Reviser of Statutes to adjust KRS references throughout the statutes to conform with the 2006 renumbering of the Financial Services Code, KRS Chapter 286. Such an adjustment has been made in this statute.
     </p>
     
     <p>
      (1/1/2005). In 2004 Ky. Acts ch. 158, sec. 3, subsec. (2), a reference is made to “subsection (1) of this Act.” Because it is clear from the subject matter of ch. 158, sec. 3, subsec. (1), that the reference was intended to be to “subsection (1) of this section” instead, this manifest clerical or typographical error has been corrected during codification by the Reviser of Statutes under KRS 7.136(1).

        A mother of a handicapped child had failed to obtain legal authority to fund and manage a trust, which was funded by a settlement received from those allegedly responsible for the child’s condition, as she was not appointed by the District Court, did not obtain approval of the trust, failed to file settlements or accountings, and administered the trust with no court supervision and control; nevertheless, her ex-husband was not entitled to half of the trust funds upon the child’s death under the laws of descent and devise because his parental rights had been previously terminated.

        Where stepmother of infant children had given them every advantage in the way of care, education and devotion, and had supported them and built up a good home and business while their father was in prison, court properly appointed her as guardian, after death of children’s father, in preference to uncle of children, who failed to prove claim that stepmother was of unsuitable morals. The fact that stepmother was making a claim to certain property antagonistic to interests of children did not disqualify her, where the claim could not be established without proof by testimony other than her own.

        District Court’s ruling that it was in the best interests of a child that her maternal aunt and uncle rather than her paternal aunt and uncle be named as her co-guardians and co-conservators was supported by substantial evidence; while all of the parties loved the child and wanted to provide for her, the child was in need of a mother figure and the maternal aunt, who was the sister of the child’s mother, was the best choice particularly in light of the fact that the child’s father had murdered the child’s mother.

        At oral request of surety, guardian, in surety’s absence, procured a new bond with another surety. Court order on filing of second bond declared surety on first bond was relieved from further liability. Court’s action in permitting giving of second bond was merely equivalent to requiring new bond as additional security, and all sureties on both bonds were equally and jointly liable. Barker v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where guardian failed to file inventory within the required period, failed to settle accounts for five years, was extravagant and wasteful in managing the ward’s estate, removal of guardian was justified. Clay's Guardian v. Clay, 89 S.W. 500, 28
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. L. Rptr. 398

       </p>
       <p>
        A motion to remove a guardian may be made at the instance of the ward, or another having the right to represent him, or upon the court’s own motion. Clay's Guardian v. Clay, 89 S.W. 500, 28

       <p>
        When a guardian has been duly appointed and has qualified by taking the oath and executing the bond as required by law, he may not at the mere caprice or whim of the court or some complaining party be removed, but only can be removed for some cause or causes enumerated by statute or recognized by law.

        Residual beneficiary’s assertion that the beneficiary was entitled to an accounting because the executrix failed in the executor’s reporting requirements appeared to have been based solely upon the beneficiary’s perception that the executrix must have written the decedent’s will. As such, the beneficiary’s claim was insufficient to trigger an accounting. Van Meter Boone v. Hoskins, 2020

     </h3>
     <p>
      When a minor or other person under disability, having no guardian or conservator, is entitled to receive a sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), exclusive of interest, in any action in which real estate has been sold or in the settlement of any estate or from any other source, the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability may settle or compromise the dollar amount when in the interest of the minor or other person under disability. The court in which the action is pending, or, if the sum does not derive from the action, the District Court, may order the sum to be paid to the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability. Before entering the order, the court shall approve any settlement or compromise and shall be satisfied by affidavit or oral testimony that the minor or other person under disability is in the custody of the person to whom it is proposed to pay the money and the latter, upon withdrawal of the money, shall be under obligation as trustee to expend it, for the support, maintenance, or education of the minor or other person under disability. When the order is made, no bond shall be required of the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability and the purchaser of the real property may pay the share of the minor or other person under disability into court, and no lien shall remain on the property therefor and the money may be withdrawn by the person mentioned in the order without that person giving bond.

       No appointment of a guardian ad litem shall be made until the defendant is summoned, or until a person is summoned for him, as is authorized by law; nor until an affidavit of the plaintiff, or of his attorney, be filed in court, or with the clerk, showing that the defendant has no guardian, curator, nor conservator, residing in this state, known to the affiant.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387s387.305ol12">
       A guardian ad litem must be a regular, practicing attorney of the court and may be appointed by the court, whether a guardian, curator, or conservator appear for the defendant or not. The guardian ad litem may be appointed upon the motion of the plaintiff or of any friend of the defendant; but neither the plaintiff nor his attorney shall be appointed, nor be permitted to suggest the name of the proposed guardian ad litem; and the court may change the guardian so appointed whenever the interest of the infant may appear to require such change.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387s387.305ol13">
       It shall be the duty of the guardian ad litem to attend properly to the preparation of the case; and in an ordinary action he may cause as many witnesses to be subpoenaed as he may think proper, subject to the control of the court; and in an equitable action he may take depositions, not, however, exceeding three (3), without leave of the court.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387s387.305ol14">
       The court shall allow to the guardian ad litem a reasonable fee for his services, to be paid by the plaintiff and taxed in the costs. The affidavit of such guardian, or of another person, or other competent evidence, is admissible to prove the services rendered, but not to prove their value. The court must decide concerning such value, without reference to the opinions of parties or other witnesses.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387s387.305ol15">
       Whether appointed pursuant to this statute or pursuant to a provision of the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code, the duties of a guardian ad litem shall be to advocate for the client’s best interest in the proceeding through which the guardian ad litem was appointed. Without an appointment, the guardian ad litem shall have no obligation to initiate action or to defend the client in other proceedings.

       <p>
        The appointment of a guardian ad litem is a matter within the discretion of the court where the guardian’s interest may be adverse to the ward’s. Adams v. De Dominguez, 129
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. 599

       </p>
       <p>
        A guardian ad litem is both a fiduciary and a lawyer of the infant and, in a special sense, the representative of the court to protect the minor. Black v. Wiedeman, 254 S.W.2d 344, 1952
        <cite class="ky_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        A guardian ad litem who was appointed to receive service of process has no authority to defend the infant in an adoption action. Stanfield v. Willoughby, 269 S.W.2d 270, 1954

        In fixing a fee for a guardian ad litem, the character of the litigation; the rights in controversy; the nature, duration and extent of the services; the responsibility, industry, diligence and accomplishment of the guardian; the general methods of evaluating attorneys’ fees; and an allowance for services, if any, in the Court of Appeals should be considered.

      The chairman of the guardianship subcommittee of the 1980-82 Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary Statutes, in a letter to the Deputy Director and Reviser of Statutes, dated 2-7-86, has stated as follows: “As indicated in Senate Bill 35, in Section 1, ‘Guardianship and conservatorship for disabled persons shall be utilized only as is necessary to promote their well-being, including protection from neglect, exploitation and abuse.’”
     </p>
     
     <p>
      “It was the intent of Senate Bill 35 that guardianship and conservatorship for disabled persons be established only when necessary and if partial guardianship or conservatorship was appropriate, it was preferable. It certainly was not our intent that every disabled person have a guardian or conservator appointed.

        The purpose of this section is to appoint a person to take care of the day-to-day personal business of an incompetent. The scope of authority, duties and accountability of a guardian is much broader than that of a traditional power of attorney, even one intended to survive disability. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989

        The sections dealing with guardianship for disabled persons are remedial rather than exclusive in nature, where the intent was to provide services for incompetent persons not only as specifically articulated but also as reasonably inferable from the nature of the powers of a guardian.

       <p>
        A guardian is answerable to a court and must file accountings at least annually; the attorney-in-fact is answerable and accountable only to the principal who may be mentally disabled. It is obvious that there must be adequate safeguards and control on the person who manages an incompetent’s estate and that a great disparity exists between the durable power of attorney and a guardian.

       <p>
        The durable power of attorney is not a substitute for the appointment of a guardian. The existence of a durable power of attorney cannot prevent the institution of guardianship proceedings. The disabled person is entitled to have the district court exercise control and supervision of her estate by the impaneling of a jury to determine whether she is disabled pursuant to chapter 387 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes and if so to appoint a guardian in accordance with that chapter, and if a fiduciary is appointed then the power of attorney-in-fact shall terminate and an account must be given to the court-appointed fiduciary.

        In a wrongful death case against a nursing home, an arbitration agreement was not valid because parents could not enter a contract on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no actual authority on the part of the parents to enter into a contract on behalf of the daughter, a signatory was not a guardian of the disabled adult, and the parents could not appoint the signatory as a power of attorney; even though the parents had the right to make health care decisions under KRS 311.631(1), entering into an arbitration agreement was not a health care decision. Because the parents were unable to name an attorney-in-fact on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no apparent authority either. GGNSC Stanford, LLC v. Rowe, 388 S.W.3d 117, 2012

      The county is responsible for payment of the examiners’ fees where a respondent dies after an examination is completed but prior to trial, and in cases where a jury determines the respondent not to be disabled since the mandatory language of subsection (8) of this section requires payment of the examiners’ fees by the county in all cases.

        The durable power of attorney is not a substitute for the appointment of a guardian. The existence of a durable power of attorney cannot prevent the institution of guardianship proceedings. The disabled person is entitled to have the District Court exercise control and supervision of her estate by the impaneling of a jury to determine whether she is disabled pursuant to chapter 387 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes and if so to appoint a guardian in accordance with that chapter, and if a fiduciary is appointed then the power of attorney-in-fact shall terminate and an account must be given to the court-appointed fiduciary.

       <p>
        By the repeal of KRS Chapter 203, the General Assembly intended to place the filing of disability judgments and the indexing of same as a responsibility of the circuit clerk, instead of the county clerk. Thus on and after July 1, 1982, there is no statutory basis for filing disability judgments and indexing them in the county clerk’s office.

       <p>
        The effect of subsection (8) of this section is that the judgment of disability or partial disability must be filed in the District Court. Thus the Circuit Court-District Court clerk must see to it that such judgments are filed in the clerk’s office; and the circuit clerk must establish, on and after July 1, 1982, an index system covering such judgments collected in a book identifiable as involving notices of actions and encumbrances.

        Subsection (8) of this section when read as a whole, requires that a certified copy of the judgment of disability must be filed in the county clerk’s office for unless this is done, notice to any subsequent bona fide purchaser for value, mortgagee, or encumbrancer will not be afforded.

        Concerning the county clerk’s fee for filing and indexing a certified copy of a disability judgment under subsection (8) of this section, the proper fee for the county clerks to accompany such filing and indexing is five dollars for filing miscellaneous documents for which no specific fee is set, where the record does not exceed three pages; where such document exceeds three pages, for each additional page the clerk’s fee is one dollar and fifty cents.

        Based upon the provisions of KRS 387.560(3) and this section, it is not the responsibility of the county attorney to advocate on behalf of the appointment of any person who has applied for appointment as guardian or conservator; KRS 387.560(3) does not require the county attorney to represent any petitioner within the connotation of an adversary proceeding, but merely requires the county attorney to assist the petitioner in the preparation and filing of the petition.

      A guardian of a disabled person shall have the following powers and duties, except as modified by order of the court:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387-guardianshipandconservatorshipfordisabledpersonss387.660ol11">
       To establish the ward’s place of abode within the state, except that, if at any time a guardian places a ward in a licensed residential facility for developmentally disabled persons, the guardian shall, within thirty (30) days of such placement, file with the court notice of the placement, stating with specificity the reasons for such placement, and an interdisciplinary evaluation report detailing the social, psychological, medical or other considerations on which such placement is predicated, a description of the treatment or habilitation programs which will benefit the ward as a result of such placement, and a determination that such placement will provide appropriate treatment in the least restrictive available treatment and residential program. For purposes of this subsection, the interdisciplinary evaluation report may be one performed within two (2) months prior to the placement for purposes of determining whether such placement is necessary and appropriate, or may be an evaluation and assessment provided by the residential facility immediately after placement. Notice to the court shall not be required where the ward is transferred from one licensed residential facility to another;
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387-guardianshipandconservatorshipfordisabledpersonss387.660ol12">
       To make provision for the ward’s care, comfort, and maintenance and arrange for such educational, social, vocational, and rehabilitation services as are appropriate and as will assist the ward in the development of maximum self-reliance and independence;
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387-guardianshipandconservatorshipfordisabledpersonss387.660ol13">
       To give any necessary consent or approval to enable the ward to receive medical or other professional care, counsel, treatment or service, except that a guardian may not consent on behalf of a ward to an abortion, sterilization, psychosurgery, removal of a bodily organ, or amputation of a limb unless the procedure is first approved by order of the court or is necessary, in an emergency situation, to preserve the life or prevent serious impairment of the physical health of the ward;
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387-guardianshipandconservatorshipfordisabledpersonss387.660ol14">
       To act with respect to the ward in a manner which limits the deprivation of civil rights and restricts his personal freedom only to the extent necessary to provide needed care and services to him; and
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387-guardianshipandconservatorshipfordisabledpersonss387.660ol15">

      If a separate limited conservator or conservator has been appointed for the ward, the expenditure of funds by the limited guardian shall be consistent with the duties assigned to and procedures and policies established by such limited conservator or conservator. Conflicts arising between a limited guardian and a limited conservator or conservator regarding the expenditure of funds which are unable to be otherwise resolved shall be submitted to the court for resolution.

        The sections dealing with guardianship for disabled persons are remedial rather than exclusive in nature, where the intent was to provide services for incompetent persons not only as specifically articulated but also as reasonably inferable from the nature of the powers of a guardian. DeGrella v. Elston, 858 S.W.2d 698, 1993

       <p>
        The right to withdrawal of medical treatment for a person in a persistent vegetative state exists within the framework of the individual’s common law rights of self-determination and informed consent in obtaining medical treatment, and these rights can be exercised by an incompetent person through the process of surrogate decision-making so long as the wishes of the patient were known.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a wrongful death case against a nursing home, an arbitration agreement was not valid because parents could not enter a contract on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no actual authority on the part of the parents to enter into a contract on behalf of the daughter, a signatory was not a guardian of the disabled adult, and the parents could not appoint the signatory as a power of attorney; even though the parents had the right to make health care decisions under KRS 311.631(1), entering into an arbitration agreement was not a health care decision. Because the parents were unable to name an attorney-in-fact on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no apparent authority either. GGNSC Stanford, LLC v. Rowe, 388 S.W.3d 117, 2012
        <cite class="ky_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        Guardian has the authority to enter into collateral agreements which may affect the jural rights of her ward, and a guardian’s decision to execute an optional arbitration agreement must be in the ward’s best interest. Therefore, arbitration could have been compelled in a negligence and personal injury case because a guardian had the authority to execute an optional arbitration agreement on behalf of her ward for admission to a long-term care facility.

        A judgment confirming a decretal judicial sale of the vested real property of an infant would not be reversed upon appeal for the single reason that the judgment under which the sale was made was erroneous and was reversed after the sale was made and confirmed and deed made to purchaser, where the court which rendered the judgment decreeing the sale had competent jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter of the action, and the sale was regularly and fairly made, to a bona fide purchaser.

        Bona fide purchaser of land of infant, the sale of which was later declared void, who placed lasting and valuable improvements on it under the good-faith belief that he owns its perfect title, may, as against the true owner, have a lien on it, not for their cost, but to the extent that they have enhanced its vendible value, not to exceed their cost.

        A judgment selling the land of infants is void only if the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject or the parties, all of whom must be treated as being of full legal capacity, and, accordingly, mere irregularities and even prejudicial errors of reversible magnitude cannot overthrow a judgment on the ground of voidness, provided the rendering court had jurisdiction of the suit’s subject and parties.

        An untrue affidavit for appointment of a warning order attorney for an infant owner of real property who was not a nonresident but was merely absent in military service does not make an uncontested judgment for the sale of such real estate void, but merely voidable, and where the judgment is not appealed within 90 days of the infant’s discharge from military service such defect is waived.

     Limitation on power of fiduciary to sell or mortgage property — Circuit clerk may alter.

     <p>
      In the event the power of a fiduciary to sell or mortgage any real estate is expressly limited by the will or trust instrument under which he is acting, such limitation may only be altered or amended by the Circuit Court of the county wherein the fiduciary was appointed, or if the fiduciary is acting under an agreement of trust without court supervision, the county in which the trust is or could be registered, in an action brought by the fiduciary in which all persons having a present or contingent interest in the property interest sought to be sold or mortgaged or its proceeds are made parties. Before adjudging that the fiduciary may deviate from the terms of the will or trust the court shall determine that there exist circumstances apparently unknown to the testator or settlor; that such circumstances would substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes intended; and that deviation is in the best interests of all parties concerned.

A fiduciary possessing a power of sale may institute such an action against owners of interests not represented by him. Defendant owners shall be brought before the court in the manner provided by the civil rules whether or not a fiduciary possesses a power of sale of the defendant’s interest, but any fiduciary possessing such a power shall also be made a defendant.

        Neither the failure of the court to take proof as to the indivisibility of the land nor the question as to whether it could have been divided without material impairment of its value were matters upon which the infant or purchasers could rely to set aside the sale, since the infant was not prejudiced, as the judgment compensated her for the value of her contingent right of dower in her husband’s part of the land, and the commissioner, as directed by the judgment, took a separate bond from the purchasers of the sale payable to himself for the value of her dower, out of which she would be paid; and, the question whether the land could have been divided between the joint owners, instead of being sold, was one in which the purchasers were not concerned.

        It is beyond the power of the court to approve an offer; rather the function of the court is to approve a sale pursuant to a binding offer, not to try to breathe life into a dead offer, and a judgment approving a sale “in accordance with the terms and conditions of said contract” when there was no contract was obviously a nullity.
