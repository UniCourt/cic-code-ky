       Where the trustees of the policemen’s and firemen’s pension fund of a city of the fourth class sought to turn over all of the assets of the pension fund to an insurance company to invest and administer pursuant to the pension fund act in the place of the board, it was doubtful that such a procedure would be legal under the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc95s95.768" target="_blank">95.768</a></cite> et seq., but investment of pension fund money in interest-producing stock of insurance companies would most likely be permissible.<cite class="OAG">OAG 71-154</cite>.

      </p>

       KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc41s41.220" target="_blank">41.220</a></cite>,<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc41s41.380" target="_blank">41.380</a></cite> (now KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc42s42.500" target="_blank">42.500</a></cite>),<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc386s386.010" target="_self">386.010</a></cite> and this section should be read together, i.e., in pari materia, since they concern the same subject matter.<cite class="OAG">OAG 81-353</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The State Investment Commission, in carrying out its investment function under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc41s41.380" target="_blank">41.380</a></cite> (now KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc42s42.500" target="_blank">42.500</a></cite>), is a fiduciary of the state government.<cite class="OAG">OAG 81-353</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The State Investment Commission has the authority under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc41s41.380ol12" target="_blank">41.380(2)</a></cite> (now KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc42s42.500" target="_blank">42.500</a></cite>) and subdivision (1)(l) of this section to invest “excess cash” in term repurchase agreements involving United States Treasury Bills since such agreements, in reality, involve the state’s purchase of United States Treasury Bills from a financial institution with an agreement that the financial institution will repurchase the treasury bills at some definite future date, not to exceed one year from date of investment.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-29</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since proposed “reverse repurchase agreements,” by which the state would sell an investment that it held (such as treasury bills) for a specified number of days with the condition that the state repurchase the security at the end of that time, contemplated the use of “excess” funds (in excess of that amount required to meet current state expenditures under normal payment schedules) within the time limits of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc41s41.380ol12" target="_blank">41.380(2)</a></cite> (now subsection (2) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc42s42.500" target="_blank">42.500</a></cite>), such agreements would be valid and permissible on the part of the State Investment Commission.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-209</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The authority to engage in “reverse repurchase agreements” is implicit in the express power of investment.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-209</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious purpose of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc41s41.380" target="_blank">41.380</a></cite> (now KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc42s42.500" target="_blank">42.500</a></cite>) and this section is to derive the maximum possible under marketing conditions from the investment of the state money.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-209</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the term “reverse repurchase agreement” is not found in that terminology in the statutes, the language of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc41s41.380" target="_blank">41.380</a></cite> (now KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc42s42.500" target="_blank">42.500</a></cite>) and subsection (1)(l) of this section is broad enough to cover this temporary sale of the securities, since the temporary sale does not negate the basic “investment” posture of the State Investment Commission in holding the securities involved in this procedure.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-209</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bank acting in its capacity as a trustee may invest the trust assets under management in a mutual fund registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so long as such investments are not prohibited by the trust instrument or court order and the investments would be regarded by a prudent businessman as a safe investment.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-227</cite>.

       This section has no application to the public funds governed by the specific statutes, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc66s66.480" target="_blank">66.480</a></cite>, subsection (2) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc386s386.030" target="_self">386.030</a></cite>, and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc386s386.050" target="_self">386.050</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 88-52</cite>.

      If a fiduciary makes a deposit in a bank or trust company to his personal credit of checks drawn by him upon an account in his own name as fiduciary, or of checks payable to him as fiduciary, or of checks drawn by him upon an account in the name of his principal if he is empowered to draw checks thereon, or of checks payable to his principal and endorsed by him if he is empowered to endorse them, or if he otherwise makes a deposit of funds held by him as fiduciary, the bank or trust company receiving the deposit is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing thereby a breach of his obligation as fiduciary. The bank or trust company may pay the amount of the deposit or any part thereof upon the personal check of the fiduciary without being liable to the principal, unless it receives the deposit or pays the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in making the deposit or in drawing the check or with knowledge of such facts that its action in receiving the deposit or paying the check amounts to bad faith.

        Plain language of the repeal of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc386s386.180" target="_self">386.180</a></cite> indicates that the Kentucky Legislature intended to remove any form of statutorily imposed guidelines regulating the fee habits of trustees of testamentary trusts, otherwise, the Legislature would have drafted and enacted a new law establishing how the fees should be calculated; therefore, in the absence of a statute directing otherwise, a court can only conclude that trustees of testamentary trusts are entitled to collect a “reasonable fee” commensurate with the performance of their duties. As a result, summary judgment was properly granted to several trustees in a compensation dispute where beneficiaries argued that the ceilings expressed in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc386s386.180" target="_self">386.180</a></cite> at the time the trusts were created remained in effect.

    A fiduciary may, after providing notice as required under paragraph (g) of this subsection, adjust between principal and income to the extent the fiduciary considers necessary, the terms of the trust or will describe the amount that may or shall be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust’s or estate’s income, and the fiduciary determines, after applying the rules in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc386s386.452ol11" target="_self">386.452(1)</a></cite>, that the fiduciary is unable to comply with KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc386s386.452ol12" target="_self">386.452(2)</a></cite>.

    That diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the fiduciary did not have the power to make the adjustment;
   </li><li class="p7" id="tXXXIIIc386s386.454ol11c12">
<span class="boldspan"></span>

   </li><li class="p7" id="tXXXIIIc386s386.454ol11c16">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes all or part of the trust or estate assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a fiduciary or appoint a fiduciary, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the fiduciary did not possess the power to make an adjustment;
   </li><li class="p7" id="tXXXIIIc386s386.454ol11c17">

<span class="boldspan"></span>

    If paragraph (c)5., 6., 7., or 8. of this subsection applies to a fiduciary and there is more than one (1) fiduciary or an additional fiduciary who is appointed by court order, a binding agreement, or otherwise as provided by law, a co-fiduciary to whom the provision does not apply may make an adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining fiduciary or fiduciaries is not permitted by the terms of the trust or will. If paragraph (c)5., 6., 7., or 8. of this subsection restricts all fiduciaries from possessing or exercising a power under this section, the fiduciary may petition the District Court for the court to effect the intended conversion or action.
   </li><li class="p7" id="tXXXIIIc386s386.454ol11e">
<span class="boldspan"></span>
    A fiduciary may release the entire power conferred by this subsection or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the fiduciary is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in paragraph (c)1. to 6. of this subsection or if the fiduciary determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust or estate of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in paragraph (c) of this subsection. The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual. Further, a fiduciary may divide a trust or estate into one (1) or more fractional shares if the division does not change the beneficial interests.

       (7/12/2012). In subsection (2)(a) of this statute, a reference to “paragraph (f)” has been changed to read “paragraph (g).” In subsection (3)(d) of this statute, a reference to “paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section” has been changed to read “subsection (2)(b) of this section.” These corrections are clearly required by the context and by examination of changes in paragraph designations that were adopted in successive drafts of 2012 Ky. Acts ch. 59, sec. 2. The Reviser of Statutes has corrected these manifest clerical or technical errors under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11" target="_blank">7.136(1)</a></cite>.

       (7/12/2006).
    2006 Ky. Acts ch. 247 instructs the Reviser of Statutes to adjust KRS references throughout the statutes to conform with the 2006 renumbering of the Financial Services Code, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc286" target="_blank">Chapter 286</a></cite>. Such an adjustment has been made in this statute.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
       (1/1/2005). In 2004 Ky. Acts ch. 158, sec. 3, subsec. (2), a reference is made to “subsection (1) of this Act.” Because it is clear from the subject matter of ch. 158, sec. 3, subsec. (1), that the reference was intended to be to “subsection (1) of this section” instead, this manifest clerical or typographical error has been corrected during codification by the Reviser of Statutes under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11" target="_blank">7.136(1)</a></cite>.

        Where a trustee did not collect the annual fee from principal for a period in excess of 33 years, it had exercised its option to collect the fee from principal upon termination of the trust.

        Where the administratrix failed to offer any proof of her claim for extraordinary services rendered to her father before his death, the trial court properly disallowed the claim. Rabold v.

There was conflicting evidence as to whether royalties had been underpaid, and the lessee had cured the alleged default by paying the disputed amount while the appeal was pending; moreover, an alleged mining permit violation could not serve as a basis to find the lessee in default absent an agency determination under KRS ch. 350 that such a violation existed.

        Circuit court properly permitted the transfer of the trusts to Delaware because the move to Delaware would provide a significant aggregate tax savings; the circuit court specifically found that the motions under consideration would accomplish the donor's intent to maximize the income to the beneficiaries. Beardmore v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 2017<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 60</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2017), review denied, ordered not published, 2018<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Circuit court made the requisite certification of jurisdiction to retain a trust administration case and decide it on the merits because the circuit court made sufficient findings on the record related to its certification of jurisdiction, and the record support its findings; a beneficiary was provided with, and took advantage of, the opportunity to argue the jurisdictional issue both orally at the hearing dates and in his court filings.

        Circuit court made the requisite certification of jurisdiction to retain a trust administration case and decide it on the merits because the circuit court made sufficient findings on the record related to its certification of jurisdiction, and the record support its findings; a beneficiary was provided with, and took advantage of, the opportunity to argue the jurisdictional issue both orally at the hearing dates and in his court filings.

        Legislature intended to provide trustees and beneficiaries the right to initiate a circuit court action relating to the same trust matter brought in district court if both courts have concurrent jurisdiction; the circuit court has jurisdiction over matters within the concurrent jurisdiction of the circuit court and district court.

        Appellee’s claims for breaches of trust and appropriate remedies, including trustee suspension, were provided for in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 386B, subch. 10 and jurisdiction over those claims was not granted exclusively to the district court, and thus those trust matters fell within the concurrent jurisdiction of the circuit court and the district court and were removable to the circuit court.

        Circuit court erred in dismissing siblings’ second action against the trustees of their parents’ trust. While the initial district court action arose from inappropriate messaging and distributions, many of the matters in the second action went far and beyond inappropriate messaging and distributions, and therefore the filing in circuit court was appropriate under the circumstances.

Ahlering, 123<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 713</cite>, 97 S.W. 344, 29<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1265</cite>, 1906<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 202</cite> (Ky. 1906).

        Where infant is not a nonresident owner of real estate, or the appointment of the guardian is not made by parents’ will, only county (now district) court of county where the infant resides has jurisdiction to appoint a guardian. Appointment of guardian by any other county court, and the acts of such guardian, are void (decision prior to 1942 amendment). South C. &amp; C. S. R. Co. v. Lee, 153<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 621</cite>, 156 S.W. 99, 1913<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 874</cite> (Ky. 1913).

        Where the guardian appointed by the county (now district) court appeared before the county judge and made oath that he was a resident of Kentucky while the record conclusively showed that he was, and had been, a nonresident, and that his ward, who owned land in the county, was also a nonresident, the order appointing the guardian was erroneous, but not void, since the county court had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter.

       A surrender of jurisdiction by the court exercising original jurisdiction over the appointment of a guardian should be effected by a proper court order reciting the circumstances under which the court surrenders jurisdiction to another court after which the court assuming jurisdiction can then enter an appropriate order recognizing the appointment.<cite class="OAG">OAG 72-565</cite>.

       This section would allow a court exercising original jurisdiction in the appointment of a guardian, in its sound discretion, to surrender jurisdiction to the court of the new residence of guardian and ward provided there is no conflict with the provisions of this section concerning exceptions to the jurisdiction conferred hereunder.<cite class="OAG">OAG 72-565</cite>.

        A mother of a handicapped child had failed to obtain legal authority to fund and manage a trust, which was funded by a settlement received from those allegedly responsible for the child’s condition, as she was not appointed by the District Court, did not obtain approval of the trust, failed to file settlements or accountings, and administered the trust with no court supervision and control; nevertheless, her ex-husband was not entitled to half of the trust funds upon the child’s death under the laws of descent and devise because his parental rights had been previously terminated.

        Where stepmother of infant children had given them every advantage in the way of care, education and devotion, and had supported them and built up a good home and business while their father was in prison, court properly appointed her as guardian, after death of children’s father, in preference to uncle of children, who failed to prove claim that stepmother was of unsuitable morals. The fact that stepmother was making a claim to certain property antagonistic to interests of children did not disqualify her, where the claim could not be established without proof by testimony other than her own.

        A paternal aunt and uncle could not be considered

        District Court’s ruling that it was in the best interests of a child that her maternal aunt and uncle rather than her paternal aunt and uncle be named as her co-guardians and co-conservators was supported by substantial evidence; while all of the parties loved the child and wanted to provide for her, the child was in need of a mother figure and the maternal aunt, who was the sister of the child’s mother, was the best choice particularly in light of the fact that the child’s father had murdered the child’s mother.

        Appointment of a guardian for an infant over 14 must be made in the precise manner set out in this section. Garth's Guardian v.

        A ward may, after arriving at the age of 14 years, supersede a former guardian appointed for him and nominate one of his own choosing; but unless the guardian selected by the infant meets the approval of the judge, the judge may require the infant to make other choices until he approves the infant’s choice, and after the infant has had one choice approved, he cannot supersede a guardian of his own choice by another, unless the guardian is removed for some other cause.

        This section does not make it mandatory upon the judge to appoint the guardian named by the infant, but merely directs that the infant may nominate his own guardian. Hunt v.

        The fact that judge, in appointing father of sixteen-year-old boy as boy’s guardian, acted upon a written request of the boy which was not signed in the presence of the judge, would at most make the appointment erroneous, and not void so as to be subject to collateral attack.

        Guardians must execute bonds in penal sums equal to the estimated value of the estates or funds that go into the hands of guardians. Rider's Ex'x v. Sherrard's Guardian, 231<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 112</cite>, 21 S.W.2d 147, 1929<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 229</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1929).

       <p>
        If a bond is not sufficient to protect from loss those who are interested, the judge must require the guardian to give a new bond. Rider's Ex'x v. Sherrard's Guardian, 231<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 112</cite>, 21 S.W.2d 147, 1929<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 229</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1929).

        An action may be maintained against the sureties before judgment is obtained against guardian. Nelms v. Vanmeter, 31 S.W. 874, 17<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 498</cite> (Ky. 1895).

        The surety on a bond required by this section may not be discharged where one property held by the guardian has been sold and the proceeds accounted for, without proof that the guardian has not received other property of the ward. Baker v. Maryland Casualty Co., 274 S.W.2d 784, 1954<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1241</cite> (Ky. 1954).

        Where bond is attested by the clerk and properly recorded, fact that order appointing guardian is not signed by judge until more than a month afterward does not release the sureties. Wills v. Evans, 38 S.W. 1090, 18<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1067</cite> (1897).

        Fact that one surety on the bond is released on a plea of infancy does not exonerate the other sureties. Wills v. Evans, 38 S.W. 1090, 18<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1067</cite> (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that court has failed to take proper steps to coerce guardian to file an inventory does not release guardian’s sureties. Mahan v. Steele, 109<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc31" target="_blank">Ky. 31</a></cite>, 58 S.W. 446, 22<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        Surety of guardian may obtain relief from bond by causing removal of guardian. Poynter v. Smith, 290<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 169</cite>, 160 S.W.2d 380, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 358</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        Guardian and his sureties are liable on his bond to the ward for every obligation resulting from acts which he is legally authorized to perform. Johnson v. Johnson's Heirs, 31<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc364" target="_blank">Ky. 364</a></cite>, 1833<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Sureties of guardian appointed in this state are liable on his bond for estate of the ward received by guardian in another state. McDonald v. Meadows, 58<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc507" target="_blank">Ky. 507</a></cite>, 1859<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 6</cite> (Ky. 1859) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where guardian is appointed for three wards and acts as guardian for all of them, but only two are named in his bond, sureties are not liable to the ward whose name does not appear in the bond. Greenly v. Daniels, 69<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc41" target="_blank">Ky. 41</a></cite>, 1869<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 95</cite> (Ky. 1869) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where successive bonds have been executed the burden is on the sureties, in an action against them, to show when guardian misappropriated the funds. Boyd v. Withers, 103<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 698</cite>, 46 S.W. 13, 20<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 511</cite>, 1898<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 115</cite> (Ky. 1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Execution of new bond is cumulative affording additional protection to ward. The liability of all sureties in all bonds is coequal in absence of stipulation to contrary in new bond, and one suit may be maintained against all sureties in same action. Abshire v. Rowe, 112<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 545</cite>, 66 S.W. 394, 23<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1854</cite>, 1902<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 196</cite> (Ky. 1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        At oral request of surety, guardian, in surety’s absence, procured a new bond with another surety. Court order on filing of second bond declared surety on first bond was relieved from further liability. Court’s action in permitting giving of second bond was merely equivalent to requiring new bond as additional security, and all sureties on both bonds were equally and jointly liable. Barker v. Boyd, 71 S.W. 528, 24<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1389</cite> (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Surety on guardian’s bond is not liable for money collected by guardian pursuant to void sale of ward’s land, because the money is not received in his capacity as guardian. Rudy v. Rudy, 145<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 245</cite>, 140 S.W. 192, 1911<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 827</cite> (Ky. 1911).

        The judge is not an insurer of the solvency of the sureties, and if, after hearing such evidence as would satisfy a person of ordinary judgment that the sureties are solvent, he accepts them, he will not be liable.

        Judge’s merely being satisfied with sufficiency of surety will not exonerate him from liability to the ward for failing to require sufficient surety; he is liable if he accepts insufficient surety without exercising ordinary care to acquaint himself with the solvency of the surety.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where guardian failed to file inventory within the required period, failed to settle accounts for five years, was extravagant and wasteful in managing the ward’s estate, removal of guardian was justified. Clay's Guardian v. Clay, 89 S.W. 500, 28<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 398</cite> (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion to remove a guardian may be made at the instance of the ward, or another having the right to represent him, or upon the court’s own motion. Clay's Guardian v. Clay, 89 S.W. 500, 28<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 398</cite> (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a guardian has been duly appointed and has qualified by taking the oath and executing the bond as required by law, he may not at the mere caprice or whim of the court or some complaining party be removed, but only can be removed for some cause or causes enumerated by statute or recognized by law.

        Because a ward’s prior guardian retained a lawyer to represent the ward in a tort action, the lawyer’s professional duties extended to the ward, and an attorney-client relationship existed between the lawyer and the ward; thus, a substitute guardian had standing to bring a legal malpractice action against the lawyer based on his representation of the ward in the tort action.

        Guardian has the authority to enter into collateral agreements which may affect the jural rights of her ward, and a guardian’s decision to execute an optional arbitration agreement must be in the ward’s best interest. Therefore, arbitration could have been compelled in a negligence and personal injury case because a guardian had the authority to execute an optional arbitration agreement on behalf of her ward for admission to a long-term care facility.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Resident guardians and conservators shall not remove out of this Commonwealth any of the property of their wards without first obtaining the approval of a District Court of the county in which the guardian or conservator was qualified. The District Court, upon the petition sworn to by the guardian or conservator and such proof as may be deemed necessary, may authorize the removal of the property of the ward out of this Commonwealth, upon terms and conditions that are equitable and just and will secure and protect the rights and interests of the ward. Guardians and conservators may be restrained from the unlawful removal of property of their wards out of this Commonwealth upon the petition of the ward by next friend, or upon the petition of any surety on the bond of the guardian or conservator.

        Where the same person is administrator and guardian, after a sufficient time has elapsed to settle up the estate, he will be deemed to hold the fund as guardian and charged with interest as such.

        When no balance is owing by the guardian at the end of any year he should not be charged interest in biennial rests. Campbell v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where part of a ward’s estate consisted of notes bearing 8 percent interest the guardian was chargeable with this rate of interest where he failed to show any account books and failed to disclose the amount of interest actually received. Hedges v. Hedges, 73 S.W. 1112, 24<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 2220</cite> (1903).

        It is not neglect to keep a sum on hand sufficient to meet contingent expenses, or a sum so small that a prudent person would not seek investment, or if by reasonable diligence remunerative investment cannot be found.

        Where there was no evidence public administrator and guardian used ward’s money himself or could have found a safe income yielding investment thereof, he was not chargeable with interest until the end of a year from the time of his appointment.

        Committee may not invest ward’s funds in notes which make it impossible to compound the interest every two years, unless no other safe investment can be made at the time, and where he makes such investment he is liable for such additional interest on the amount of the notes as he could have obtained by collecting and reinvesting interest from time to time.

        Where committee charges ward a commission in excess of what he is entitled to, he is liable not only for the excess but for interest from the end of the year in which excess arose and thereafter for interest upon interest in biennial rests.

     Handling amount of not more than $10,000 due to minor or person under disability.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When a minor or other person under disability, having no guardian or conservator, is entitled to receive a sum not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), exclusive of interest, in any action in which real estate has been sold or in the settlement of any estate or from any other source, the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability may settle or compromise the dollar amount when in the interest of the minor or other person under disability. The court in which the action is pending, or, if the sum does not derive from the action, the District Court, may order the sum to be paid to the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability. Before entering the order, the court shall approve any settlement or compromise and shall be satisfied by affidavit or oral testimony that the minor or other person under disability is in the custody of the person to whom it is proposed to pay the money and the latter, upon withdrawal of the money, shall be under obligation as trustee to expend it, for the support, maintenance, or education of the minor or other person under disability. When the order is made, no bond shall be required of the person having custody of the minor or other person under disability and the purchaser of the real property may pay the share of the minor or other person under disability into court, and no lien shall remain on the property therefor and the money may be withdrawn by the person mentioned in the order without that person giving bond. A release executed by the person to whom the court has ordered the sum paid shall have the same effect as a release by a duly appointed guardian.

       No appointment of a guardian ad litem shall be made until the defendant is summoned, or until a person is summoned for him, as is authorized by law; nor until an affidavit of the plaintiff, or of his attorney, be filed in court, or with the clerk, showing that the defendant has no guardian, curator, nor conservator, residing in this state, known to the affiant.

       <span class="boldspan">
       </span>
       A guardian ad litem must be a regular, practicing attorney of the court and may be appointed by the court, whether a guardian, curator, or conservator appear for the defendant or not. The guardian ad litem may be appointed upon the motion of the plaintiff or of any friend of the defendant; but neither the plaintiff nor his attorney shall be appointed, nor be permitted to suggest the name of the proposed guardian ad litem; and the court may change the guardian so appointed whenever the interest of the infant may appear to require such change.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387s387.305ol13">
       <span class="boldspan">
       </span>
       It shall be the duty of the guardian ad litem to attend properly to the preparation of the case; and in an ordinary action he may cause as many witnesses to be subpoenaed as he may think proper, subject to the control of the court; and in an equitable action he may take depositions, not, however, exceeding three (3), without leave of the court.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXXIIIc387s387.305ol14">
       <span class="boldspan">
       </span>
       The court shall allow to the guardian ad litem a reasonable fee for his services, to be paid by the plaintiff and taxed in the costs. The affidavit of such guardian, or of another person, or other competent evidence, is admissible to prove the services rendered, but not to prove their value. The court must decide concerning such value, without reference to the opinions of parties or other witnesses.
      </li>

       <span class="boldspan">

       Whether appointed pursuant to this statute or pursuant to a provision of the Kentucky Unified Juvenile Code, the duties of a guardian ad litem shall be to advocate for the client’s best interest in the proceeding through which the guardian ad litem was appointed. Without an appointment, the guardian ad litem shall have no obligation to initiate action or to defend the client in other proceedings.

        This section, relating to the officer who may appoint a guardian ad litem for defense of an action is entirely procedural and as it conflicts with the Civil Rules, the conflict should be resolved in favor of the Civil Rules. Stanfield v. Willoughby, 269 S.W.2d 270, 1954<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 992</cite> (Ky. 1954).

        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The appointment of a guardian ad litem is a matter within the discretion of the court where the guardian’s interest may be adverse to the ward’s. Adams v. De Dominguez, 129<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 599</cite>, 112 S.W. 663, 1908<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 199</cite> (Ky. 1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        A guardian ad litem is both a fiduciary and a lawyer of the infant and, in a special sense, the representative of the court to protect the minor. Black v. Wiedeman, 254 S.W.2d 344, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1132</cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        A guardian ad litem who was appointed to receive service of process has no authority to defend the infant in an adoption action. Stanfield v. Willoughby, 269 S.W.2d 270, 1954<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 992</cite> (Ky. 1954).

        “The filing of the affidavit is not a mandatory requirement or a jurisdictional fact, it is merely directory and while it is better practice to file the affidavit in all cases where the appointment of a guardian ad litem is asked, the failure to file it will not be cause for reversal, unless it appears that the interest of the infant has been prejudiced.” Goosling v. Varney's Trustee, 268<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.34.html#tXXXIVc394" target="_blank">Ky. 394</a></cite>, 105 S.W.2d 178, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Where warning order attorney was appointed to represent the interest of a nonresident infant worth $7,257.07, notified the infant of the pendency and nature of the action, studied the question with the help of the opposing attorney, filed his report, and participated in a hearing lasting approximately 45 minutes, the award of $1,500 as his fee was excessive and should be reduced to $500. Kreiger v. Kreiger, 314<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 375</cite>, 233 S.W.2d 982, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 986</cite> (Ky. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        In fixing a fee for a guardian ad litem, the character of the litigation; the rights in controversy; the nature, duration and extent of the services; the responsibility, industry, diligence and accomplishment of the guardian; the general methods of evaluating attorneys’ fees; and an allowance for services, if any, in the Court of Appeals should be considered. Black v. Wiedeman, 254 S.W.2d 344, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1132</cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a guardian ad litem has appeared before the court of appeals in the litigation in question, that court may take into account its own knowledge of the circumstances in reviewing the allowance of a fee for the guardian and it is not bound by the findings of the circuit court. Black v. Wiedeman, 254 S.W.2d 344, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1132</cite> (Ky. 1952).

        Where guardian ad litem, in action for sale and division, answered and stated it was to the best interests of the minor remaindermen that the property be sold, any remaindermen thereafter born would be bound by the judgment through the doctrine of virtual representation.

        The duties of a guardian ad litem appointed in an incompetency proceeding in District Court do not include the bringing of a declaratory judgment lawsuit in Circuit Court on behalf of the ward. Any such action must be brought by a next friend. Sparks v. Boggs, 839 S.W.2d 581, 1992<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 229</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1992).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The mere appointment of a guardian ad litem and the filing of an answer by him where the infant is under 14 years of age does not bring the infant before the court. Walker v. Perkins, 256<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc442" target="_blank">Ky. 442</a></cite>, 76 S.W.2d 251, 1934<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 423</cite> (Ky. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        If jurisdiction is not acquired over a person under disability as prescribed by statute, he is not affected by the judgment. Proctor v. Mitchell, 302<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.15.html#tXVc179" target="_blank">Ky. 179</a></cite>, 194 S.W.2d 177, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 628</cite> (Ky. 1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the incompetent was not served with process before the appointment of the guardian ad litem as required by this section, the answer of the guardian ad litem does not prevent the judgment from being void as to the incompetent. Proctor v. Mitchell, 302<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.15.html#tXVc179" target="_blank">Ky. 179</a></cite>, 194 S.W.2d 177, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       “It was the intent of Senate Bill 35 that guardianship and conservatorship for disabled persons be established only when necessary and if partial guardianship or conservatorship was appropriate, it was preferable.

       <p>
        The purpose of this section is to appoint a person to take care of the day-to-day personal business of an incompetent. The scope of authority, duties and accountability of a guardian is much broader than that of a traditional power of attorney, even one intended to survive disability. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 22</cite> (Ky. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The sections dealing with guardianship for disabled persons are remedial rather than exclusive in nature, where the intent was to provide services for incompetent persons not only as specifically articulated but also as reasonably inferable from the nature of the powers of a guardian. DeGrella v. Elston, 858 S.W.2d 698, 1993<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 103</cite> (Ky. 1993).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (4) of this section merely advises the trial court of the legislative intent to impose the least restrictive measures under the individual’s circumstances. The trial judge is not granted authority by this section to forego a hearing as set forth in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc387s387.570" target="_self">387.570</a></cite>, because he is of the opinion that the respondent is being adequately taken care of by other means.

       <p>
        Due process protections which are a part of the formal guardianship hearing do not vitiate the need for a hearing at the time of commitment. Doe v. Austin, 848 F.2d 1386, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8334 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 967, 109 S. Ct. 495, 102 L. Ed. 2d 531, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5327 (U.S. 1988).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A guardian is answerable to a court and must file accountings at least annually; the attorney-in-fact is answerable and accountable only to the principal who may be mentally disabled. It is obvious that there must be adequate safeguards and control on the person who manages an incompetent’s estate and that a great disparity exists between the durable power of attorney and a guardian. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 22</cite> (Ky. 1989).

         5. Durable Power of Attorney.
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The durable power of attorney is not a substitute for the appointment of a guardian. The existence of a durable power of attorney cannot prevent the institution of guardianship proceedings. The disabled person is entitled to have the district court exercise control and supervision of her estate by the impaneling of a jury to determine whether she is disabled pursuant to chapter 387 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes and if so to appoint a guardian in accordance with that chapter, and if a fiduciary is appointed then the power of attorney-in-fact shall terminate and an account must be given to the court-appointed fiduciary. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 22</cite> (Ky. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The durable power of attorney provided by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc386s386.093" target="_self">386.093</a></cite> does not make the appointment of a guardian automatically unnecessary. It was not intended to supplant the provisions of this section. Rice v. Floyd, 768 S.W.2d 57, 1989<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 22</cite> (Ky. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a wrongful death case against a nursing home, an arbitration agreement was not valid because parents could not enter a contract on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no actual authority on the part of the parents to enter into a contract on behalf of the daughter, a signatory was not a guardian of the disabled adult, and the parents could not appoint the signatory as a power of attorney; even though the parents had the right to make health care decisions under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc311s311.631ol11" target="_blank">311.631(1)</a></cite>, entering into an arbitration agreement was not a health care decision. Because the parents were unable to name an attorney-in-fact on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no apparent authority either. GGNSC Stanford, LLC v. Rowe, 388 S.W.3d 117, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 177</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).

       By the repeal of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc203" target="_blank">Chapter 203</a></cite>, the General Assembly intended to place the filing of disability judgments and the indexing of same as a responsibility of the circuit clerk, instead of the county clerk. Thus on and after July 1, 1982, there is no statutory basis for filing disability judgments and indexing them in the county clerk’s office.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-486</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of subsection (8) of this section is that the judgment of disability or partial disability must be filed in the District Court. Thus the Circuit Court-District Court clerk must see to it that such judgments are filed in the clerk’s office; and the circuit clerk must establish, on and after July 1, 1982, an index system covering such judgments collected in a book identifiable as involving notices of actions and encumbrances.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-486</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (8) of this section when read as a whole, requires that a certified copy of the judgment of disability must be filed in the county clerk’s office for unless this is done, notice to any subsequent bona fide purchaser for value, mortgagee, or encumbrancer will not be afforded.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-308</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning the county clerk’s fee for filing and indexing a certified copy of a disability judgment under subsection (8) of this section, the proper fee for the county clerks to accompany such filing and indexing is five dollars for filing miscellaneous documents for which no specific fee is set, where the record does not exceed three pages; where such document exceeds three pages, for each additional page the clerk’s fee is one dollar and fifty cents.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-322</cite>.

For purposes of this subsection, the interdisciplinary evaluation report may be one performed within two (2) months prior to the placement for purposes of determining whether such placement is necessary and appropriate, or may be an evaluation and assessment provided by the residential facility immediately after placement. Notice to the court shall not be required where the ward is transferred from one licensed residential facility to another;

        The sections dealing with guardianship for disabled persons are remedial rather than exclusive in nature, where the intent was to provide services for incompetent persons not only as specifically articulated but also as reasonably inferable from the nature of the powers of a guardian. DeGrella v. Elston, 858 S.W.2d 698, 1993<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 103</cite> (Ky. 1993).

        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The right to withdrawal of medical treatment for a person in a persistent vegetative state exists within the framework of the individual’s common law rights of self-determination and informed consent in obtaining medical treatment, and these rights can be exercised by an incompetent person through the process of surrogate decision-making so long as the wishes of the patient were known.

       <p>
        In a wrongful death case against a nursing home, an arbitration agreement was not valid because parents could not enter a contract on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no actual authority on the part of the parents to enter into a contract on behalf of the daughter, a signatory was not a guardian of the disabled adult, and the parents could not appoint the signatory as a power of attorney; even though the parents had the right to make health care decisions under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.26.html#tXXVIc311s311.631ol11" target="_blank">311.631(1)</a></cite>, entering into an arbitration agreement was not a health care decision. Because the parents were unable to name an attorney-in-fact on behalf of their disabled daughter, there was no apparent authority either. GGNSC Stanford, LLC v. Rowe, 388 S.W.3d 117, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 177</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Guardian has the authority to enter into collateral agreements which may affect the jural rights of her ward, and a guardian’s decision to execute an optional arbitration agreement must be in the ward’s best interest. Therefore, arbitration could have been compelled in a negligence and personal injury case because a guardian had the authority to execute an optional arbitration agreement on behalf of her ward for admission to a long-term care facility. LP Pikeville, LLC v. Wright, 2014<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 57</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 4, 2014).

       (7/12/2012). In subsection (4) of this statute, the Reviser of Statutes has inserted the phrase “KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc387s387.855" target="_self">387.855</a></cite> to
   <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXXIIIc387s387.910" target="_self">387.910”</a></cite> in place of a reference to a single statute. In subsection (4) of
    2012 Ky. Acts ch. 59, sec. 9, the term “the court” is defined “for the purposes of Section 8 of this Act,” but the term does not appear in Section 8, and it is clear from the context that the definition is intended to apply to the entire range of statutes. This manifest clerical or typographical error has been corrected under
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11" target="_blank">7.136(1)</a></cite>.

      Notwithstanding the provisions of existing law for adjudication of mental disability and appointment of a guardian or conservator upon the inquest of a jury, where a petition is filed for the appointment of a guardian or conservator for a mentally disabled beneficiary of the Veterans Affairs under the provisions of this chapter, who is found within this state, whether or not a resident thereof, a certificate of the administrator of Veterans Affairs or his duly authorized representative, accompanying such petition setting forth the fact that such beneficiary has been rated incompetent by the Veterans Affairs on examination in accordance with the laws and regulations governing such Veterans Affairs, and that the appointment of a guardian or conservator is a condition precedent to the payment of any moneys due each beneficiary by the Veterans Affairs, shall be prima facie evidence of the necessity for such appointment. Provided, however, that some member of the bar shall be appointed by the court to represent and protect the interests and rights of such mentally disabled beneficiary as provided under existing law, and further that the right of any such mentally disabled beneficiary or any person interested in such beneficiary to demand a trial by jury shall not be denied.

       Whenever in a proceeding for the trial and commitment of any person who appears to be mentally disabled it is determined that such person is either an individual with an intellectual disability, an epileptic, or a mentally ill person and ought to be committed for safekeeping or treatment and it appears that such person is eligible for care or treatment by the Veterans Affairs or other agency of the United States government, the court of the county in which such person is found, having jurisdiction in such matters, upon receipt of a certificate from the Veterans Affairs or such other agency showing that facilities are available and that such person is eligible for care or treatment therein, may commit such person to the Veterans Affairs or other agency of the United States government for care or treatment. Thereafter, such person, upon admission to any such facility, shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the Veterans Affairs or other agency of the United States government. The chief officer of any such facility or institution to which such person is committed under the provisions of this section shall be vested with the same powers as are exercised by superintendents of state hospitals for mental diseases within this state with respect to the retention, transfer, parole or discharge of the person so committed. Notice of such pending commitment proceedings shall be furnished the person whose commitment is sought and his right to appear and defend shall not be denied. The judgment or order of commitment by a court of competent jurisdiction of another state committing a person to the Veterans Affairs or other agency of the United States government, for care or treatment, shall have the same force and effect as to such person while in this state as in the state in which is situated the court entering such judgment or making such order.

       Upon receipt of a certificate of the Veterans Affairs or such other agency of the United States government that facilities are available for the care or treatment of any person heretofore committed to any hospital for the mentally ill or other institution in this state for the care of persons similarly disabled and that such person is eligible for such care or treatment, the superintendent of any such hospital or institution in this state is hereby authorized to cause the transfer of any such person to the Veterans Affairs or other agency of the United States government for care or treatment. Upon effecting any such transfer, the committing court shall be notified thereof by the transferring agency; provided, however, that no person shall be transferred if he be confined pursuant to conviction of any crime or misdemeanor, or if he shall have been acquitted of any such charge solely on the ground of insanity, unless prior to such transfer the court originally committing such person shall enter an order for such transfer after appropriate motion and hearing.

        Where guardian ad litem, in action for sale and division, answered and stated it was to the best interests of the minor remaindermen that the property be sold, any remaindermen thereafter born would be bound by the judgment through the doctrine of virtual representation.

        The action of a court in approving a lease of a contingent infant remainderman’s interest is, under doctrine of virtual representations, binding upon afterborn remaindermen.

       <p>
        In action to sell infant’s land for support and maintenance, the failure to file the title papers under which the property of the infant was held did not make the judgment void; it was erroneous only, and the error could not be taken advantage of collaterally in another suit. National Surety Co. v. Rives' Guardian, 164<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc201" target="_blank">Ky. 201</a></cite>, 175 S.W. 351, 1915<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 355</cite> (Ky. 1915) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        A judgment confirming a decretal judicial sale of the vested real property of an infant would not be reversed upon appeal for the single reason that the judgment under which the sale was made was erroneous and was reversed after the sale was made and confirmed and deed made to purchaser, where the court which rendered the judgment decreeing the sale had competent jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter of the action, and the sale was regularly and fairly made, to a bona fide purchaser. Webb v. Webb's Guardian, 178<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.12.html#tXIIc152" target="_blank">Ky. 152</a></cite>, 198 S.W. 736, 1917<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 706</cite> (Ky. 1917) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where in sale of infants’ land no bond was executed, the judgment was void. Alexander v. Tipton, 218<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 666</cite>, 291 S.W. 1019, 1927<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 207</cite> (Ky. 1927) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bona fide purchaser of land of infant, the sale of which was later declared void, who placed lasting and valuable improvements on it under the good-faith belief that he owns its perfect title, may, as against the true owner, have a lien on it, not for their cost, but to the extent that they have enhanced its vendible value, not to exceed their cost. Hurt's Guardian v. Crawford Coal Corp., 222<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc504" target="_blank">Ky. 504</a></cite>, 1 S.W.2d 955, 1927<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 954</cite> (Ky. 1927) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        A judgment selling the land of infants is void only if the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject or the parties, all of whom must be treated as being of full legal capacity, and, accordingly, mere irregularities and even prejudicial errors of reversible magnitude cannot overthrow a judgment on the ground of voidness, provided the rendering court had jurisdiction of the suit’s subject and parties. Hudson v. Hightower, 307<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc295" target="_blank">Ky. 295</a></cite>, 210 S.W.2d 933, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 723</cite> (Ky. 1948) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to deliver summons to mother on behalf of her minor children did not make an uncontested judgment for sale of real estate of these children void where the mother received a copy of the summons in her own behalf, the person actually having charge of the children received copies of the summons in their behalf, and a guardian ad litem represented the children and duly made his report. Hudson v. Hightower, 307<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.25.html#tXXVc295" target="_blank">Ky. 295</a></cite>, 210 S.W.2d 933, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 723</cite> (Ky. 1948) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        An untrue affidavit for appointment of a warning order attorney for an infant owner of real property who was not a nonresident but was merely absent in military service does not make an uncontested judgment for the sale of such real estate void, but merely voidable, and where the judgment is not appealed within 90 days of the infant’s discharge from military service such defect is waived.

        Purchase by parents at decretal sale, without court permission, of property, all of which they owned except small contingent fractional interests held by their children, was not antagonistic to the children’s interests and, in any event, could not render void the judgment or the transfer of the title by judicial deed.

     Limitation on power of fiduciary to sell or mortgage property — Circuit clerk may alter.
      </span>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the event the power of a fiduciary to sell or mortgage any real estate is expressly limited by the will or trust instrument under which he is acting, such limitation may only be altered or amended by the Circuit Court of the county wherein the fiduciary was appointed, or if the fiduciary is acting under an agreement of trust without court supervision, the county in which the trust is or could be registered, in an action brought by the fiduciary in which all persons having a present or contingent interest in the property interest sought to be sold or mortgaged or its proceeds are made parties. Before adjudging that the fiduciary may deviate from the terms of the will or trust the court shall determine that there exist circumstances apparently unknown to the testator or settlor; that such circumstances would substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes intended; and that deviation is in the best interests of all parties concerned.

       When two (2) or more persons other than tenants by the entirety in residential property actually occupied by them as a principal residence share title to real estate in such manner that a conveyance by them jointly would pass a fee simple title, any one (1) or more of them may bring an action for the sale or division thereof in the Circuit Court of the county in which the land, or the greater part thereof, lies, making parties defendant those owners who have not joined as plaintiffs. A fiduciary possessing a power of sale may institute such an action against owners of interests not represented by him. Defendant owners shall be brought before the court in the manner provided by the civil rules whether or not a fiduciary possesses a power of sale of the defendant’s interest, but any fiduciary possessing such a power shall also be made a defendant. The case shall be tried without a jury.

       A defendant who is under disability and for whom no fiduciary is acting shall be represented in the action by a guardian ad litem, but in the event of sale of such defendant’s interest the court shall retain control of the proceeds of such interest until a duly appointed and adequately bonded fiduciary or custodian pursuant to a court order makes claim to the funds.

    In all such actions indivisibility of the real estate shall be presumed unless an issue in respect thereto is raised by the pleading of any party, and if the court is satisfied from the evidence that the property is divisible, without materially impairing the value of any interest therein, division thereof pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc381s381.135" target="_blank">381.135</a></cite> shall be ordered.

       If a sale of all or any part of the real estate shall be ordered, the court shall refer the matter to the master commissioner or appoint a commissioner to conduct a public sale and convey the property upon terms of sale and disposition of the net proceeds as may have been determined by the court.

       <span class="boldspan">

       The death of any party pending the action and prior to distribution of the proceeds of sale or setting apart a divisible share shall not affect the action but the court may direct distribution or apportionment to the successors in interest of the decedent upon application therefor.

       If the interest of any party be one for life, or other term, in any portion of the real estate, the court shall determine the value of such interest and direct that such party receive a portion of the net sale proceeds or portion of the property if divisible, in fee in satisfaction of such interest, but if any party to the action objects to such procedure, and if the court finds that such procedure would defeat the objects and purpose of a person not a party to the action, such as a testator, grantor or settlor, but that sale or division is nevertheless desirable, the court shall order that the interest of the life or term tenant shall continue as to his portion of the real estate or the net proceeds of the sale thereof, in the latter case by directing that the funds derived from the sale of that portion of the real estate in which the life or term interest existed be paid to a trustee, appointed by and accountable to the District Court, for reinvestment and distribution of income and principal in a manner consistent with the instrument under which the life or term estate was created.

        Where actions of wife in seeking to partition the real property left to her and to the couple’s children in husband’s will would defeat the purpose of bequest, and where children object to such a partitioning, the right to partition may potentially be stopped under this section. McKinney v. McKinney, 888 S.W.2d 332, 1994<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 124</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).

        Since, with the exception of an erroneously admitted deposition, all of the evidence supported partition of a property between three siblings, where one brother stated the farm could be divided and that his preferred section was the portion where the farmhouse, barn, and sheds were located, which was agreed to by his sister, the trial court erred in finding that the farm could not be divided without materially impairing its value.

        Where the sale or partitioning of real estate is merely incidental, and not primary, in an action for divorce, the court is precluded from awarding an attorney’s fee to be taxed as a part of the costs and paid out of the proceeds from the sale of the property as would occur in a partition suit pursuant to this section; rather, the remedy would be recovery from the husband pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403s403.220" target="_blank">403.220</a></cite>.

        Where testator devised his farm to his widow and three children, devising his widow a possessory freehold estate, a life estate on executory limitation, and devising his children a vested remainder in fee simple with a shifting executory interest in his widow’s life estate, his widow was not necessarily prevented from selling the farm without children’s agreement but, under this section, was required to join all parties to the fee simple absolute and partition the real property or proceeds of any sale of the real property according to each parties’ interest. McKinney v. McKinney, 888 S.W.2d 332, 1994<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 124</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1994).

        Where children/remaindermen objected to the sale of real property left to them and their mother under father’s will, children had a right to seek equitable distribution of funds or an order directing funds be paid to a trustee and invested with the income payable for life to their mother, the life tenant, where partitioning of real property on mother’s request was ordered by the court under this section.

        Because the language of subsection (3) of this section does not explicitly shift the risk of nonpersuasion to the opponent of the evidence, the presumption language in subsection is governed by KRE 301. Roberts v. Roberts, 67 S.W.3d 605, 2001<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 47</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to rebut the presumption of indivisibility, it is not sufficient to raise an issue as to indivisibility; it is also necessary to present evidence that the property at issue is divisible. Roberts v. Roberts, 67 S.W.3d 605, 2001<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 47</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2001).

       <p>
        Trustee was not entitled to sell as a whole property owned jointly by the debtor and his niece as tenants in common because the trustee had not satisfied his burden to prove that partition was impracticable, and the valuation testimony was unsatisfactory; the presumption of indivisibility pursuant to state law also did not satisfy the requirement that partition was impracticable.

        Before a sale of real estate in which infants have a joint interest can be ordered by the court the fact of indivisibility must affirmatively appear. Shaws' Guardian, Louisville Trust Co. v. Grimes, 187<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.21.html#tXXIc250" target="_blank">Ky. 250</a></cite>, 218 S.W. 447, 1919<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 388</cite> (Ky. Ct.

       </p>
       <p>
        Equality of value, as well as of quantity and quality, is a criterion in determining whether land jointly owned should be partitioned in kind or sold and proceeds divided so that the relative vendible value assigned to each party shall be proportioned as near as may be to the extent of his interest. Whitefort v. Barron, 291<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 712</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 545, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 314</cite> (Ky. 1942) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory provisions are clear and explicit in permitting a sale of jointly-owned land for a division of the proceeds if sought on the ground of indivisibility only if it is in fact equitably indivisible, the factor of values being an important consideration. Whitefort v. Barron, 291<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 712</cite>, 165 S.W.2d 545, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 314</cite> (Ky. 1942) (decided under prior law).

        In determining whether a tract of land should be partitioned between joint owners, the increase of value of an adjoining tract owned by plaintiffs would not be considered. Conyers v.

        Where, following wife’s death, husband brought action against wife’s heirs, asking for sale of real estate subject to his curtesy interest, in which action all heirs were properly served, but husband later filed an amended petition asking that the real estate be sold free of his curtesy right and that he be paid the value of his curtesy right in cash, and no service was made on the amended petition, judgment fixing value of husband’s curtesy interest at a percentage of the sale price and ordering the real estate to be sold was entirely void, because of the failure to make service, and it was error for the court to set aside the judgment only to the extent it ordered a sale of the land.

        It is beyond the power of the court to approve an offer; rather the function of the court is to approve a sale pursuant to a binding offer, not to try to breathe life into a dead offer, and a judgment approving a sale “in accordance with the terms and conditions of said contract” when there was no contract was obviously a nullity.

        In an action brought for the purpose of dividing land partly owned by an infant or for its sale or division, it was not necessary for the infant owner or owners to be made defendants and duly summoned and defense made for them in the cause, but the action could be maintained in the name of the infant as plaintiff by his statutory guardian or by such guardian alone.

        An action for the sale of indivisible property and distribution of the proceeds among the joint owners is one in which infants may be joined as plaintiffs by their guardians and in this character of action the infants need not be made defendants. Hume v. Chenault, 305<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68" target="_blank">Ky. 68</a></cite>, 202 S.W.2d 1018, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 769</cite> (Ky. 1947) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action where infant was a proper party plaintiff through his statutory guardian, the infant through the guardian had the right to allege such facts as entitled him to the relief sought, and when such facts were set out in the petition and were not controverted, they could be taken by the court as true just as if the pleader had been an adult and his allegations were undenied. Hume v. Chenault, 305<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68" target="_blank">Ky. 68</a></cite>, 202 S.W.2d 1018, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        It is not indispensable that infant defendant be served with summons, but the appearance and answer of his guardian is all that is required or intended by the legislature. Shelby v. Harrison, 84<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc144" target="_blank">Ky. 144</a></cite>, 8<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 83</cite>, 1886<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 47</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1886) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by a guardian for sale or division of property, it is not necessary that the ward should be a party; therefore, where he is made a defendant, it is not necessary that he should be served with process. Howard v. Singleton, 94<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc336" target="_blank">Ky. 336</a></cite>, 22 S.W. 337, 15<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 309</cite>, 1893<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 57</cite> (Ky. 1893) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        A guardian may bring an action for his infant ward and obtain an order of court for a sale of joint property, without making the infant ward a plaintiff or defendant. Scott v. Graves, 153<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc221" target="_blank">Ky. 221</a></cite>, 154 S.W. 1084, 1913<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 803</cite> (Ky. 1913) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding to sell land for the purpose of division among the joint owners, some of whom were infants and were made defendants, an appearance by the statutory guardian who filed an answer in their behalf was sufficient to bring the infants before the court. Pollard v. Hamilton, 179<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 284</cite>, 200 S.W. 621, 1918<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 220</cite> (Ky. 1918) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to sell a vested estate in real property jointly owned by two or more persons, if the estate in the possession or property cannot be divided without materially impairing its value, the guardian of an infant may join with the adult owners in his own name without making the infant either a party plaintiff or defendant. Smith v. Smith, 255<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 191</cite>, 72 S.W.2d 425, 1934<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 168</cite> (Ky. 1934) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        An infant’s guardian may bring a suit, or join in a suit, to sell lands without his ward being made either a party plaintiff or a defendant in the proceeding. Kidd v. Kidd, 276<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.23.html#tXXIIIc271" target="_blank">Ky. 271</a></cite>, 124 S.W.2d 66, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

      When two (2) or more persons share title to real estate but an interest therein may be possessed by persons unborn or not immediately ascertainable, an action for sale or division may be brought in the same manner as provided in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.33.html#tXXXIIIc389As389A.030" target="_blank">389A.030</a></cite> but the interest of the unborn or unascertainable persons, unless a living member of the class to which such persons belong who is sui juris is a party to the action, shall be represented by a guardian ad litem who is not acting in such capacity for any other party to the action.
