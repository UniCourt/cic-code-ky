        Because a small winery is defined in KRS 241.010(45) (now 241.010(53)) as one which makes its wine from Kentucky fruit, juices or honey, an Indiana winery did not have to apply for a small winery license in Kentucky before challenging the constitutionality of Kentucky’s laws banning the direct sale of out-of-state wine to Kentucky customers; it appeared that the Indiana winery would not meet the definition of “small winery” in § 241.010(45).

        Where the statute not only gives the alcoholic beverage control board authority to stop the sale of whiskey on the premises, but also confers upon it authority to prevent the premises from being used for any purpose, it amounts, in effect, to the taking of private property, which cannot be done even by the state without due process of law.

Although it has broad discretion in the administration of alcoholic beverage control, and has authority to adopt reasonable regulations, the rules it promulgated must conform to some standard and must have some stability of operation.

        Where a resolution limiting by regulation the number of licenses of each kind or class for the county was not approved by the state alcoholic beverage control board, an attempted limitation on the local alcoholic beverage licenses by the county fiscal court was without authority and was invalid.

        An urban-county ordinance requiring a $.05 refund on all beverage containers would not be preempted by statutes or regulations of the department of alcoholic beverage control since there is nothing in the language of this section to indicate that restrictions of some sort cannot be applied to beverage containers, especially where the regulation has nothing to do with the alcoholic nature of the beverage and since the alcoholic beverage control board has jurisdiction over only a segment of the types of beverages, i.e., alcoholic beverages, included in such a proposed bottle bill.

        The county judge/executive has no authority to act as the local alcoholic beverage control administrator if the fiscal court has failed to pass a resolution declaring that regulation of traffic in alcoholic beverages is necessary, since a resolution of this type is a condition precedent to the assumption of authority as alcoholic beverage control administrator by the county judge/executive.

       The phrase “qualified voter” as used in this section means a voter who is constitutionally qualified and properly registered, so that a person who signs a local option petition must be 18 years of age, a resident of the state for one year, of the county for six months, and of the precinct for 60 days as prescribed by Ky Const., § 145, and be a duly registered voter, but need not have voted in the last election.

       Once an entire county has voted dry, no smaller unit of that county can hold a separate election for voting wet except for cities of the first four classes. Accordingly, a county court should not order a local option election to be held in a county that has voted dry even though the petition filed with the court meets all the requirements of this section.

       When a local option election is confined to the corporate limits of the city, only those qualified voters residing within the city are entitled to sign the petition or to vote in the election; the clerk, in sending out the registration lists to the split precincts, should indicate which voters live within or without the city so that the election officers can lockout the local option election for those voters who may appear but who are not entitled to vote in the city election by virtue of being nonresidents.

       A county clerk cannot be held liable in a civil suit for making a petition for a local option election available to the public for inspection or having a copy made since, by law, it becomes a public record when it is filed subject to both inspection and copying; the mere fact that the petition is subsequently declared invalid for insufficient compliance with the statute would have no bearing on the clerk’s civil liability.

       Once a petition for a local option election is filed and duly recorded, it becomes a public record irrespective of whether or not it is found to meet the statutory requirements for validity and cannot be withdrawn. Thus, where the petition was ruled invalid for not containing a sufficient number of signatures, those favoring a referendum on the subject would be required to start over and submit an entirely new petition.

       If a petition could be valid despite the omission of Social Security numbers, it necessarily follows that an irregularity in the inclusion of the numbers, such as using voter’s files from the clerk’s office to add the numbers to the signed petition, would not necessarily invalidate the petition.

If this information is given, the clerk should be able to determine the identity of the person signing even though the actual signature may be illegible.

        Three (3)-year moratorium on local option elections provided for in subsection (5) of this section did not apply to a precinct located within a fourth class city which had voted to abolish prohibition; a precinct within a fourth class city is not the same territory as the city.

        In suit contesting local option election, negative testimony by contestant’s witnesses that they failed to see any notices posted in public places or elsewhere during two-week period prior to election, was insufficient to overcome positive testimony of sheriff and deputies that notices were posted in five conspicuous places in each precinct over 14 days before election.

        Where the places selected by officers for posting notice of local option election were not the most conspicuous, but were at least public places, the court was not convinced that such places were so inconspicuous as to fail to meet the requirements of this section, especially since the city wherein the election was held was small and nearly 1,000 people out of a total population of 2,375 voted in the election.

         8.— Substantial Compliance.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The doctrine of substantial compliance may be used to uphold the validity of a local option election if the appropriate authority attempts to comply with the statutory prerequisites concerning notice, but the compliance is in some way defective. However, where an official makes no effort to comply with the statute, that failure is fatal and the doctrine of substantial compliance cannot be utilized. Chumley v. Williams, 639 S.W.2d 557, 1982

        While the statute requires the sheriff to report in writing to the county court that such notices have been published and posted, yet such provision is not mandatory, and the failure of the sheriff to technically comply with the statute in that respect will not render the election invalid.

        Report of sheriff stating “Executed by posting notices and advertising in Harlan Daily Enterprise as directed” was a sufficient report that the sheriff had posted the notices required by this section, and in the absence of an allegation of fraud or mistake the report could not be collaterally attacked.

        Defect in sheriff’s return, in stating that he had advertised that “election would be held at least five times in conspicuous places in each precinct,” instead of stating that the handbills were posted in five conspicuous places in each precinct, was cured by amended answer and sheriff’s testimony in contest suit, showing proper advertisement.

        Failure of sheriff to report in writing to county courts that the notices of proposed election had been published and posted, which was an important process that should be observed, was not a mandatory provision after the election had been held, and issue as to whether notices were posted and published as required by law could be raised in a contest, though sheriff did not file his report, the difference being in the matter of the burden and weight of evidence.

        Where there was no allegation that sheriff failed to publish the required newspaper advertisements, sheriff’s return on back of printed notice certifying that the notice was printed and at least five were placed in each of the voting precincts, was sufficient compliance with this section and since there was no allegation of fraud or mistake truth of sheriff’s return could not be questioned collaterally under KRS

        Where county board of election commissioners made bona fide effort to appoint election officers within time prescribed by this section, but were unable to obtain persons willing to serve from list nominated by “wet” committee, and so were required to call for a new list, with result that officers were not appointed until five (5) days before election, the delay in appointing officers did not void the election in the absence of a showing of fraud or undue advantage in favor of successful side.

        Where it is sought to have votes eliminated on the ground that they were illegal because they were cast openly in the presence of other persons, the names of the persons casting the illegal votes must be alleged. This is true even though the allegation is that all of the votes cast in the precinct were illegal. Jackson v. Bolt, 292

        The negligent omission or wilful failure of the board of election commissioners to answer within the prescribed time a petition contesting a local option election will not justify a default judgment. In such case the court may reasonably extend the time for answering, and if no answer is filed the court should treat the petition as controverted. Keeling v. Coker, 294

        Where parties to a local option election contest stipulated to take no further proceedings until a certain date, both parties believing that liquor could not be sold after that date, the stipulation would not be set aside for mutual mistake because of a subsequent ruling by the alcoholic beverage control board, allowing liquor licenses to be issued after the stipulated date.

        Local option elections are within state “licensing and regulatory laws” for which an included city should be deemed to exist even after the adoption of an urban-county form of government. Therefore, the county unit rule would still apply to all of a county outside of that city, which would remain an independent unit for purposes of local option elections. The urban-county government charter may provide that future local option elections will not be bound by the “county unit” rule.

       <p>
        Order of circuit court, suspending operation of prohibition pending appeal from judgment in contest suit, was invalid insofar as it conditioned the suspension upon the appellants not pleading or relying upon the order of suspension in any prosecution brought against them for violating the local option law during the period of suspension. Keeling v. Coker, 294
        <cite class="ky_code">

        Courts have no power to postpone the date on which prohibition is to take effect but they may upon a showing of necessity for an injunction grant a temporary stay of enforcement of the prohibition law against the person seeking such a stay. Barger v. Ward, 407 S.W.2d 397, 1966

        Enforcement of prohibition is not automatically suspended by the filing of a suit to contest the election. Barger v. Ward, 407 S.W.2d 397, 1966

        While a court has no inherent equity power with regard to election contest cases it does have equity powers where election contests involve property rights that are in need of protection. Barger v. Ward, 407 S.W.2d 397, 1966

        Conviction of person on charge of selling whiskey in dry territory was no bar to a prosecution of the same person for possessing liquor, where first prosecution was based on sale of two pints of whiskey and second prosecution was based on possession of several pints of gin, found on premises on search under search warrant made one hour after the sale of the whiskey. The fact that the gin was in possession at the time of the sale of the whiskey did not restrict the conduct to one offense, since continuing to retain possession of the gin after the sale of the whiskey constituted a separate offense.

        Where the offense charged is the unlawful sale of liquor as distinguished from unlawful possession with the intention to sell, the name of the person to whom the accused sells the liquor must be stated or, if the facts warrant it, must be stated that the name of such person is unknown.

        Indictment was defective and demurrable because it did charge the “canned heat” was fit for beverage purposes, or that an intent to sell it for such use could be reasonably inferred from the accused having it in his possession. Gilbert v. Commonwealth, 325 S.W.2d 319, 1959

        Where the arresting officer claims he purchased nine cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and three cans of Drewry’s beer from the defendant, in addition to a half pint of whiskey, but at trial introduces 11 cans of Pabst and one can of Drewry’s, it is sufficient to convict the defendant of selling alcohol in dry territory under this section when the officer satisfactorily explained the extra cans of Pabst and the absence of two cans of Drewry's.

This section only prohibits the possession of alcoholic beverages when the possession is for the purpose of sale or possession has been acquired unlawfully. However, if there is evidence that the possession is unlawful, that is, for the purpose of sale, such evidence would not support a charge of disorderly conduct.

        It is not a violation of the local option law for persons belonging to a private club to have their own beverages, individually marked, stored at the club to be consumed when the members of the club so desire, provided that the club possesses no such beverages and that there is no sale of them.

        Although there is no specific quantity of alcoholic beverages that serves as a line of demarcation between unlawful possession or transportation of such beverages for the purpose of sale and lawful possession or transportation, as covered by this section, and each case must rest on its own particular facts, evidence of transportation of a large quantity of alcoholic beverages in dry territory raises an inference that such beverage was not possessed for personal or other legitimate use and is sufficient to support a conviction of the offense of transporting such beverages for the purpose of sale.

        When a person is arrested for illegally possessing or transporting alcoholic beverages in dry territory, in a vehicle, and the vehicle is seized by the arresting officers, the quarterly court has no jurisdiction to try the offense. Ritter v. Bruce, 239 S.W.2d 449, 1951

        Conviction of a third offense under this section may be had notwithstanding the second conviction was had in the quarterly court whose jurisdiction is limited to the imposition of a fine of not more than $100 and 60 days in jail.

        A judge of the police court of a fourth-class city can probate the jail sentence in a local option violation case so long as he follows the provisions of KRS

        In local option violations where the quarterly court and justices of the peace have concurrent jurisdiction, the quarterly court should try the case if that was the court before which the defendant was first brought.

        By enacting this section it was the intent of the legislature that an alien not personally hold an alcoholic beverage license, or direct the activities of a licensed business and even though alien shareholders are not precluded it must be recognized that stock ownership can reach a point that the shareholder’s interest becomes de facto control; in this sense the alcoholic beverage control board may consider the alien’s status in determining whether a license should be granted or denied.

Accordingly, it was infirm under the United States Supreme Court’s decision in

        In-person requirement of former KRS 243.155(1)(f)(1) and KRS 243.156(1)(h)(1) (repealed effective January 1, 2007) was not narrowly tailored to achieving the “core values” of U.S. Const. amend. XXI. Huber Winery v. Wilcher, 488 F. Supp. 2d 592, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60237 (W.D.

        Allowing in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers in certain circumstances while prohibiting out-of-state wineries from doing the same has no differential effect on the shipment of wine into dry territories; the statutory scheme under former KRS 241.010(22) and (45), KRS 243.155(2) and KRS

        (repealed effective January 1, 2007) discriminates based upon where the wine originates, not upon where it ends up; therefore, the in-state eligibility requirements are not narrowly tailored towards achieving temperance in dry territories.

Ed. 2d 796, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 4174 (2005), inasmuch as there is no showing that the provision burdens out-of-state producers or shippers simply to give a competitive advantage to in-state businesses.

       <p>
        The Commerce Clause does not require that out-of-state wineries be granted the exact same economic advantages as in-state wineries; however, the in-person requirement as it operates under KRS 243.155(2)(g) and KRS 244.165(2)(a) is protectionist and cannot stand.

       <p>
        The in-person requirement in KRS 243.155(2)(g) and KRS 244.165(2)(a) is unconstitutional as it discriminates in practical effect against out-of-state small farm wineries and has not been shown to advance the legitimate local purposes asserted that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.

        The limit in KRS 243.155(2)(g) and 244.165(2)(c) of shipments to two cases of wine per customer per visit to the winery is evenhanded, as nothing on the face of the statute favors in-state over out-of-state wineries with respect to the two-case limit.

        The determination of whether “substantial aggregations of population would otherwise not have reasonable access to a licensed vendor” is a matter of factfinding and not one of the exercise of discretionary power. Angel v. Palmer-Ball, 461 S.W.2d 105, 1970
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 613

       </p>
       <p>
        The alcoholic beverage control board was without authority to issue a license to sell distilled spirits and wine by the package under this provision of the statute without first making a specific finding of fact that substantial aggregations of populations would not have reasonable access to a licensed vendor if such license was not issued, and a general finding of ultimate fact that “the premises * * * meet all of the requirements of the laws and regulations * * * for a * * * license” was not sufficient to authorize the issuance of the license. Pearl v. Marshall, 491 S.W.2d 837, 1973

         Ky. LEXIS 608

       <p>
        Where the board merely recited “substantial aggregations of population would otherwise not have reasonable access to a license vendor unless the license sought by the applicant here is issued,” the Circuit Court was correct in holding that just recitation of an ultimate fact was insufficient to withstand judicial review.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The words “aggregations of population” of subsection (3) (now subsection (6)(a)) of this section connote a relatively fixed and stable body of people in the immediate vicinity of the rural premises involved and do not include casual transients nor the residents of an adjacent dry territory.

        The words, “aggregations of population,” as used in subsection (3) (now subsection (6)(a)) of this section do not include the residents of adjacent dry territory. Simms v. Angel, 513 S.W.2d 176, 1974

        Where the present holder of a valid retail package liquor license issued for premises situated in the rural or nonincorporated area of a county applies “to transfer” the license to another rural location in the same county and within the same general geographic area, it is within the discretionary power of the alcoholic beverage control board to approve and authorize such “transfer” if the applicant for the new license has previously shown that substantial aggregations of population would not otherwise have reasonable access to a licensed vendor. Hagan v. Knippenberg, 549 S.W.2d 509, 1976
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 151

       </p>
       <p>
        It is only where there is a distinction between the area being served and the area to be served that a finding that substantial aggregations of population would not otherwise have reasonable access to a vendor would be required. Hagan v. Knippenberg, 549 S.W.2d 509, 1976

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record is devoid of any evidence showing that substantial aggregations of population would not have reasonable access to a vendor if application to transfer is denied, the granting of a retail package liquor license for premises not located within a city was an abuse of discretion.

        Where voters in county local option election voted to legalize sale of alcoholic beverages and the county was allotted quota of retail package liquor licenses which quota was filled, nonsuccessful applicants who were admittedly qualified and to whose application no protest was made had standing to appeal administrator’s refusal to grant them licenses; however, trial court’s error in finding that there was no appeal from such refusal was harmless since the quota of licenses had been filled and the appeal would thus be an exercise in futility.

        The law prohibits an arbitrary selection or rejection of applicants for licenses and requires the exercise of sound discretion in such action and, since a lottery system is an arbitrary method of rejecting or selecting an application and involves no discretion, this method is not permitted under the law.

        This section allows the refusal of a license only after the administrator has exercised his or her discretion by considering certain substantive factors, several of which are listed and the section does not provide the administrator with the authority to reject applicants for licenses by any other means; therefore, the administrator does not possess the statutory authority to accept or reject certain applicants by use of a lottery system.

        Any licensee selling malt beverages to customers at a price which does not match, if not exceed, his “cost,” as defined in KRS 365.030(3), is in violation of KRS 365.030(1), assuming sales below cost are for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition. Assuming the retail price does not reflect the cost factors specified by statute, two remedies are available: first, the violator will be subject to a fine and/or imprisonment pursuant to KRS 365.990(2); second, the violator’s license may be revoked pursuant to this section.

        Where a malt beverage distributor licensee sells a quantity of a brand of malt beverages to retail licensee “A” at $25.00 per half barrel and the same product and quantity to retail licensee “B” at $29.00 per half barrel, if the rebate or discount is secretly made “to the injury of a competitor and tends to destroy competition” the distributor licensee is in violation of KRS 365.050. If the board deems a violation of KRS 365.050 to be a sufficient cause for revocation of a license, a show cause hearing may be held to determine if such violation has in fact occurred.

        The fact that alcoholic beverage control board, after finding wholesaler guilty of violating O.P.A. ceilings in sale of whiskey, merely suspended his license for 25 days instead of revoking the license, did not bar the board, on ground of res adjudicata or double punishment, from refusing subsequent application of wholesaler for renewal of his license for the following year, particularly where there was evidence that suspension was given at request of federal officials prosecuting licensee and confederates in federal court, and the proceedings in the federal court subsequently developed the serious extent of the licensees’ violations.

      Within three (3) days after any order of revocation of a license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once surrender its license to the department.If the license revoked is for premises located in any city that has a police force of its own, the department, immediately upon mailing notice of the revocation of the license to the licensee, shall mail to the chief of the police department of that city a written notice stating the fact of the revocation, the name of the licensee whose license was revoked, the address of the premises that had been licensed under the revoked license, and the date of the revocation. If the license revoked is for premises that are not located in any city with a police force of its own, the department shall in like manner and at like time mail a similar notice to the sheriff of the county in which the premises are located. If the revoked license is not surrendered at once by the licensee, the chief of the police department or sheriff shall, at the request of the department, immediately cause one of its officers to take physical possession of the license and return it to the department.

        Where voters in county local option election voted to legalize sale of alcoholic beverages and the county was allotted quota of retail package liquor licenses which quota was filled, nonsuccessful applicants who were admittedly qualified and to whose application no protest was made had standing to appeal administrator’s refusal to grant them licenses; however, trial court’s error in finding that there was no appeal from such refusal was harmless since the quota of licenses had been filled and the appeal would thus be an exercise in futility.

       <p>
        The term “party” as used in this section clearly means a party of record in the proceedings. Bartholomew v. Paniello, 287 S.W.2d 616, 1956
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 476

        </cite>
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only a “party” may appeal to the Court of Appeals from the circuit court under this section. Kelly v. Marino, 358 S.W.2d 519, 1962
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 188

        </cite>
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Kentucky state racing commission is charged with the duty of protecting substantial public interest and is therefore a representative of this interest in all proceedings, it was a “party aggrieved” within the purview of this section and can maintain the appeal. Kentucky State Racing Com. v. Fuller, 481 S.W.2d 298, 1972

        Where an employee of a retail licensee sells alcoholic beverages to a minor the retail licensee is held to a strict liability standard for the direct illegal acts of his employee. Although the offense might be directly committed by the employee, the retail business is held accountable. For this reason, both the retail licensee and the employee should each be charged with the same offense.

      In a town where teenage drinking is a problem, a police plan involving an 18-year-old “under cover” agent who would be a willing volunteer, whose appearance and character would indicate his true age, and whose parents would have given their permission, would enter an establishment with a liquor license, in which a plain clothes officer would be present as an observer, ask to buy a drink or package goods, would have no identification if asked, would give his correct age if asked, would take a breathalizer test both before and after entering the suspected business, and would say nothing to mislead the seller into thinking he had proper identification elsewhere, would not be subject to a valid defense of entrapment, nor would it subject either the 18-year-old agent or the observing police officer to prosecution under this section, KRS 244.085(2) or (3), since both officer and agent would be engaged in a legitimate police investigation.

        In a town where teenage drinking is a problem, a police plan involving an 18-year-old “under cover” agent who would be a willing volunteer, whose appearance and character would indicate his true age, and whose parents would have given their permission, would enter an establishment with a liquor license, in which a plain clothes officer would be present as an observer, ask to buy a drink or package goods, would have no identification if asked, would give his correct age if asked, would take a breathalizer test both before and after entering the suspected business, and would say nothing to mislead the seller into thinking he had proper identification elsewhere, would not be subject to a valid defense of entrapment, nor would it subject either the 18-year-old agent or the observing police officer to prosecution under KRS

       Although subsection (2) of this section permits duly licensed retailers to advertise in newspapers, magazines or periodicals that may be published in a “dry” county, subsection (1) of this section prohibits advertising by circulars, handbills and nonqualifying publications.

       A brewery cannot pursuant to 804 KAR 1:080 (1) place any advertisements in a college student directory published by a noneducational, private business concern and therefore the placing of advertisements by such an alcoholic beverage licensee in a college student directory would not come within the exception to the prohibition against advertising contained in subsection (2) of this section.

       The word, “patron,” as contained in subsection (2) of this section does not include a licensee that pays an advertising fee for inclusion in the printed materials.

       Where a large beer producer sponsored a raquetball tournament, and, in conjunction with it, wished to give each participant a T-shirt advertising its products, it could do so, under subdivision (2)(c), as a uniform of a “sporting team” since a “team” requires two or more people and raquetball can be an individual sport.

       Subdivision (2)(b) of this section does not limit or restrict advertising on radio and television but this section merely prohibits the board from banning the type of advertisement described in the subdivision; it does not prohibit the advertising of the price of alcoholic beverages.

        The Commerce Clause does not require that out-of-state wineries be granted the exact same economic advantages as in-state wineries; however, the in-person requirement as it operates under KRS 243.155(2)(g) and KRS 244.165(2)(a) is protectionist and cannot stand.

        (now repealed), authorizing admission of evidence as to defendant’s reputation for engaging in illegal traffic in liquor, applies only to prosecutions under the local option law, and there is no similar statute governing prosecutions under the alcoholic beverage control law. Therefore, in prosecution for illegal possession of a still, under this section, it was prejudicial error to admit evidence as to defendant’s general reputation for selling liquor. Stephens v. Commonwealth, 303

        In a prosecution under this section, where the only evidence of guilt of defendants was that they were found in the vicinity of the still with a sack of jars or jugs, and another person admitted he was the sole owner of the still, the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction, since the evidence at most indicated that defendants were prospective customers of the still owner.

        The legality of a retailer’s proposal to sell alcoholic beverages on a “lay-away” plan depends upon whether the terms of the “lay-away” plan at the outset involve a contract to sell rather than a present sale, with title passing on payment and delivery. If the transaction represents a contract to sell on the part of the retailer or an option to purchase on the part of the customer-purchaser, title has not passed and no binding sale for credit has occurred; on the other hand, if the lay-away plan involves a present sale with only payment and delivery postponed, the retailer-seller would clearly have completed a sale and passed title without receiving full remuneration thereby violating this section.

       The underwriting of a $50,000 stakes race purse at a race track by a brewery company did not violate this section since it was the manufacturer and not the licensee, which was offering the “prize” and, the prize was not offered “in connection with the sale of malt beverages,” inasmuch as the purchase of such beverages was not required of persons who wished to participate in the race. Although the event might build goodwill for the brewery company thereby indirectly increasing sales of its product, the relationship between the prize and the purchase of the brewery’s products was so remote as to remove the event from the scope of this section.

      In enacting this section, the 1982 General Assembly clearly articulated its policy to supplant the free and open market determination of distributor arrangements by requiring a written agreement between the distributor and brewer or supplier which defines the distributor’s exclusive territory; however, the section fails to provide for adequate state supervision over this policy since the determination of the exclusive territories is accomplished by private parties rather than by the state and the state does not regulate or “police” the enforcement of these exclusive territorial arrangements entered into by private parties. Thus, even though the exclusive territories for distributors are required by this section, the arrangements are not immune from antitrust scrutiny under the state action doctrine; whether the conduct contemplated by the section violates the antitrust laws would depend upon the factual circumstances surrounding the particular arrangement and the existence of an illegal restraint of trade.

      This section represents a vertical restraint between the brewer or supplier and the distributor by confining the distributor to a particular area of operation (plus various other restrictions relating to sale and quality control); these vertical nonprice restraints contained the potential to promote interbrand competition by allowing the manufacturer to achieve certain efficiencies in the distribution of his products and, moreover, society’s increasing demand that manufacturers directly assume responsibility for the safety and quality of their products constitutes a legitimate reason or justification for manufacturer control over the manner in which his product is sold. Accordingly, there is a rational relationship, for equal protection purposes, between the classification and the objectives justifying it; the statute also withstands a due process analysis in that it bears a reasonable relationship to the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages.

      In order to effectuate the intent of this section and to construe subsection (3) of this section in harmony with the other subsections, the phrase “brewer and supplier” in the last sentence of subsection (3) must be interpreted as “brewer or supplier” and thus subsection (3) must be interpreted to require the prior written approval of the supplier or brewer for the sale of a particular brand of malt beverage.
