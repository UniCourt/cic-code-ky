       </h5>
       <p>
        The adoption of KRS Chapter 186A in conjunction with the existing provisions of this chapter, had the effect of changing the law of Kentucky from an equitable title state to a certificate of title state for the purposes of determining ownership of a motor vehicle for liability insurance requirements. The general law of sales is no longer applicable to such a situation because of the statute. Potts v. Draper, 864 S.W.2d 896, 1993

Although the purchaser had driven the vehicle off of the auto seller’s lot a few days earlier, the auto seller did not meet both requirements of transferring ownership of the vehicle without assigning a certificate of title, set forth in KRS 186A.220(5), because the auto seller did not obtain the purchaser’s consent to file the certificate of title and other documents on the purchaser’s behalf and did not verify that the purchaser had obtained insurance on the vehicle before relinquishing possession.

        is not the correct definition to apply to vehicle forfeiture under the controlled substances chapter. While KRS ch. 218A does not specifically define “owner,” KRS 218A.405(1)(b) and (5)(b) define “interest in property” and “trustee.” Defining “owner” as one who has an interest in property when title is being held by another appropriately prevents a drug dealer from titling vehicles or other property in someone else’s name in order to use the property in illegal activity and escape forfeiture.

        This section does not contemplate or authorize a conditional sale without transfer of title. The language used in the statute is intended to distinguish those leases which in reality are sales, or at the option of the leasee can be converted into a sale from a short term lease of less than 365 days with no right of purchase. Certainly conditional sales can be appropriate, but the vendor cannot disregard other statutes which are universal and compulsory in nature. Rogers v. Wheeler, 864 S.W.2d 892, 1993

        Transaction was not a conditional sale since used car dealer was not holding title to the van until full performance of the contract terms by the buyers where dealer transferred title to buyers one week after accident occurred even though they never finished paying for the van; therefore, where title had been assigned to used car dealer and the transaction between used car dealer and buyer was not a conditional sale, and where insurer insured all motor vehicles owned by used car dealer, van was insured by used car dealer’s insurer on the day of the collision.

        Under the Uniform Commercial Code, KRS 355.1-203, an agreement between a trust and a debtor constituted a security interest rather than an unexpired lease, as the rental payments over the term of the agreement reflected a purchase price of the vehicles with interest; nor was the agreement an executory contract as defined by 11 U.S.C.S. 365, as the debtor had no continuing obligations under the agreement other than payment. Further, under the Motor Vehicle Registration Act, KRS 186.010(7)(b), a conditional lessee, such as the debtor, could be considered the owner for the purposes of registering the vehicle, which the undisputed evidence showed was done, rendering the trust’s reliance on KRS

        KRS 186A.220(5) permits the customary practice of dealers in Kentucky of taking the applicable documents to the clerk’s office on behalf of the buyer, and so long as the seller and buyer complete the necessary paperwork at the time of the sale and then one of the parties promptly submits papers to the county clerk, title passes at the time of the sale for liability insurance purposes; thus, auto dealer following customary practice was relieved of all of its duties, including the responsibility to provide liability insurance prior to date of buyer’s accident.

      Since the legislature intended that legislative district should mean state representative district, this section permits the county clerk of Knott County to establish one branch office in the county for the purpose of issuing license plates during the vehicle license period, but would not empower him to take license plates into each voting precinct for that purpose. The one branch office could be located at the voting place in a precinct provided that the voting place is a building used for a public purpose.

        Where amendment to law providing for registration of vehicles changed time of registration from “on or before the first day of January of each and every year” to “on or before the first day of March of each and every year” law did not change the registration year so as to make it begin on March 1 instead of January 1, but merely gave automobile owners a two-month grace period during which they might continue to operate an automobile registered for the previous year.

        Where a wife was injured while riding in a car driven by her husband, the bill of sale for the car was made to the wife, the conditional sales contract for the car was made by her, and the car was licensed in her name, the statements of the husband and wife that the car was owned by their son were not sufficient to overcome the presumption raised by the documents that she owned it.

      Before the special free license plates are issued by the department of revenue (now revenue cabinet), the department (now cabinet) may require proof that the claimant did, in fact, receive financial assistance from the veterans administration under 38 USCS § 1901 and that he is now being paid disability compensation by the veterans administration pursuant to 38 USCS, §§ 301-360.

      The issuance of a special automobile plate to a disabled veteran does not relieve him as the owner from payment of ad valorem property taxes on the vehicle.

     <p>
      Since the benefit bestowed in this section is tied in exclusively with 38 USCS § 1901, the free certificate and license plates authorized by this section are confined to the one vehicle provided by the veterans’ administration and there is no statutory authority for selling the special “Handicapped Veteran” license plates.

      Although a National Guard member may only have a special license plate for one vehicle at a time, a guardsman must pay only a one time registration fee regardless of how long he keeps his vehicle or how often he changes vehicles and transfers the plate from one vehicle to the next.

      The prohibition on cities under former subsection (4) of this section from imposing any automobile license fee was restricted to one vehicle owned by a qualifying veteran; accordingly, any additional motor vehicle owned by the disabled veteran would require the veteran to pay the regular motor vehicle license fee levied by the city.

        Subsection (3) of this section (now subsection 6, pursuant to the 2003 amendment) originally charged an additional penalty fee for late compliance, but allowed the secured party to perfect his security interest in the motor vehicle, while the 1978 amendment to subsection (3) (now subsection 6) cut off the secured party’s ability to perfect his security interest under KRS Chapters 355 and 186 if the secured party does not comply within 15 days from the date the security agreement was executed; it therefore seems that subsection (3) (now subsection 6) as amended is at best a mistake which is not truly indicative of the legislative intent.

        Subsection (9) of this section allows the transportation of coal from the mine to an unloading point within 50 air miles of the mine whether the unloading point is a railhead, tipple, plant, barge or any other location which is no more than 50 air miles from the mine where the coal was dug, in order to qualify for the 40% fee charge.

        When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, the statute must be applied to those terms without resort to any construction or interpretation; as subsection (9) specifies that to receive a fee reduction, the operator of a motor vehicle having a declared gross weight in excess of eighteen thousand pounds must “exclusively” transport primary forest products, operators who transport other products are not entitled to the fee reduction.

     <p>
      The terms registration year and registration period are synonymous; the registration year is, therefore, determined by the birth date of the owner. The legislative intent is that a registration period or year must commence on the birth month of the owner; therefore, when there is a new owner, a new registration period begins, based on the birth month of the new owner.

     <p>
      The termination of a registration period is marked by the occurrence of either one of two contingencies whichever happens first: the birth month of the owner of the vehicle or the transfer of ownership of the vehicle; under this interpretation, the new owner is not entitled to be credited with the unexpired time of the previous owner’s registration.

      The Transportation Cabinet must assess registration fees on vehicle transfers in accordance with statutory requirements and may not credit the new owner with the unexpired time on the registration plate.

      A registration for greater than 12 months constitutes a single registration; therefore, even though a registration year should exceed 12 calendar months, the clerk is not entitled to more than a $2.00 fee.

      Any motor vehicle properly registered and titled in another state belonging to a nonresident, which vehicle is required to be registered in this state by reason of lack of reciprocal agreement with the state in which it is registered, or by reason of not qualifying for reciprocity under an existing reciprocal agreement with the state in which it is registered, may be registered with the county clerk by presenting a photostat or certified copy of the registration receipt or certificate of title issued to the nonresident in his home state. The registration receipt issued by the county clerk shall be stamped across its face with a notation prescribed by the cabinet that will indicate the registration receipt so issued cannot be used in transferring legal title to the motor vehicle. However, under regulations prescribed by the cabinet, a registration receipt so issued may be transferred to a new owner if the foreign legal title and registration is transferred in that state to the new owner. Nothing contained in this section shall release the owner of the vehicle from any tax fees or other requirements imposed by law.

        Legislature intended the statute to apply to both temporary and permanent license plates, and the conclusion that this is the correct interpretation is reinforced by the language an administrative regulation, which governs the issuance and physical appearance of temporary tags, uses the term “temporary registration plates,” which strongly suggests that the requirements of the statute are applicable to temporary tags. Kennedy v. Commonwealth, 488 S.W.3d 41, 2016

        Because the manner in which the temporary tag was displayed in the driver's car violated the legibility requirement of the statute, the officer's stop was justified, and the circuit court properly denied the motion to suppress. Kennedy v. Commonwealth, 488 S.W.3d 41, 2016

        Unpublished decision:
        Officers had probable cause to stop defendant for failing to have illumination of a rear license plate at night as required by KRS 186.170(1), even though the vehicle had a temporary license tag taped to the window; while the statute contained no specific provision dealing with temporary license tags, such lack did not imply that temporary tags need not be illuminated at night, but rather supported the proposition that temporary tags were subject to the same illumination requirements as permanent plates.

        Although a statutory lien on the vehicle is created on behalf of a county clerk when a check to him for registration fee is dishonored, he may not make a note of such lien on the registration receipt.

        There is no statutory provision for the recordation of a clerk’s lien on a vehicle registered in the clerk’s office by payment of a check which is later dishonored upon presentment for payment.

        Since this section provides no method for the enforcement of the lien that it creates in subsection (8), the clerk, where the check bounces, can either sue: (1) by way of ordinary action to collect the debt; or (2) by way of an equitable type action in circuit court to have the debt satisfied out of the vehicle to which the lien applies and the lien could only be binding on those affected persons having actual notice of the lien.

        Subsection (9) of this section, which prohibits the alienability or transfer of a motor vehicle while a lien is still on it, is clearly unconstitutional since it promotes no perceptible and clear legitimate public interest and has no reasonable relation to such police power objects as public safety, health, peace, good order or morals; thus, the statutory restraint is unreasonable and arbitrary under Ky. Const., § 2.

        Where the original purchaser of a mobile home purports to transfer any interest he has in the home to a third party through a “transfer of equity and assumption agreement” with the third party’s assumption of the remaining obligation due under the original security agreement covering the vehicle, the county clerk should accept the transfer and note the lien on the new registration certificate issued to the new owner, since subsection (9) of this section, which restricts alienability of vehicles while a lien exists, is clearly unconstitutional, and since KRS 355.9-311 permits the alienability of a secured transaction debtor’s rights.

        The practice of setting up a roadblock for motor vehicles for the purpose of requiring the driver to display an operator’s license is not an arrest or illegal restraint or search nor can it be regarded as exercising arbitrary power over the lives, liberty and property of free men which power is denied by Ky. Const., § 2; therefore evidence obtained entirely and solely by such procedure that driver did not have or display a driver’s license is admissible in prosecution for driving without a license.

       <p>
        This section does not violate equal protection of the law on the theory that it treats driver’s license applicants with suspended out-of-state licenses differently from driver’s license applicants with suspended Kentucky licenses; this section is rationally related to the two legitimate purposes of protecting the public from drivers whose licenses have been suspended for DUI offenses and of preventing “license shopping” by nonresidents with suspended out-of-state licenses.

       <p>
        This section compels denial of a Kentucky license to a nonresident during such time as his license remains revoked in the issuing state; the word “nonresident” refers to the status of the driver at the time of revocation and that an individual who moves to Kentucky cannot successfully avoid the provisions of the statute by the simple expedient of changing his residence.

        Failure to produce a clearance letter from another state which showed that the license issued to driver by that state was no longer suspended was sufficient grounds for this state’s refusal to issue an operator’s license under the provisions of this section and 601 KAR 12:020, even though the requirement of a clearance letter was the only one of several license reinstatement conditions the driver had not met.

        The practice of setting up a roadblock for motor vehicles for the purpose of requiring the driver to display an operator’s license is not an arrest or illegal restraint or search nor can it be regarded as exercising arbitrary power over the lives, liberty and property of free men which power is denied by Ky.

        A police officer may not take a person’s driver’s license from him and require the person to drive to the courthouse without a license; all that a police officer can do is to require a person to display his operator’s license, for only in the case where the driver’s license is counterfeit or is not the license of the person carrying it would it be contraband such as to justify an officer in taking it from the person.

        The legislative purpose in having Kentucky join the nonresident violator compact was to allow peace officers who cite a nonresident motorist for a traffic violation to issue a citation to the violator who is a resident of a member state with the assurance that the violator’s home state will enforce Kentucky’s citation.

        If a nonresident has a valid driver’s license from another state and thus has the privilege of driving on Kentucky’s highways, Kentucky cannot withdraw that privilege without affording him a due process hearing; however, if the driver’s out-of-state license has been suspended or revoked, there is no privilege to withdraw since the nonresident’s home state has already canceled or suspended his operator’s license and he has no right or privilege to drive on Kentucky’s highways. There is no need to hold a hearing pursuant to subsection (2) (now subsection (4)) of this section to withdraw driving privileges of a nonresident motorist, where the nonresident driver has no legal authority to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of this state.

        Writ of prohibition was inappropriate based on a judge’s lack of jurisdiction to sua sponte invalidate Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186.574(6) as district courts had subject-matter jurisdiction over traffic offenses, and the alleged errors implicated particular-case jurisdiction, which belonged to the erroneous action category of writs.

        Writ of prohibition based on erroneous action was properly granted where a judge’s order that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186.574(6) was unconstitutional affected the county attorney’s ability to exercise statutory and prosecutorial authority, no actual litigant had raised the issue, the statute’s constitutionality was not essential to the motions before the judge, there was a lack of notice and due process to the county attorney, the Attorney General was not joined as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 418.075(1), and the judge’s decision violated separation of powers. Delahanty v. Commonwealth, 558 S.W.3d 489, 2018

        Administrative action suspending or revoking motorist’s operator’s license should be attended by a hearing with all due process, and judicial review of such action would be based on whether the action was arbitrary on the basis of the record. In case where license was suspended for six months without hearing, Circuit Court judgment suspending it for 45 days could not be questioned by the Department of Public Safety (now Transportation Cabinet), as its decision was given more validity than it deserved.

        An action against the parent of a minor, under this section, for personal injuries arising from negligent operation of an automobile by the minor, is an action for personal injuries governed by the one-year period of limitation fixed by KRS 413.140(1)(a), and not an action upon a liability created by statute for which a five-year period of limitation is fixed by KRS 413.120(2). The fact that a judgment has been obtained against the minor, and that the judgment may be conclusive against the parent on the questions of negligence and damages, makes no difference. Robinson v.

        It is not competent for the general assembly to make the mere failure to secure an operator’s license prima facie evidence of negligent driving, since such a violation of law has no evidentiary relation to or logical tendency to prove the fact of negligence. Tipton v. Estill Ice Co., 279

        In an action arising from a motor vehicle accident in a parking lot, the trial court properly precluded the plaintiff from introducing evidence that the defendant’s driver’s license had been suspended because of his failure to attend alcohol classes following a prior alcohol-related motorcycle accident in which he had sustained personal injuries, since the fact of consequence in the action was whether the manner in which the defendant operated his vehicle was a substantial factor in causing the accident and his status as a licensed or unlicensed driver did not tend to prove or disprove that fact.

       Where one company filed a financing statement in September of 1979, listing a mobile home, with an accompanying affidavit that the mobile home would not be used on public highways, and a second company filed a financing statement in October of 1979, listing the same mobile home, with an accompanying license registration receipt issued by the county clerk’s office on which the second company was listed as the first lienholder on the mobile home, the fact that at the time of the filing of the first company’s financing statement there was no certificate of registration for the mobile home in existence in no way militates against the principle that the proper filing of the financing statement perfected the lien; the county clerk is now required to note the first lien of the company that filed the September statement on the certificate of registration that came into existence later.

      Since the clerk is not personally responsible for determining how the house trailer is being used, he may rely upon the secured party’s representation that it is or is not subject to registration, and may rely upon the secured party’s representation that a financing statement is all that is required, or if the secured party also presents a registration receipt, he may note the lien thereon.

        If the Automated Vehicle Information System does not have the technical capabilities to store more than two liens and there is no other place to store the information, then obviously the clerk cannot store the additional lien and will be responsible to file them in some other form as well as filing it in the same manner as lis pendens are filed.

       Opinions of Attorney General.

     </p>
     <p>
      The terms registration year and registration period are synonymous; the registration year is, therefore, determined by the birth date of the owner. The legislative intent is that a registration period or year must commence on the birth month of the owner; therefore, when there is a new owner, a new registration period begins, based on the birth month of the new owner.

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The termination of a registration period is marked by the occurrence of either one of two contingencies whichever happens first: the birth month of the owner of the vehicle or the transfer of ownership of the vehicle; under this interpretation, the new owner is not entitled to be credited with the unexpired time of the previous owner’s registration.

     <ol>
      <li id="tXVIc186As186A.060ol11">

        KRS 134.810(4), which requires that the purchaser shall become liable for the taxes on motor vehicles does not violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const., Amend. 14; these taxes are paid only if the purchaser desires to register the motor vehicle for use upon the highway. Nor is the exclusion of dealers of motor vehicles from payment of these tax liens objectionable since the dealer is a mere conduit by and through which title is passed from one owner to another and no one — dealer or individual — is required to obtain a certificate of registration until such time as the motor vehicle is to be operated upon the highways of the state.

        Because the plain language of the mortgage contract did not grant the lender a lien on debtor’s manufactured home as personal property, the lender did not obtain a security interest in the manufactured home through the mortgage contract, and even if the lender had obtained a lien against the manufactured home by way of the mortgage contract, it was undisputed that the lender did not note the security interest on the certificate of title, and the filing of a lis pendens could not serve to perfect a security interest in a manufactured home; accordingly, before the state-court foreclosure judgment, the lender did not have a perfected lien on debtor’s manufactured home.

       <p>
        The public must be able to rely upon documents certified by the county clerk’s office and, in spite of the danger of forged releases, a release noted upon a certificate of title by a duly appointed deputy clerk is effective; therefore, since the certificate of title governs and the filing of a financing statement is unnecessary for perfection and priority, a secured creditor is not required to search the records.

        Since subsection (2) of this section and former KRS 355.9-302(3) clearly and unambiguously provide that, as to any property for which a certificate of title is required by KRS Chapter 186A, a security interest in that property may be perfected or discharged only by a notation in that vein on the certificate of title, fact that mobile home was affixed to real estate was of no merit and notation on the certificate of title served as the exclusive method for perfecting bank’s security interest therein and bank was entitled to possess the mobile home upon default of promissory note.

        Since the final act necessary perfection is notation by the clerk of the lien on the certificate of title, and it is only when a security interest is actually noted on the title are other creditors foreclosed conclusively from obtaining a superior lien, regardless of the prior submission of the appropriate documents and fees by a enabling secured party, a contract creditor can acquire a superior interest until such time as the county clerk notes the enabling creditor’s lien on the title. Because the lender’s security interest was not perfected until more than 20 days after debtor received possession of the vehicle, the enabling loan exception was inapplicable. Brock v.

        Because the plain language of the mortgage contract did not grant the lender a lien on debtor’s manufactured home as personal property, the lender did not obtain a security interest in the manufactured home through the mortgage contract, and even if the lender had obtained a lien against the manufactured home by way of the mortgage contract, it was undisputed that the lender did not note the security interest on the certificate of title, and the filing of a lis pendens could not serve to perfect a security interest in a manufactured home; accordingly, before the state-court foreclosure judgment, the lender did not have a perfected lien on debtor’s manufactured home.

        ; thus, because the mobile home had an active certificate of title and had not been converted, a security interest could only be perfected under KRS 186A.190(1) by notation on the certificate of title. The court rejected the creditor’s argument that because the priority scheme in KRS 355.9-334(5)(d) provided a mechanism for a mortgage to have priority over a security interest in a titled mobile home, that this meant the mobile home could be perfected other than by a notation on its title.

        Trustee could not avoid a creditor’s lien on debtor’s manufactured home as a hypothetical lien creditor, as creditor properly perfected its security interest under Kentucky law. The requirement in the statute that creditor file a title lien statement in the county clerk’s office where debtor resided was unambiguous and fully supported by existing case law, and there was nothing in the statute that supported trustee’s position that creditor should have filed its lien in the county of debtor’s intended residence rather than the county where he resided when he purchased the manufactured home.

Further, under the Motor Vehicle Registration Act, KRS 186.010(7)(b), a conditional lessee, such as the debtor, could be considered the owner for the purposes of registering the vehicle, which the undisputed evidence showed was done, rendering the trust’s reliance on KRS

        Automobile dealership was deemed the owner of a truck for insurance purposes where, after relinquishing possession of the truck to the purchasing driver, the dealership waited 39 days to transfer title, during which time the driver was in an accident.

        There is no duty on part of seller of motor vehicle to require titling of vehicle prior to relinquishing possession of it; therefore title passed from commercial car dealer to buyer to second buyer, an uninsured motorist, when each buyer received the properly assigned certificate of title, a properly executed vehicle transaction record and a registration receipt and thus second buyer who failed to file the documents with the county clerk’s office was liable for accident that occurred after first buyer gave second buyer the necessary title transfer documents.

        Vehicle dealer and the dealer’s insurer were entitled to summary judgment in a wrongful death suit arising from the use of a vehicle the dealer sold to another seller, despite the dealer possessing title, because the dealer was not the vehicle’s owner, as (1) the dealer substantially complied with the directory requirements of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186A.220(1) through (4) at the time of the accident, and (2) the proof of insurance requirement in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 186A.220(5) was irrelevant in a dealer-to-dealer transaction, as a purchaser for use was different from a purchaser for resale, so the vehicle’s ultimate purchaser was the owner.

        There is no duty on part of seller of motor vehicle to require titling of vehicle prior to relinquishing possession of it; therefore title passed from commercial car dealer to buyer to second buyer, an uninsured motorist, when each buyer received the properly assigned certificate of title, a properly executed vehicle transaction record and a registration receipt and thus second buyer who failed to file the documents with the county clerk’s office was liable for accident that occurred after first buyer gave second buyer the necessary title transfer documents.

        Bankruptcy court did not commit clear error when it found that a creditor did not meet its burden of showing that debts a debtor owed the creditor were nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(2)(A), (a)(4), and (a)(6). The district court rejected the creditor’s claim that the debt was nondischargeable under § 523(a)(4) because KRS 186A.220(5) created a trust for the creditor’s benefit that the debtor breached when a used car dealership he co-owned with his brother sold cars “out of trust,” in violation of an agreement the dealership entered with the creditor to obtain credit.

        Because the statutory duties of this section of the motor vehicle code concerning transfer of title govern in this situation and were not performed by purchaser of the vehicle in question and the Uniform Commercial Code provisions of KRS 355.9-307(1) do not govern the determination of whether a sale had occurred in this situation, there was no sale completed by debtor to purchaser and debtor/seller of vehicle was justified in liquidating the vehicle to satisfy its security interest.

        The title retained by a motor vehicle dealer must be assigned, and hence fully executed, as a prerequisite to effectuating the transfer of title to the vehicle; in other words, the dealer’s duty to complete and sign the certificate of title assignment is paramount to his duty to actually deliver the completed paperwork to the county clerk’s office—the former duty cuts to the very heart of the contract, whereas the latter duty is akin to a mere ministerial function.

        When a car dealer sells a car, KRS 186A.220(5) creates an exception to the general statutory scheme that makes the title holder the owner of a vehicle for insurance purposes; however, a car dealer can only take advantage of the exception by first verifying that the buyer has a valid and current insurance policy that covers the purchased vehicle.

        Under KRS 186A.220(5), the buyer of a car who was involved in a car accident the day after the purchase was the owner of the vehicle for insurance purposes even though the buyer had not yet received the title papers for the vehicle because, in taking possession of the vehicle, the buyer showed the seller, a car dealer, proof of insurance coverage for the vehicle and agreed to allow the seller, who had not yet received a certificate of title from the prior owner, to forward the certificate of title and the necessary title transfer and registration papers directly to the county clerk on the buyer’s behalf.

        Where a car dealer did not obtain a purchaser’s consent to file a certificate of title and other documents and did not verify that the purchaser had insurance as required by KRS 186A.220(5), the dealer was the “owner” of a vehicle for insurance purposes at the time of an accident; therefore, the trial court properly determined that a guardian was entitled to summary judgment.

Although the purchaser had driven the vehicle off of the auto seller’s lot a few days earlier, the auto seller did not meet both requirements of transferring ownership of the vehicle without assigning a certificate of title, set forth in KRS 186A.220(5), because the auto seller did not obtain the purchaser’s consent to file the certificate of title and other documents on the purchaser’s behalf and did not verify that the purchaser had obtained insurance on the vehicle before relinquishing possession.

        Creditor’s objection to a Chapter 13 plan on the grounds that the plan impermissibly sought to modify its claim under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1322(b)(2) was overruled because notwithstanding whether the debtors’

        ; thus, because the mobile home had an active certificate of title and had not been converted, a security interest could only be perfected under KRS 186A.190(1) by notation on the certificate of title. The court rejected the creditor’s argument that because the priority scheme in KRS 355.9-334(5)(d) provided a mechanism for a mortgage to have priority over a security interest in a titled mobile home, that this meant the mobile home could be perfected other than by a notation on its title.

Even had the creditor provided sufficient evidence that its lien was noted on a certificate of title issued before the debtor’s petition was filed, it still could not overcome the fact that it filed the title lien statement in the wrong county under KRS 186A.190(2) and thus, because the creditor’s lien on the mobile home was not properly perfected at the time the debtor filed bankruptcy, the trustee had superior title to the mobile home pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(a)(1) and was entitled to recover the value of the debtor’s interest in the mobile home for the benefit of the estate pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 550.

        Trustee could avoid a mortgage lender’s interest in debtor’s manufactured home because, under Kentucky law pertaining to perfection of its lien, the lender was required to either note its lien on the certificate of title to the mobile home, or to convert the manufactured home to real property under statute, which the lender failed to do.

        The creditor did not have a security interest in the mobile home because the creditor had not complied with KRS Chapter 186A by surrendering a certificate of title to the county clerk and filing an affidavit stating that the mobile home had been converted to real estate. Because the creditor’s loan was thus not secured by real property that consisted of the debtor’s personal residence, the exception to modification afforded under 11 USCS § 1322(b)(2) did not apply.

        Because the plain language of the mortgage contract did not grant the lender a lien on debtor’s manufactured home as personal property, the lender did not obtain a security interest in the manufactured home through the mortgage contract, and even if the lender had obtained a lien against the manufactured home by way of the mortgage contract, it was undisputed that the lender did not note the security interest on the certificate of title, and the filing of a lis pendens could not serve to perfect a security interest in a manufactured home; accordingly, before the state-court foreclosure judgment, the lender did not have a perfected lien on debtor’s manufactured home.

      The General Assembly finds that purchasers when buying vehicles are entitled to know if the vehicle has sustained prior severe damage. The most feasible mechanism for conveying that information is a designation on the title that the vehicle has previously sustained severe damage or has been rebuilt after being declared “junk,” “salvage,” or “water damaged.”

        The bureau of vehicle registration has no recourse but to continue to act upon foreign judgments in accordance with the provisions of KRS 187.410(1) and may not enact a regulation requiring that any foreign judgment submitted to it be first filed in a Kentucky court and certified unsatisfied prior to performing the statutory duties under KRS 187.410(1) since such a regulation would be an attempt to confer jurisdiction on a circuit court by administrative regulation in violation of Ky. Const., § 126 (repealed) which provides that only the General Assembly may confer or change the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.

        Court may judicially notice that purpose of nonresident motorists law was to encourage greater care in operation of cars by nonresidents, and to give effective civil remedy against them comparable to that against residents.

        The fact that a nonresident motorist who comes into Kentucky can, consistent with the due process clause of the 14th amendment, be subjected to suit in the appropriate Kentucky state court has nothing whatever to do with his rights under 28 USCS § 1391(a) and service of process could not be made under this section by a nonresident against a nonresident in a federal court action for damages arising from an accident in Kentucky. Olberding v. Illinois C. R. Co., 346 U.S. 338, 74 S. Ct. 83, 98 L. Ed. 39, 1953 U.S. LEXIS 1549 (U.S. 1953).

        Where nonresident owner authorized other nonresident to use automobile, and other nonresident permitted her nephew to take and operate it, and he had accident in Kentucky, other nonresident could not be served pursuant to this section, not being owner of car and car not being operated by her agent.

        Although the estate served its initial complaint on the Secretary of State’s office, such service was subject to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 454.210(3)(c), under which an additional mailing to the nonresident defendant was required, implicating the provisions of the Hague Convention; thus, the estate was obligated to comply with the Hague Convention to effect complete service on the nonresident defendant, and since it did not, the trial court properly quashed the initial service of process on him.

        Nonresident motorists law authorizes commencement of action in county where accident occurred by substituted service of process, where both plaintiff and defendant are nonresidents and reside in some foreign state. Hoagland v. Dolan, 259

        ).

       <p>
        Action against nonresident for automobile collision could only be brought in county where collision occurred, under law requiring actions for injuries to persons or property to be brought in county where defendant resides or where injury is done. Kennedy v. Lee, 272
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. 237

       <p>
        Service of summons should be quashed as to nonresident motorist served pursuant to this section, where action was instituted in Circuit Court of county other than one where injury was done and process was issued by clerk of that court. Kennedy v. Lee, 272
        <cite class="ky_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        Where action against nonresident motorist was brought in county of plaintiff’s residence, instead of county where accident occurred, motion of defendant to quash process and to quash the return thereon sufficiently raised the question of venue, and justified dismissal of the action by the lower court, although basis for motion to quash was alleged irregularity in issuance and service of process.

        The Secretary of State need not actually succeed in notifying nonresident defendant, provided all details of the statute have been complied with, assuming plaintiff has stated in petition the correct address of defendant and is not guilty of fraud or bad faith. Morris v. Argo-Collier Truck Line, 39 F. Supp. 602, 1941 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3000 (D.
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. 1941

        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requiring Secretary of State to write letter to defendant “at the address given in the petition” was not invalid as not making it reasonably probable that notice of suit would be communicated to defendant, in view of plaintiff’s duty and interest to give correct address. Hirsch v. Warren, 253
        <cite class="ky_code">

        Service of summons on nonresident motorist should not be quashed where defect suggested was that copy of petition served was not stated to be attested; presumption that officers did duty by serving attested copy not being overcome by failure of sheriff’s return and of Secretary of State’s letter to state that copy was attested. Fischer v. Eby, 272
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. 545

       <p>
        Where court’s jurisdiction over person of nonresident motorist, who was the defendant in a damage suit, depended upon substituted service of process, failure of plaintiff’s petition to set out either the present or the last known address of the defendant resulted in failure to comply sufficiently with the law authorizing substituted service, and a personal judgment by default, rendered against the defendant, was void. Odley v. Wilson, 309

        In an action arising out of a traffic accident where two addresses, one in-state and one out-of-state, are given in the state police officer’s report, a plaintiff who seeks to invoke the provisions of this section is required to direct summons to the local address as well as to the out-of-state address.

        Even in the absence of a statute granting express exemption, a conservation officer may not be prosecuted criminally for a violation of subsection (1) of this section where the conduct of driving a short distance on a secondary highway without turning on the lights of his automobile was in the course of his official duties while attempting to apprehend suspected violators of the hunting laws and where due care was exercised for the safety of others.

        Where accident occurred on rainy and foggy night, and evidence was that defendant had “dimmed” his lights for better visibility, so that they cast their beams only 100 or 150 feet, an instruction that it was duty of defendant to have his automobile equipped with lights with sufficient power to distinguish objects for a distance of at least 350 feet was prejudicially erroneous, since jury should have been instructed to take into consideration the atmospheric conditions.

        It is customary and safe practice for driver on lighted street to have his headlights dimmed and to dim lights prior to passing another automobile and instruction to jury that driver had duty to have front headlights of sufficient power to reveal substantial objects 350 feet ahead as required by statute was properly refused where driver had dimmed his lights prior to passing an automobile and his failure to do so would have been a statutory violation.

        A coroner’s vehicle is not an “emergency vehicle” and it is not included among those types of vehicles which are authorized and required to utilize red or blue flashing, rotating or oscillating lights and sirens, bells or whistles; the coroner may not use such equipment on his vehicle even when he is proceeding to the scene of an accident.

     Flashing white or amber lights to warn of traffic hazard permitted.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provisions against the use of flashing lights, any vehicle may be equipped with lamps which may be used for the purpose of warning the operators of other vehicles of the presence of a vehicular traffic hazard requiring the exercise of unusual care in approaching, overtaking or passing and when so equipped may display such warning in addition to any other warning signals required by law. The lamps used to display such warning to the front shall be mounted at the same level and as widely spaced laterally as practicable, and shall display simultaneously flashing white or amber lights, or any shade of color between white and amber. The lamps used to display such warning to the rear shall be mounted at the same level and as widely spaced laterally as practicable, and shall show simultaneously flashing amber or red lights, or any shade of color between amber and red. These warning lights shall be visible from a distance of not less than fifteen hundred (1,500) feet under normal atmospheric conditions at night.

        Motorist was not guilty of voluntary manslaughter by recklessly driving overtaking automobile against pedestrian where there was evidence that he saw pedestrian when 1,000 feet away, that she looked toward car and then walked along side of highway, but, as he reached her, turned and walked in front of car, notwithstanding he gave no warning signal.

        In nighttime collision between truck and pedestrian, sounding of horn by driver going about 25 miles per hour when 300 yards from pedestrian to warn another pedestrian and not again until within 15 to 25 feet was insufficient, since it did not afford pedestrian opportunity to escape.

        In action for striking pedestrian crossing country highway, instructions should have defined driver’s duty to signal approach of truck, where, although there was evidence that driver did not see pedestrian until instant of collision, there was also evidence that he could have seen him when 55 feet away.

        Where bus driver, on coming over rise 500 feet from point where car was parked, sounded his horn and slowed his speed to about 25 miles per hour, but did not sound horn again until he was within 15 or 20 feet of parked car, second sounding of horn was not sufficient to warn person who was standing beside parked car, and it was a jury question as to whether bus driver used proper diligence in approaching the parked car.

        Since the duty to sound a horn depends upon the necessity of the occasion, which is ordinarily a question for the jury, the absence of evidence as to whether the horn was sounded or not sounded or the necessity thereof under the circumstances did not authorize a peremptory instruction upon the ground of contributory negligence.

        Where plaintiff was struck by defendant’s fire truck in an intersection through which the automatic traffic signal showed her to have the right of way, she had one witness who testified that the fire truck was not sounding a siren or other audible warning, and she introduced other witnesses who testified that they did not hear any warning from the truck, the issue was properly submitted to the jury although the defendant introduced several witnesses who testified that the siren was working properly immediately prior to the collision.

        When an emergency vehicle driver has the preferred right of way, he must be exceptionally alert when he intends to run a red traffic light at a busy street intersection and must take care commensurate with the serious consequences that might follow his failure to do so; he should remember that other drivers have the right to assume that the red light signal will be obeyed by him unless duly and timely warned to the contrary.

        Notice and warning to persons required to yield the right of way is essential, and a reasonable opportunity to yield or get out of the way is necessary before they become chargeable with the obligation to give preference to the emergency vehicle. Page v. Dodds, 433 S.W.2d 656, 1968

        Where a police cruiser intended not only to run a red light, but to use an extraordinary path in reaching the intersection, it might reasonably be considered that a warning which merely signified that an emergency vehicle was approaching was not adequate to give notice of the extraordinary course the vehicle would pursue.

        Instruction to find for plaintiff if jury believed that defendant knew of defective brakes on his truck and with such knowledge operated the truck on the occasion in question with such defective brakes, “if any,” although subject to criticism because it could be construed as assuming that the brakes were defective, was not prejudicial, in view of use of words “if any” and in view of testimony of driver of truck that brakes were defective.

        Defendant’s motion to dismiss should have been granted after defendant was charged with driving under the influence and driving without a seatbelt because the basis for defendant’s arrest was premised upon a highway checkpoint and the checkpoint did not comport with state police guidelines. There were no media announcements about the check point, a state trooper was not designated to be in charge of the checkpoint, the checkpoint was closed after defendant was arrested, and the state police could not put forth a constitutionally permissible purpose for its decision to conduct the vehicle checkpoint.

        Instructions were not so prejudicial as to require a reversal where court used term “lookout” rather than “ordinary care” to learn of the presence of a closely following vehicle.

Although a citizen generally may not be qualified to determine the weight of a vehicle by mere observation, nevertheless he is capable of determining whether the truck is constructed so as to contain properly its contents (as required by this section) or whether the operator of the truck is guilty of littering the highways (thus offending KRS

        The fiscal court, in determining whether to make an appropriation for purchase of scales to weigh trucks for use by the sheriff’s office, could weigh such need against funds available, reasonable enforcement priorities, availability of outside resources, and other considerations; a fiscal court is under a strict duty to ensure that essential obligations are provided for before making appropriations for those things that, while allowable, are not compulsory or indispensable.

        Under subsection (1)(c) of this section, the maximum legal weight, including vehicle and load, which can be carried on a truck having three rear axles spaced 51 inches apart is 50,000 pounds, of which not more than 18,000 pounds can be carried on the front axle or any single axle in the tandem arrangement, and not more than 32,000 pounds can be carried on the three axles making up the single rear tandem.

        Where the legislature specifically excluded from the axle weight provisions vehicles engaged exclusively in the transportation of farm products only, the Kentucky State Police cannot enforce axle weight provisions against such vehicles because of subsection (3) of this section, despite the fact that the Federal Highway Administration indicated that the exclusion contained in subsection (3) would jeopardize federal aid funds, in that the failure to enforce axle weight limits on federal aid roads in the state without regard to the use or licensing of the vehicle would violate federal law, since the will and intent of the legislature must control and since the legislative intent is explicitly and unambiguously expressed in the exemption for farm vehicles.

        In connection with truck axles the language of subdivision (7)(b) (now (9)(b)) of this section refers to a “tridem axle” and since the Interstate Highway System is a part of the “federal aid highway system” referred to in subsection (7) (now (9)) of this section it follows that the maximum allowable weight for tridem axles used on the Interstate Highway System in Kentucky is 48,000 pounds.

      A city of the fourth class does not have the authority under KRS 86.110(11) (now repealed) to impose weight limits on a state highway if the commissioner of highways (now secretary of transportation) has assumed responsibility under this section for regulating traffic on the state maintained highways running through the city.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of laws, the Transportation Cabinet may issue special permits to the owners, operators, or lessees of motor vehicles for the purpose of hauling industrial materials whose gross weight or dimensions, including vehicle and load, exceeds the limits prescribed by this chapter or which in other respects fail to comply with the requirements of this chapter. A separate permit shall be required for each vehicle. Such permits shall be issued for specified materials only and shall designate the portions of the state primary road system over which such vehicle may operate pursuant to the permit. Such permit shall be issued for a stated period of time determined by the applicant not to exceed three (3) years, and an existing permit may be renewed pending an inspection by the cabinet of the routes listed on the permit. Permits under this section shall be upon such terms and conditions as the cabinet may, in its discretion, require in the public interest.

       The cabinet shall require, as a condition to the issuance of the permit, that the applicant pay a reasonable fee, to be fixed by the cabinet, and shall require that an applicant convicted under provisions of KRS 189.990(2)(a) two (2) or more times within a five (5) year period give bond, with approved surety, in an amount not to exceed six thousand dollars ($6,000) for each vehicle to indemnify the Commonwealth of Kentucky against damage to highways or bridges resulting from the operation of any motor vehicle under the authorization of such permit. A bond acquired under this subsection may be carried forward to another permit if the cabinet has not gone against the bond.

        It is not contributory negligence as a matter of law for one in full possession of his faculties to ride on the running board of a motor vehicle, but an intoxicated person who so rides is guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. If the driver does not know of the intoxicated condition, the passenger may not recover for injuries, but if the driver knows of the condition he must, under the last clear chance doctrine, exercise ordinary care to prevent injury to the passenger, having in mind his intoxicated condition, and in some cases ordinary care would require that the vehicle not be operated at all with the passenger on the running board.

        Where a school bus driver stopped in his left lane a few feet behind a commercial bus which was stopped partially in the right lane and he could easily have pulled completely off of the road, the question of whether the school bus driver was negligent should have been submitted to the jury and, were it not for the requirement that all motorists stop before passing a school bus and the possibility that the school bus driver, therefore, reasonably thought that any motorist behind him would be prepared to stop when he did, there should have been a directed verdict against the school bus driver in favor of a passenger in a car which hit both buses from behind on the slick road.

        Where a commercial bus stopped partially in the right traffic lane of a road in order to repair a flat tire, a school bus traveling in the same direction then stopped in the left lane a few feet behind it, and a car also traveling in the same direction then hit both buses in an attempt to stop on the slick road, the parking of the school bus so as to materially obstruct the road was so unusual and extraordinary that the commercial bus driver could not have foreseen it and, therefore, the parking of the school bus was an intervening cause of the accident so as to relieve the commercial bus driver of liability even if his stopping was negligent.

        Where evidence showed that front wheels of defendant’s car were across center line of highway, but rear wheels were on defendant’s right side of highway, such evidence was strong support of defendant’s testimony that plaintiff’s car struck defendant’s car on left side of highway and bumpers caught, pulling front of defendant’s car across the center line.

        Where the defendant, before beginning to pass a slowing truck, failed to look in his rearview mirror to see that the southbound lane was clear of other traffic, both fore and aft, thus forcing a car off the road that had already begun to pass him, regardless of whether that driver had sounded his horn, the evidence was sufficient to justify a finding that the defendant was negligent.

        Where defendant, driving west on highway, started to turn across road into filling station in front of plaintiff’s car, which was going east, but changed his mind and turned back to own side of road because of proximity of plaintiff’s car, and collision resulted because plaintiff turned to left in effort to avoid defendant’s car, questions of negligence and contributory negligence were for the jury, in view of testimony and physical evidence that plaintiff was driving at high rate of speed and did not reduce his speed although he saw defendant preparing to turn when defendant was some 400 feet away.

        If driver making a left turn had started across the highway when the automobile with which he collided was still 180 feet to his north as he testified, he did not violate this section per se and the question of contributory negligence was for the jury but assuming he failed to signal a left turn in violation of statute the question of proximate cause was for the jury so trial court did not err in allowing a jury to pass on the questions of negligence and proximate cause.

        Where a collision occurs on the defendant’s left side of the road, if the explanation is so clear and convincing and all the circumstances and fair inferences that could be drawn from them show that the reason for being on the wrong side of the road was completely unrelated to any negligence of the defendant, then the defendant is entitled to win by directed verdict, but, if the reasons, circumstances or the inferences are not that clear then the jury must determine the question.

        Since reckless driving, failure to have a driver’s license, speeding and crossing the yellow line are four separate offenses, where a chase commences in a city and ends in the county with both city and county and/or state officials involved in apprehending the violator, double jeopardy would not prohibit the county from charging the accused with speeding and crossing the yellow line even though the city has already charged him with reckless driving and failure to have a driver’s license.

        When two vehicles moving in opposite directions are approaching a bridge or passage too narrow for the vehicles to pass, it is the duty of each operator to exercise ordinary care to prevent collision and in so doing to avoid the contingency of being on the bridge or in the passage at the same time.

        Where, regardless of estimates and the exercise of reasonable judgment by either driver, one of them as a matter of fact has practically or actually driven on a narrow bridge before the other, it becomes the duty of the latter to stop until the former has crossed over and cleared the way.

        In determining which of two vehicles approaching a one-way bridge has the right-of-way, the determining factor is which vehicle proceeding within the law as to speed could be reasonably expected, in the exercise of reasonable care, to reach the bridge first. Short v. Robinson, 280

        In approaching a one-way bridge, the driver of the motor vehicle who would probably first reach and enter it by proceeding at a reasonable rate of speed, and exercising ordinary care considering the situation before him, has the right-of-way; it is the duty of the driver not having the right-of-way not to enter the bridge but to drive his car to the right of the middle of the road and wait for the other car to clear the bridge; and it is the duty of the driver of the car having the right-of-way immediately on leaving the bridge to drive to his right-hand side of the middle of the road.

        Evidence that motorist approaching horse and buggy on city street did not stop car but turned it and attempted to pass between restive horse and sidewalk justified jury’s verdict against him. Webb v. Moore, 136

      <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol11">
       When two (2) vehicles approach or enter an intersection from different roadways at approximately the same time, the operator of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the right.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol12">
       The right-of-way rule declared in subsection (1) is modified at highways and through intersections and as otherwise stated in this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol13">
       Preferential right-of-way may be indicated by stop signs or yield signs. The state highway commissioner, with reference to state highways, and local authorities, with reference to other highways under their jurisdiction, may designate any intersection as a stop intersection or as a yield intersection and erect stop signs or yield signs at one (1) or more entrances to such intersections.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol14">
       Except when directed to proceed by a police officer, every operator of a vehicle approaching a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the operator has view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it. After having stopped, the operator shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when such operator is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol15">
       The operator of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall, in obedience to such sign, slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and, if required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line but, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the operator has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it. After slowing and stopping, the operator shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such operator is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways; provided, however, that if such an operator is involved in a collision with a vehicle in the intersection or junction of roadways after driving past a yield sign without stopping, such collision shall be deemed prima facie evidence of his failure to yield right-of-way.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol16">
       The operator of a vehicle intending to turn shall do so as follows:

        <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol16a">
         Right turns — both the approach for a right turn and a right turn shall be made as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway;
        </li>
        <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol16b">
         Left turns — the operator of a vehicle intending to turn left shall approach the turn in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle. Whenever practicable, the left turn shall be made to the left of the center of the intersection and so as to leave the intersection or other location in the extreme right-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the same direction as such vehicle on the roadway being entered.
        </li>

      </li>
      <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol17">
       The Transportation Cabinet and local authorities in their respective jurisdictions may cause official traffic control devices to be placed and thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in this section be traveled by turning vehicles and, when such devices are so placed, no operator shall turn a vehicle other than as directed and required by such devices.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol18">
       The operator of any vehicle shall not turn such vehicle so as to proceed in the opposite direction unless such movement can be made in safety without interfering with other traffic.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol19">
       The operator of a vehicle intending to turn to the left within an intersection or into an alley, private road, or driveway shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close thereto as to constitute an immediate hazard.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVIc189s189.330ol110">
       The operator of a vehicle about to enter or cross a roadway from any place other than another roadway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on the roadway to be entered or crossed.
      </li>

        In action for damages resulting from collision of car and truck where truck traveling in southbound right lane collided with car traveling in southbound left lane that was attempting to pass truck, trial court correctly refused to give instruction under subsection (2) (now (1)) of this section to the effect that car should have yielded right-of-way to truck which was approaching from the right since the accident did not occur in an intersection.

        In a death action arising out of a collision, an instruction which required a vehicle to yield the right-of-way “at the intersection of its path with the path of another vehicle approaching from the right unless the vehicle approaching from the right is farther from the point of the intersection of the paths of the two automobiles than such first named vehicle,” instead of an instruction requiring a vehicle to yield the right-of-way at an intersection to another vehicle approaching from the right unless the vehicle approaching from the right is farther from the intersection, was sufficient since the former instruction is in the language of subsection (2) (now (1)) of this section.

        The court properly instructed the jury that under this section it was the plaintiff’s duty to yield the right-of-way to the defendant (since she was approaching from the right) unless the jury should believe that the defendant’s car was farther from the point of the intersection of the respective paths of the cars than was the plaintiff’s car, and that in such an event it was the defendant’s duty to yield the right-of-way through the intersection.

        Where turn to the left was necessarily subsequent to the determination of which of two vehicles had the right-of-way at the intersection jury would have to make that determination under an instruction based on subsection (2) (now (1)) of this section and it was error for court to give instruction under subsection (1) (now (6)(b)) of this section (to the effect that automobile driver entering through street had the duty to see to it that he had sufficient space and time before entering the intersection to bear to the left in order to proceed eastwardly) apparently assuming that the proper law to apply was the provision giving the right-of-way to the vehicle proceeding in a straight line and not the first at the intersection when the first at the intersection was going to make a left turn.

        Motorist was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law under subsection (5) (now (4)) of this section when he drove onto a main highway from a side street where there was a stop sign without stopping when a heavily loaded truck, signalling a right turn into the highway, was approaching the intersection at about 40 miles per hour although the truck drove straight ahead instead of turning right.

        Where the defendant did not see the plaintiff’s vehicle, but drove his automobile into an intersection when the plaintiff’s vehicle was so close as to constitute an immediate hazard, the defendant was guilty of contributory negligence which precluded his recovery on a counterclaim, since he was required by law to see what he should have seen by looking.

        Motorist’s contributory negligence was proximate cause of accident where in violation of subsection (5) (now (4)) of this section he failed to stop and yield right-of-way to truck traveling on arterial highway when the truck was so near intersection as to constitute an immediate hazard and the fact his automobile was found in second gear tended to corroborate evidence of his failure to stop and yield right-of-way.

        Where the evidence indicated that defendant stopped her car at a stop sign, saw a pickup truck turning right into lane closest to her and pulled into the intersection as the truck was turning thereby striking a motorcycle obscured from her vision by the turning truck, and killing the motorcyclist, it was proper for the court to direct a verdict against the defendant pursuant to this section.

        A superior street or thoroughfare does not lose its superior status by reason of a stop or yield sign being misplaced or obscured on an inferior, intersecting street; the policy underlying such a rule is that a motorist proceeding along a through street or highway protected by stop signs is entitled to assume that the driver of the vehicle on an intersecting street will obey the law and stop or yield the right-of-way.

        The operator of a motor scooter who re-entered the highway from a service station was under a duty to look for approaching vehicles and not to proceed upon the highway if he saw one coming, unless he could do so in safety, and while he was not required to exercise an infallible judgment he was required to use such care as a reasonably cautious and prudent person would exercise under the circumstances.

        The matter of who had the right-of-way was relative notwithstanding the literal language of subsection (7) (now (10)) of this section and the question of negligence was for the jury, however, on second appeal the “law of the case” precluded reconsideration of the claimed error that the section was mandatory in requiring driver to yield right-of-way.

        Instruction that it was the further duty of driver as he approached road to yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching on the highway and not to proceed from private driveway into the road until he could do so with reasonable safety to traffic on the highway was in keeping with subsection (6) (now (10)) of this section and where evidence was conflicting question of whether accident was result of motorist entering highway from driveway or of high rate of speed of vehicle approaching on highway was question for jury.

        Where instruction offered and one given by the court imposed practically the same duties on the driver with the exception that the offered instruction required defendant’s driver to come to a dead stop before entering the highway this difference was immaterial because all testimony showed defendant’s driver made a complete stop before emerging from the private driveway onto the highway and plaintiff could not complain of the instruction.

        The duty to yield right-of-way under subsection (7) (now (10)) of this section implies the duty to look and see what is obvious unless there is some excuse for not seeing it and where driver pulling onto highway and both of her passengers looked but no automobile was visible the court was correct in submitting the question to the jury with instructions including a contributory negligence instruction and the jury was justified in believing that had the lights of the car approaching on the highway been on, the driver pulling onto the highway and her passengers would have seen it.

        In a collision case between motorist and motorcyclist where the act creating the peril occurred almost simultaneously with the happening of the collision, the last clear chance doctrine was not applicable because neither party could fairly be said to have a last clear chance to avert the consequences, and thus the refusal of the trial court to instruct on the last clear chance doctrine was not error.

     Authority to install yield right-of-way signs.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When it is determined, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation at an intersection, that vehicle stop signs are more restrictive than necessary for the safe and efficient control of that intersection’s vehicular movements, yield right-of-way signs may be installed by the Department of Highways on one or more of the intersection approaches for the purpose of assigning right-of-way. The driver of a vehicle, in obedience to a yield right-of-way sign shall yield right-of-way to vehicles not so obligated to yield or stop which are within the intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard; but such driver, having so yielded, may proceed at such time as a safe interval occurs.

       Since subsection (3) of this section states that all traffic control devices must conform to the provisions of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, the legislature obviously intended that no traffic control device be installed which does not conform to Manual specifications and that no device be installed where there are no specifications set forth in the Manual to which it could conform; therefore, since the Manual makes no reference to speed bumps there is no statutory or regulatory authority for their placement or installation.

        Where taxicab was passing a bicycle traveling in the same direction as they went through an intersection and another motorist operated her automobile into the intersection and into the left side of the taxicab in violation of posted stop signs causing the cab to strike the bicycle throwing the rider off and killing him, the trial court did not err in refusing to give instructions as to the duties of the operator of a vehicle in overtaking and passing another vehicle, because it is doubtful whether these rules apply to bicycles and, even if they do, the passing by the taxicab was not the proximate cause of the rider’s death.

        If a witness (whether interested or disinterested) was in a position in which it is likely that he would have heard and noticed a warning signal, and he did not hear it, there is a reasonable basis for the jury to infer that the signal was not given, particularly when the witnesses testifying that it was given are interested and evidence is sufficient to support a finding that it was not sounded and where the failure to sound was defendant’s he is not entitled to a directed verdict.

        While operators of motorcycles and bicycles have the same duty to sound their horns in passing another vehicle as is required of operators of automobiles and other motor vehicles, defendant was under no duty to sound his horn for the benefit of persons whom he knew had recently crested a hill and was under no duty to anticipate that bicyclist would stop or slow down to a walk after cresting the hill.

        Where a motorist turned left in front of another motorist trying to pass him from the rear resulting in a collision, the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the passing motorist could fulfill his duty under this section by notice other than sounding his horn such as by signalling with his lights, but this was not reversible error, because the evidence, that the turning motorist’s failure to signal for the required distance before turning was the proximate cause of the accident, was sufficient to sustain the verdict for the passing motorist.

        Even if it be assumed that automobile was partially to right of centerline that would not have been negligence per se under KRS 189.340(1) since subsection (1) of this section requires the operator of the vehicle being overtaken to “give way to the right” insofar as he is reasonably able to do so and subsection (2) of this section exacts from the operators and occupants of both vehicles the duty of such reciprocal assistance “as the circumstances reasonably demand” and to make the center line of the highway an absolute criterion would destroy the effect of these provisions.

        The requirement that driver about to be overtaken must give way and cooperate as the circumstances reasonably demand are literally predicated upon receipt of the audible signal required by KRS 189.340(1), but presumably they would apply also if in some other manner the driver being overtaken is or should be aware of the move to pass.

        Where the defendant, before beginning to pass a slowing truck, failed to look in his rearview mirror to see that the southbound lane was clear of other traffic, both before and after, thus forcing a car off the road that had already begun to pass him, regardless of whether that driver had sounded his horn, the evidence was sufficient to justify a finding that the defendant was negligent.

        When a school bus driver has seen a vehicle pass a stopped school bus loading or unloading children, has noted the license number of the vehicle, and has ascertained the name of the registered owner, he has sufficient information to justify making a complaint before a judge against the registered owner and the complaint should not be dismissed without a trial, but unless the prosecution has obtained additional evidence, either direct or circumstantial, identifying the driver of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the court would be justified in dismissing the case without requiring the defendant to make any defense.

      No school or church bus shall be licensed or operated for the transportation of school children unless it is equipped with bus alternating flashing signal lamps and a stop arm folding sign. The bus body shall be equipped with a system of four (4) red signal lamps, two (2) on the front and two (2) on the rear of the bus, and four (4) amber signal lamps. Each amber signal lamp shall be located near each red signal lamp, at the same level, but closer to the vertical centerline of the bus. The bus body shall be equipped with a stop arm folding sign on the driver’s side with letters at least six (6) inches in height displaying the word “stop” on both sides. Prior to stopping the school bus for the purpose of receiving or discharging school children, the driver shall activate the amber flashing signal lamps. Once the bus comes to a complete stop, the driver shall extend the stop arm and activate the red flashing signal lights prior to opening the door so it shall be plainly visible to traffic approaching from both directions that the bus is in the process of receiving or discharging passengers. No driver shall stop a school or church bus for receiving or discharging passengers in a no passing zone which does not afford reasonable visibility to approaching motor vehicles from both directions unless a “School Bus Stop Ahead” sign has been installed a reasonable distance before that spot in the roadway. No driver shall stop a school or church bus for the purpose of receiving passengers from or discharging passengers to the opposite side of the road on a highway of four (4) or more lanes; provided, that this provision does not prohibit the discharging of passengers at a marked pedestrian crossing.

        While a vehicle proceeding in a straight course should be given priority, the plaintiff, as he approached the highway junction intending to follow a straight course, had a duty to keep his automobile under reasonable control, to drive at a reasonable speed, to maintain a lookout for other automobiles and signals and to exercise ordinary care to avoid a collision with a vehicle turning at the junction. Moskowitz v. Peariso, 458 F.2d 240, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 10221 (6th Cir.
        <cite class="ky_code">

        A motorist following another motorist at a distance of about 25 feet at a speed of 20 to 25 miles per hour had a reasonable right to assume that the preceding motorist would, in the event the latter decided to stop or turn, observe his duty under this section to properly indicate his intention. Berry v. Jorris, 303

        Subsection (1) of this section imposes a double duty on a driver who wants to change the direction of his vehicle. He must first ascertain that his movement can be made with reasonable safety and then he must give a signal to drivers of other vehicles of his intention to change direction. Kentucky Bus Lines, Inc. v. Wilson, 258 S.W.2d 486, 1953
        <cite class="ky_code">

       <p>
        Once a driver had signaled a left turn and then changed his mind and swerved back on to his right side of the road and stopped or slowed almost to a stop, it was necessary that he make known his change of intention in compliance with this section. McCoy v. Carter, 323 S.W.2d 210, 1959
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 323

        An instruction that the plaintiff driver should have his motor vehicle under reasonable control and should keep a reasonable lookout ahead, although irrelevant because negligence claim was predicated on violation of other statutory duties, was not error.

        Drivers have a duty to maintain a lookout ahead and to the rear in attempting to change from the left to the right lane of traffic and it is up to the jury to determine whether a driver was acting in a reasonably prudent manner when he looked in his rearview mirror rather than looking out ahead immediately before a collision.

        Although he has signaled his intention to make a left turn, a motorist may make such a turn only when it may be done in reasonable safety, thus where a motorist so signaled then turned in front of a truck which hit his car and then ran into a building damaging both vehicles, the building, and injuring an occupant of the building and the only negligence alleged against the truck driver was his failure to steer around the motorist, the trial court erred in not directing the verdict in favor of the truck driver and owner as against the motorist and other injured parties.

        In action for injuries arising out of a motor vehicular accident allegedly caused by the defendant operating his car from the berm of a highway into the path of the plaintiff’s car causing the plaintiff to lose control, the trial court erred in directing the verdict against the defendant where he testified that he was 700 feet in front of the plaintiff’s car when he pulled onto the traveled portion of the highway and the driver of the plaintiff’s car admitted seeing defendant’s car by the road and that she knew that he would drive back onto the road after he picked up a passenger.

        This statute does not fix any speed limit other than to make it unlawful to drive at speed greater than is reasonable having regard to traffic conditions, but it does provide that speed exceeding stated rate in residential section of city shall be prima facie evidence of improper driving, thus imposing upon one driving at excessive speed, burden of proving that such speed did not produce the injury.

        Where accident resulted from blowout of tire, and there was evidence that car was being driven in excess of 45 miles per hour at the time, an instruction requiring jury to find for defendant if they believed that accident resulted from defect in tire unknown to defendant was erroneous, since it excused defendant from liability regardless of the rate of speed at which he was driving, it being common knowledge that the rate of speed affects the course a motor vehicle may take after a blowout.

        Where the only direct evidence of speed was plaintiff
        ’s own testimony that he was traveling within the speed limit and there was no circumstantial evidence of substance to indicate a greater speed, an instruction on the point was unnecessary and technically improper but the enumeration of a driver’s basic duties in a single instruction does not emphasize any one of them over the others and does not so invite speculation that prejudice could be found in the inclusion of a duty just because it is technically irrelevant and from a practical standpoint, it would seem that when there had been no evidence of excessive speed there would be a greater likelihood of benefit than prejudice to the driver through the jury’s being advised of the speed limit.

        This section authorized jury instructions in a vehicular personal injury action stating that the plaintiff had a duty not to drive her car so slowly as to block or impede the normal movement of other traffic, and that if she was aware that the defendant’s truck was passing her car she should have assisted it to obtain clearance; the instructions were justified by the defendant’s testimony that he first saw the plaintiff’s car “rocking back and forth” in front of him and by the plaintiff’s testimony that she was aware the defendant was trying to pass her. The section applies to all public roadways, including interstate highways. Burns v. Level, 957 S.W.2d 218, 1997

        It is negligence per se to turn a vehicle around on a highway near the crest of a grade unless it can be seen for 500 feet by driver approaching from either direction but this section contemplates normal conditions and when collision results from a supervening, abnormal circumstance such as brake failure by oncoming truck the violation is not the proximate cause of the collision.

        Unpublished decision:
    Statute did not impose a duty upon a car salesman to remove the ignition key from the unattended vehicle parked in his apartment parking lot because the statute did not apply to a private driveway; an apartment complex parking lot is owned by the property owner and, depending on the lease agreement, permitted to be used by the residents and guests, and thus, it is analogous to a private driveway and is not a public way used by motorists to travel from one point to another.

        Although this section related to stopping of motor vehicles to make repairs or for passengers, its purpose was to prevent a person from leaving a motor vehicle standing on a main traveled portion of a public highway. Bradley v. Clarke, 219
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. 438

        Apparently this section relates to the stopping of a motor vehicle for the purpose of making repairs or taking on or discharging passengers, but the purpose of the statute undoubtedly was to prevent any person from stopping a motor vehicle and leaving it standing on a main traveled portion of any public highway. Hendricks v. Garst, 314

        Purpose of this section was to prevent any person from stopping a motor vehicle and leaving it standing on main traveled portion of a highway and one who parks his car in such a position has burden of showing that he is within the exceptions stated in the statute. Bosshammer v. Lawton, 237 S.W.2d 520, 1951

        The purpose of this section is to prevent the highway from being obstructed by stationary vehicles, and one leaving a vehicle standing on the highway has the burden of showing that he comes within one of the exceptions enumerated therein. Banner Transfer Co. v. Morse, 274 S.W.2d 380, 1954

In addition, any agency or organization which transports persons with a disability as a part of the service provided by that agency or organization shall receive an accessible parking placard upon application to the county clerk for each vehicle used in the transportation of persons with a disability. The accessible parking placard issued shall be a two (2) sided hanger style placard and shall on each side bear the international symbol of access adopted by Rehabilitation International in 1969. One (1) side of the placard shall bear the date of expiration of the placard, a seal or other identification of the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, and shall contain the accessible parking placard identification number and other information the Transportation Cabinet may by regulation require. The international symbol of access shall be at least three (3) inches in height, be centered on the placard and in a white color on a blue shield. Any information contained on the placard shall be written in indelible ink or inscribed in other permanent fashion so as to prevent tampering with or the changing of information contained on the placard.

The placard shall be valid for a period of six (6) years and may be renewed an unlimited number of times. A placard shall expire in the applicant’s birth month and may be renewed up to twelve (12) months prior to its expiration date. Upon renewal, a receipt and decal shall be issued that both contain the placard number, placard expiration date, and other information required by the Transportation Cabinet. The decal shall be affixed to the existing placard. Placards shall be printed at cabinet expense. The county clerk of each county shall keep a record of applications filed and placards issued.

K. and driver without making the boulevard stop proceeded across the intersection and his car was struck on the right side by another car who had an equal opportunity to avoid the accident, the last clear chance doctrine did not apply and the contributory negligence of the guest precluded recovery from either the driver of the automobile in which he was riding or the driver of the other car involved in the collision.

        Defendant’s turning away from a sobriety checkpoint, coupled with the deputy sheriff’s experience in similar instances, the time of day, and the nature of the roadway onto which the defendant turned constituted specific, reasonable, and articulable facts which allowed the police officer to draw an inference sufficient to form a reasonable suspicion that the defendant might have been engaged in criminal activity.

        Where accused refused to take a blood test which is the only “sobriety” test available in this state, her request for a “sobriety test” could not be granted. Sharp v. Commonwealth, 414 S.W.2d 902, 1967

       <p>
        Where the defendant contended that the question of whether he consented to the blood test should have been submitted to the jury but he made no such suggestion during the trial and made no motion for a new trial, the point was not reviewable on appeal. Washburn v. Commonwealth, 433 S.W.2d 859, 1968

        Where following an automobile accident the defendant was treated at the hospital for injuries and the investigating officer had no suspicion that the defendant had been drinking until he smelled a faint odor of alcohol while the defendant was being treated, there was not sufficient cause to warrant taking a blood test without consent.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where following an accident the sheriff went to the defendant’s hospital room and asked for consent to have a blood sample taken and the defendant agreed and the doctor testified the defendant, although in pain, was lucid and capable of giving a competent consent, the consent was valid although the defendant later claimed he could not remember giving the consent. Washburn v. Commonwealth, 433 S.W.2d 859, 1968

         Ky. LEXIS 295

       </p>
       <p>
        The accused does not have to have previously been informed of his right to refuse or of his right to counsel in order for a consent to have a blood sample taken to be valid. Washburn v. Commonwealth, 433 S.W.2d 859, 1968

        The provision for the manner of taking the blood test was intended for the safety and protection of the person being subjected to the test and does not apply to a dead body. Woosley v. Central Uniform Rental, 463 S.W.2d 345, 1971

        It was well within the province of the jury to conclude that a 19-year-old man who weighed 195 pounds and who was presumptively under the influence of intoxicating beverages at 12:46 a.m. on Saturday was likewise under the influence when he drove his vehicle off the road at 11:15 p.m. on Friday; there can be no doubt at all of the existence of a rational connection between the established fact of a 0.14 blood alcohol concentration “at the time of making an analysis,” and the presumed fact of being under the influence of alcohol at that time.

        It was error to instruct the jury in a murder prosecution involving a death caused by an allegedly intoxicated driver, on the statutory presumption that applies only to Driving Under the Influence (D.U.I.) cases, however, it was harmless error; the so-called legislative substitute should not have been utilized, but it was merely cumulative of other highly persuasive expert testimony to the same effect, so the harmless error rule applied.

        Where the only jury instruction referring specifically to subsections (3) and (4) of this section was the instruction to consider the subsections “as evidence in the case,” there was no reason to suppose that the jurors failed to understand that they, not the legislature, were the sole judges of the weight of that evidence; it is true that this piece of evidence was couched in mandatory language — it “shall” be presumed — but the mandate given the jury by the court was to treat the presumption as a matter of evidence and the section showed, moreover, that the presumption was intended to be rebuttable; otherwise, there would have been no reason to authorize “the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating beverages.” Morgan v.

The suspect has the right to have his own test administered by his own physician in addition to the one conducted at the request of the arresting officer; it is only when a motorist refuses to submit to a test requested by a police officer that he has no right to have tests administered by a physician of his own choosing.

        While police officers of a sixth class city have a statutory obligation to rigidly enforce the provisions of this section, they can only enforce this statute or any other statute within their jurisdictional area of authority; generally, the jurisdiction of such police officers to arrest for offenses against the state is limited to the city limits of their particular city. However, where sixth class cities are operating under an interlocal agreement, the jurisdiction is extended to include the city limits of all of the cities which are parties to the agreement; also under the appropriate circumstances the jurisdiction of a sixth class city police officer could be expanded by the utilization of the concept of hot pursuit under KRS

        A police officer cannot stop a driver suspected of being under the influence of alcohol, pursuant to this section, and take that individual to the police station for a breathalyzer test before arresting the individual and charging him or her with that offense, because KRS 186.565(1) (now repealed) clearly requires an arrest before the state can imply consent to a chemical test on the part of the driver.

        Former subsection (6) of this section was unequivocal and unambiguous: no person may be compelled to submit to a chemical test for the detection of alcohol in his blood. This section would be applicable to the taking of chemical tests for use as evidence in a prosecution for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages; if this section is applicable, then consent to the taking of the test is required. Where this section is not applicable, then under Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 86 S. Ct. 1826, 16 L. Ed. 2d 908, 1966 U.S. LEXIS 1129 (1968), consent is required under the federal constitution unless there exists reasonable cause for belief that the suspect is intoxicated.

        A reading of this section reveals that evidence of a breathalyzer or other chemical tests is not a necessary element of a prosecution for drunk driving; subsection (4) (now (3)) merely provides that if a blood-alcohol test is administered, the amount of alcohol found in the person’s blood shall give rise to certain presumptions. Thus, it is obvious that a prosecution can be maintained without the results of a breathalyzer test.

      Operators of all buses and motor vehicles used for transporting children shall stop their vehicles before crossing any railroad when tracks are at the same level of the roadway. The stop shall be made not less than fifteen (15) feet nor more than fifty (50) feet from the nearest track over which the highway crosses, except where the crossing is protected by gates or a flagman employed by the railroad. After making the stop, the operator shall open the service door and carefully look in each direction and listen for approaching trains or other on-track equipment before proceeding. If visibility is impaired at the required distance for stopping under this section, the operator may allow the vehicle to slowly roll forward for the purpose of gaining the visibility necessary to safely cross the railroad tracks.

        The fact that electric crossing signals are not working does not relieve the motorist of the duty to exercise ordinary care for his safety, but it does diminish the quantum of care considered as ordinary. Chesapeake &amp; O. R. Co. v. Pittman, 292

       <p>
        Refusal of court to instruct that if plaintiff relied exclusively on failure of electric signals to work without using ordinary care for his own safety then he was guilty of contributory negligence, was not error, since it is for jury to determine whether motorist, in proceeding across crossing where signals were not working, was using ordinary care under the circumstances in relying on the failure of the signals.

        Where train approaching crossing was in a cut for some distance, and motorist on highway could not see train until reaching a point on the highway only 75 to 80 feet from the crossing, and then only when the engine was within 40 or 50 feet of the crossing, and there was evidence that whistle and bell were not sounded until train was within 300 feet of the crossing and that wigwag signal was not working, motorist approaching crossing at 35 miles per hour was not negligent as a matter of law in failing to reduce speed or in failing to observe approach of train until too late to avoid being struck.

        An exception to this rule exists where there has been a custom of the railroad to maintain a light, signal or flagman at the crossing, and the custom is certain, definite, uniform, and known to travelers on the highway. Whether such custom existed is usually a jury question. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Maxwell, 292

        Where only evidence as to custom of railroad to maintain a flagman and lights at a crossing was that such was the practice during switching operations, the evidence was not sufficient to establish liability of railroad where a full train was standing on the crossing and no switching was being done.

        Applicability of the “ultra-hazardous-crossing” exception to defendant railroad’s minimal liability for a collision at a crossing on a private drive was an issue for the jury. The presence of a crossbuck sign did not absolve the railroad of its duty to warn where the crossing was deemed ultra-hazardous, and plaintiff deputy presented evidence that his sight line to the right of the crossing and the train’s approach was obscured by foliage.

        “Intersection” within the meaning of traffic statutes and regulations is a term used to describe the meeting of one street with another at an angle, although one of the streets may stop at and not cross the other street but the intersection must be formed by recognized public ways as distinguished from private ways.

        This section involves the regulation of pedestrian traffic at intersections and an unmarked crossing from a plant across a four-lane highway controlled by a flashing yellow light erected by the state highway department was not an intersection and pedestrian who entered the unmarked crossing and was struck by an automobile was contributorily negligent since flashing yellow light gave traffic on the highway the right-of-way.

        Since there is at every intersection not having a marked crosswalk an unmarked crosswalk, then this crosswalk should consist of that portion of the roadway at the intersection a pedestrian would be required to travel in crossing from curb to curb for a reasonable width to allow pedestrian travel.

        Pedestrian had right-of-way under this section if crossing in crosswalk and was not contributorily negligent as a matter of law where she allegedly continued to cross even though she saw oncoming taxi half a block away and left crosswalk to avoid accident.

        The “sudden appearance” doctrine is repudiated, and the giving of a “sudden appearance” instruction is reversible error; the instruction is condemned because it relieves the driver of responsibility if he exercises ordinary care after pedestrian appears in his path, even though antecedent negligence of driver caused him to get into a position where he could not avoid striking pedestrian after discovering him. Voluntary action on the part of a pedestrian by which he gets into the path of a moving car may be covered by a contributory negligence instruction. Dixon v. Stringer, 277

        “Last clear chance” doctrine could not be applied where pedestrian in crossing street not at intersection passed between cars running in almost solid line and as she emerged through line was struck by automobile which, in exercise of any kind of care, could not have avoided her.

        “Last clear chance” doctrine was applicable where pedestrian crossing city intersection when struck by automobile was contributorily negligent in walking against red light, but where street light was bright; question whether driver exercised ordinary care to avoid injury after he discovered, or in exercise of ordinary care could have discovered pedestrian’s peril, was jury question.

        It is only where the plaintiff is physically unable to escape from his peril that the defendant is held responsible under the last clear chance doctrine on the ground that he should have discovered the peril but where both parties are merely inattentive and the plaintiff has an equal opportunity to avoid the accident by some act on his part up to the moment of its occurrence then the doctrine does not apply and where plaintiff could have avoided the accident by a slight turn of the head and a hurried step he was not in a position of inextricable peril and it was error to instruct the jury on last clear chance.

        Though a pedestrian may be negligent in crossing a street, still he may recover if after his peril is discovered, or by ordinary care should have been discovered, the driver of the automobile could, by ordinary care, avoid injuring him, and a contributory negligence instruction should be so qualified.

        Where the plaintiff was struck by a car while he was walking on the wrong side of the road after getting off a bus, the presence of a city bus at the intersection, its observation by the defendant, the close proximity of the plaintiff to the crosswalk, the street light nearby, and the fact that the plaintiff was wearing a light colored overcoat were facts sufficient to submit the case to the jury on a last clear chance instruction.

        Where pedestrian, crossing street in easterly direction on unmarked crosswalk at intersection, was struck by automobile going north, and evidence was that pedestrian had traveled 32 feet across intersection before being hit, and automobile had traveled 150 feet since time pedestrian started across street, but driver did not see pedestrian until car was in middle of intersection, questions of negligence and contributory negligence were for jury.

        Where an automobile partially blocked the near side of a crosswalk at a busy intersection and a pedestrian walked behind it and was struck as she stepped from behind it by defendant’s vehicle making a left turn, the questions of the defendant’s negligence and of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence were properly submitted to the jury, whether or not the pedestrian was in the crosswalk at the time of being struck.

        Considering the special hazards normally existing at intersections and the purpose of the statute which gives the pedestrian a right-of-way, it was a jury question as to whether the pedestrian was in an unmarked crosswalk, or so close thereto that his rights were superior to those of the defendant driver.

        Where a driver struck a pedestrian, the trial court should have submitted to the jury the issues of negligence on the part of the driver and contributory negligence on the part of the pedestrian. Russell v. Lawless, 458 S.W.2d 176, 1970

       <p>
        Whether pedestrian acted as a reasonably prudent person in estimating the distance, speed, and time of both himself and the automobile, and then attempting to cross in front of it was a jury question and the jury could reasonably believe that if pedestrian had made the proper evaluation on distance, speed, and time, there would have been no need for him to take another look as he crossed the road.

        In the event that an emergency medical service vehicle which is transporting a patient to a hospital on an emergency basis is involved in an accident, where the ambulance crew has determined that no one else who was involved in the accident has been injured in any way, it would not be violating this section in leaving the scene of the accident without first giving the information on vehicle registration and ownership to the driver of the other vehicle.

        When a peace officer spots a vehicle a short distance from the scene of an accident which he suspects as having been involved in the accident, he is justified in making an arrest for leaving the scene, for the reason that the driver is guilty of a continuing violation of this section and is still involved in leaving the scene at the time of the arrest, so that this misdemeanor is in fact being committed in the officer’s presence at the time of the arrest. It is not required that the officer witness the vehicle leaving the accident scene itself in order for the officer to make an arrest.

        Where a written accident report is provided by a law enforcement agency to the Bureau (now Department) of the State Police which forwards a copy of that report to the department of transportation, the practical purpose of accident reporting would be accomplished and the motor vehicle operator’s report would not have to be filed.

        City police division did not have to respond to newspaper’s request to obtain copies of all traffic accident reports within the jurisdiction on a weekly basis. Although traffic accident reports prepared by law enforcement officers pursuant to this section are not confidential and are open records, the right to inspect public records attaches only after those records have been “prepared, owned, used, in the possession of or retained by a public agency.” No such right attaches for records which have not yet come into existence. The Open Records Act governs access to existing public records, not to prospective requests. City can require newspaper to submit a new application each time copies of records are requested and city need only honor requests for existing records. 97-ORD-18.
       </p>
       <p>
        The police department may rely on KRS 189.635(5) as the basis for denying any request for accident reports not submitted by the parties to the accident, the parents or guardians of a minor who is party to the accident, the insurers of any party who is the subject of the report, the attorneys of the parties, and news gathering organizations “solely for the purpose of publishing or broadcasting the news.” This specific confidentiality provision overrides the general rule of openness mandated by the Open Records Act. OAG 01-ORD-127.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Division of Police improperly relied on KRS 61.878(1)(a) in partially denying news-gathering requesters access to those portions of accident reports containing information of a personal nature. Because KRS 189.635(6) places no restriction on the information in the accident reports that must be disclosed to news-gathering organizations, limiting only the use to which the information may be put, these organizations are entitled to the same right of access as the parties identified in KRS 189.635(5). OAG 02-ORD-19.
       </p>
       <p>
        KRS 189.635(5), in tandem with KRS 61.878(1)(l), requires that a public agency deny a request for copies of accident reports not submitted by parties to the accident, the parents or guardians of a minor who is party to the accident, the insurers of any party who is the subject of the report, the attorneys of the parties, and news gathering organizations “solely for the purpose of publishing or broadcasting the news.” This specific confidentiality provision overrides the general rule of openness mandated by the Open Records Act.

        , that statute applies to it and its accident reports are exempt from disclosure, unless a requester falls within one of the classes entitled to a copy of the report. OAG 02-ORD-155.
       </p>
       <p>
        Request for an accident report involving a city truck was proper under the Open Records Act; however, the requested record was excluded from public inspection by operation of KRS 189.635(5). OAG 06-ORD-024.
       </p>
       <p>
        The confidentiality provision in KRS 189.635(5) admits of only the specifically enumerated exceptions found in its concluding sentence and in KRS 189.635(6). It does not permit disclosure of the accident report if the vehicle involved in the accident is a city vehicle being driven by a city employee. Nor does it permit disclosure based on the requester’s goals and intended use. OAG 2006-ORD-024.

        is a neutral law of general applicability, and does not invoke strict scrutiny analysis; the Commonwealth’s objective of ensuring public safety through the most effective means possible by use of an emblem to alert to a slow-moving vehicle overshadowed any encumbrances on religious practices.
        KRS 189.820 would have passed constitutional muster if a strict scrutiny analysis was applied; an argument that a bicycle exemption created a showing of legislative belief that slow-moving vehicle emblems did not promote roadway safety was rejected, and an argument that reflective tape was a less restrictive alternative was also rejected.

        , a claim of selective enforcement was not shown because the testimony of a witness relating to non-Amish slow-moving vehicles was discounted by the trial court, a non-Amish vehicle that did not receive a citation for failing to have a slow-moving vehicle emblem was not akin to a dark buggy, and, even though there were few prosecutions for these violations outside of the county at issue, there was no information relating to the distribution of a particular Amish community outside of this county.

       Considering the definition of “emergency vehicle” given in KRS 189.910(1), if the vehicle is used by the sheriff or his lawful deputies in the performance of his official duties and for law enforcement emergency purposes, it should be equipped with the blue lights required by subsection (2) of this section regardless of whether the vehicle is owned by the county, the sheriff, a deputy, or some other person or corporation; the term “lawful deputies” means those deputies filling regular deputy positions as authorized by orders of the fiscal court under KRS

       A coroner’s vehicle is not an “emergency vehicle” and it is not included among those types of vehicles which are authorized and required to utilize red or blue flashing, rotating or oscillating lights and sirens, bells or whistles; the coroner may not use such equipment on his vehicle even when he is proceeding to the scene of an accident.

       The vehicles of constables are not “emergency vehicles,” as defined in KRS 189.910(1); accordingly, the fiscal court cannot pass an ordinance to authorize duly elected constables to place blue lights and sirens upon their cars to be used in the performance of their statutory duties.

        Although subsection (1) of this section does not specify to which side of the street a driver should go, it is to be expected that he will normally go to to the right side as far as possible and stop; therefore, an emergency vehicle will usually pass on the left even if it means going into an oncoming lane and even if the right lane is open.

        Officer’s conduct in suddenly stopping his car in the left lane of an interstate highway would be negligent per se. The evidence and argument presented, however, seemed to have been aimed at showing that, since he was a police officer, he had a valid excuse for disregarding the applicable statute. Officer had the right to argue that he should be exonerated because, as a police officer, he had the right to disregard traffic regulations. But having allowed into evidence officer’s reasons for stopping, the trial court was obligated to set out officer’s duties and the conditions in the jury instruction’s under which his disregard of the law could be excused.

        In an action against the city based on the alleged negligence of the operator of a police cruiser in going through a red light, an instruction requiring the operator of the police car to “observe traffic regulations governing the flow of traffic at that time and place,” was erroneous since it did not inform the jury that the operator of the police cruiser had a right to run a red light by exercising due regard to the safety of the public.

        Law that provided that ambulances, fire apparatus and patrols had right-of-way and law exempting emergency vehicles from speed limitations gave emergency vehicles the right to disregard traffic regulations at intersections when due regard for the safety of the public was observed and instruction was faulty where it told jury driver had duty to operate the fire truck with due regard to the safety of the public but did not instruct jury that driver had a right to run the red light by exercising due regard for the safety of the public.

        Where the defendant was driving through an intersection when she had the green light and struck a police cruiser traveling in a storage lane and going through the intersection on a red light with its siren and lights operating, the defendant was not required to yield the right-of-way or to anticipate that the police cruiser would run the red light unless the warning was adequate for a person in her position.

        Where a police cruiser intended not only to run a red light, but to use an extraordinary path in reaching the intersection, it could reasonably be considered that a warning which merely signified that an emergency vehicle was approaching was not adequate to give notice of the extraordinary course the vehicle would pursue.

        Although an ambulance operating with a silent siren is an emergency vehicle the driver when so operating should observe all traffic signals in the same manner as the driver of a nonemergency vehicle.

        A privately owned vehicle of a volunteer fireman, not equipped with the proper lights and audible devices, is not an “emergency vehicle” and is not exempt from traffic regulations so that the driver of such a vehicle, proceeding to the fire station in response to an alarm, must observe all traffic laws in the same manner required by other drivers.

        While the operator of an emergency vehicle should travel the wrong way on a one-way street only when the circumstances make it necessary to do so, each case has to be judged on its particular circumstances; and if the operator believes that the street is blocked as far as being able to travel the direction allowed and has his lights flashing and his siren sounding, he would be justified in proceeding the wrong way on the one-way street though caution would dictate that he should travel at a slow speed and give oncoming traffic ample opportunity to get out of his path.

        An emergency vehicle may use any avenue available to it under the circumstances, even to traveling on the shoulder, sidewalk or median, but in such unusual maneuvers a driver should use special caution in proceeding and should use his lights and audible alarms.

        A coroner’s vehicle is not an “emergency vehicle” and it is not included among those types of vehicles which are authorized and required to utilize red or blue flashing, rotating or oscillating lights and sirens, bells or whistles; the coroner may not use such equipment on his vehicle even when he is proceeding to the scene of an accident.

        While a fireman whose chief has authorized him, in writing, to equip his vehicle with flashing red lights and a siren pursuant to subsection (4) of this section may utilize those devices while proceeding to the scene of a fire or other emergency in the performance of his official duties as a member of the fire department, he may not utilize his flashing red lights and siren while departing from the scene of a fire or other emergency; accordingly, if it was determined that an accident victim needed to be rushed to a hospital and could not be transported under normal driving conditions, then an ambulance or other authorized emergency vehicle should have been called to the scene, because the fireman did not have the authority to utilize his flashing red lights and siren to depart from the scene and transport the accident victim to the hospital.

        Where a fire chief has exercised his discretionary authority pursuant to this section and permitted, in writing, members of his fire department to equip their personal vehicles with flashing red lights and sirens for use while proceeding to the scene of a fire or other emergency, that permission to so act terminates when he ceases to be fire chief. Permission must be obtained in writing from the successor as fire chief if the members of the fire department are to continue to use flashing red lights and sirens on their private vehicles.

        Pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, any constable in Kentucky may use blue lights on his official emergency vehicle, provided such use is formally approved by the fiscal court of his county, except in an urban county government, where the constable’s use of blue lights must be approved by the urban county council.

        For a fiscal court to be liable for the wrongful conduct of a constable, the wrongdoing by the constable must be directly attributable to the use of the blue lights or siren and the fiscal court must have acted negligently in approving the use of blue lights under subsection (5) of this section.

        Because there is no statute authorizing a constable to equip a vehicle with a fixed or stationary blue light, and no statutory command that a motorist stop or yield the right-of-way to a vehicle using a fixed or stationary blue light, and because of public policy considerations, a constable may not lawfully equip a vehicle with a fixed or stationary blue light.

        KRS 189.520(2) and subsection (9) (now subsection (8)) of this section must be construed by the express or literal language contained therein; accordingly, any previous conviction under KRS 189.520(2) may be used for enhancement purposes under subsection (9) (now subsection (8)) of this section. If proof of previous convictions cannot be obtained from the Transportation Cabinet due to a destruction of records which are over five years old or have occurred prior to June 21, 1974, proof by any other means is acceptable so long as introduction of such proof complies with the rules on evidence.

        Where the arresting officer’s testimony sufficiently showed that he made a proper request of the driver to submit to a blood test and the driver’s testimony strongly indicated that he had understood what the officer had asked of him, the findings of the commissioner that the driver had refused the test were neither arbitrary nor capricious. Commonwealth, Dep't of Public Safety v. Cheek, 451 S.W.2d 394, 1970
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 384

        Where there was no positive unequivocal “request,” within the meaning of the word, that the motorist should submit to a blood alcohol test, his driver’s license would not be revoked because of mere refusal to submit to the test without such request. Timberlake v. Commonwealth Dep't of Public Safety, 464 S.W.2d 283, 1971
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 489

        Driver who requested a blood test when he was stopped for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol, but refused to sign a consent form at the hospital and so did not have the test, should not have had his license revoked, as he did not refuse to have a blood test when requested by an officer to have one. Commonwealth Dep't Public Safety v. Carpenter, 467 S.W.2d 338, 1971

        Although defendant orally agreed to take the chemical breath test after his arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, the officer’s testimony that defendant, after knowing of the effect of eating on the administration of the test, deliberately ate a candy mint and defendant’s statement, “God damn your old test,” was sufficient evidence that defendant had refused to take the test. Newman v. Smith, 481 S.W.2d 679, 1972
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 269

        Evidence of extreme intoxication was not such a condition as to render a person incapable of responding to a definite and positive request to submit to the test unless the person was in a complete drunken stupor or passed out, and in order to comply with former law concerning consent to take a blood alcohol test there must have been a positive and specific request addressed to the licensee to take the test, and, in addition, there must have been a refusal either express or implied by the licensee. Commonwealth, Dep't of Public Safety v. Hayden, 484 S.W.2d 97, 1972

        Where the defendant, as soon as he was apprehended, embarked upon a deliberate program of eating, drinking and smoking designed to frustrate an accurate chemical test, such a course was tantamount to an absolute refusal to submit to the test, regardless of an oral statement to the contrary. Moseley v. Commonwealth, 492 S.W.2d 204, 1973
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 511

        Where a motorist, who was arrested on a charge of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, was not told by the arresting officer that if he failed to take a breathalyzer test he would automatically lose his driver’s license but was warned that the chances were that he would, the motorist was adequately warned of the consequences of his refusal to take the test. Commonwealth, Dep't of Public Safety v. Tuemler, 526 S.W.2d 305, 1975

       <p>
        Where the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant was in physical control of his automobile while under the influence of intoxicating beverages and there was sufficient evidence in the record that defendant refused to take the breathalyzer test after repeated requests and warnings that his refusal could result in revocation of his license, the warnings sufficiently apprised defendant of the effect of his refusal in accordance with former law regarding consent to test for alcohol in the blood and an order suspending defendant’s license for six months was proper. Elkin v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Vehicle Regulation, 646 S.W.2d 45, 1982

        When defendant twice refused to submit to a breathalyzer and was informed of the consequences of such action pursuant to this section, law enforcement officers are not required to administer the breathalyzer at a later time after defendant changes her mind and agrees to submit to the test.

        Defendant did not have standing to argue that KRS 189A.010(2), which applied to test results taken over two (2) hours after cessation of operation or physical control of a motor vehicle, was constitutional. Because her own test result was within the two-hour time period, the section was not relevant or applicable to her case, and she therefore could not have suffered any injury or harm from it.

        While sometimes actual impaired driving is what calls the officer’s attention to a particular vehicle and justifies the initial stop, that justification can also come from minor violations which may or may not demonstrate impaired driving; consequently, although evidence of impaired driving and/or impaired driving ability is often present in a DUI trial, neither is an essential element of the offense.

        Since motor vehicle is not defined in KRS Chapter 189A the term will be construed by the court in accordance with its common and approved usage; therefore, since a farm tractor is a vehicle, has a motor, and is frequently operated on public roads and highways, a farm tractor is a motor vehicle as that term is used in KRS Chapter 189A and the driver of a farm tractor can be prosecuted for DUI under such chapter.

        When testifying about standard field sobriety procedures, a police officer must be limited to describing the procedure administered and the observations of how the defendant performed it, without resort to terms such as “test,” “standardized clues,” “pass,” or “fail,” unless the government first has established a foundation that satisfies KRE 702 and the
        Daubert/Kumho Tire

        Because the maximum penalties for first-offense driving under the influence (DUI) are limited to a $500 fine or a 30-day term of imprisonment under KRS 189A.010(5)(a), first-offense DUI is a petty offense for which there is no common law or constitutional right to a jury trial when a defendant is not prosecuted by indictment or information under Ky.

        Although defendant had no common law or constitutional right to a jury trial in his prosecution for first-offense DUI because first-offense DUI is a petty offense and he was not prosecuted by indictment or information under Ky. Const. § 11, the requirements of RCr 9.26(1), including the requirement for the consent of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to a bench trial, were triggered when his case was originally scheduled for jury trial; because the Commonwealth did not consent, the district court erred in granting defendant’s motion for a bench trial, and the Commonwealth was entitled to a writ of prohibition to prevent the bench trial from proceeding.

        It was well within the province of the jury to conclude that a 19 year old man who weighed 195 pounds and who was presumptively under the influence of intoxicating beverages at 12:46 a.m. on Saturday was likewise under the influence when he drove his vehicle off the road at 11:15 p.m. on Friday; there can be no doubt at all of the existence of a rational connection between the established fact of a 0.14 blood alcohol concentration “at the time of making an analysis” and the presumed fact of being under the influence of alcohol at that time.

        Using defendants’ previous convictions for driving under the influence to enhance the penalty upon conviction under the new per se subsection of this section, was not a violation of the prohibitions against ex post facto laws of the Ky.

        The concurrent running of driving under influence (DUI) sentences is irrelevant in determining the number of convictions under subdivisions (4)(d) and (e) (now (5)(d) and (e)) of this section; so long as a defendant has actually been convicted of DUI on three prior occasions within five years, he can be convicted of DUI fourth offense.

        Since a fourth conviction for driving under the influence was considered to be a felony offense punishable by imprisonment of one to five years under KRS 189A.010(5)(d) and KRS 532.020(1)(a), and since driving while under the influence of intoxicants presented a serious potential risk that the driver would cause physical injury to another person, under the sentencing system established by the guidelines, defendant’s fourth conviction within a five-year period for driving under the influence should be considered a “crime of violence” that subjected defendant to sentencing as a career offender.

        Nothing in KRS 189A.010(1)(a), prohibiting the operation of a motor vehicle by a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or greater, and allowing enhanced penalties for repeat offenders, under KRS 189A.010(5), limited its application to persons at least 21 years old, despite the existence of KRS 189.010(1)(e), prohibiting the operation of a motor vehicle by a person under 21 with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, which did not allow for enhanced penalties, so a person under 21 could be prosecuted under KRS 189.010(1)(a) for driving with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or greater and could be subject to enhanced penalties for repeat offenses, but the Commonwealth had to provide notice of the subsection it was proceeding under.

        Punishment for a driving under the influence conviction under KKRS 189A.010(1)(e) was contained in KRS 189A.010(6), yet KRS 189A.010(7), which was limited to persons under the age of 21, directed punishment for an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more under KRS 189A.010(5), and this directive revealed no intent of the legislature that persons under the age of 21 with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more be immunized from the severe penalties of KRS 189.010(5).

        While KRS 189A.010(5), providing enhanced penalties for repeat driving under the influence convictions, did not recognize a conviction of a person under 21 under KRS 189A.010(1)(e) as punishable under that subsection, KRS 189A.010(7) directed punishment of persons under 21 with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or greater pursuant to KRS 189A.010(5), so it followed that the legislature intended for persons under the age of 21 who were convicted under KRS 189A.010(1)(a) to be punished under KRS 189A.010(5) as was prescribed in KRS 189A.010(7).

        Persons under the age of 21 could be punished for having a lower alcohol concentration than persons who were of age, but suffer less severe punishment for such violations, but there was no indication that the general assembly intended that persons under 21 be subject only to the lesser penalties of KRS 189A.010(1)(e), and persons under the age of 21 who violated KRS 189A.010(1)(a) would be subject to the penalties prescribed in KRS 189A.010(5).

        Defendant could be prosecuted for a driving under the influence (DUI) fourth offense, when two prior convictions were not entered when defendant committed defendant's current crime, because, under the applicable two-pronged approach, (1) the prior convictions occurred within five years before the current crime, and (2) convictions for the prior crimes were entered before the current conviction, as impaired drivers were subject to both criminal sanctions under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 189A.010(5) and license suspensions under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 189A.070(1), the number of convictions of record at the time of a new conviction determined a suspension's length, and Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 189A.070(1)(e) said “offense” had the same meaning for both purposes. Ballinger v. Commonwealth, 459 S.W.3d 349, 2015

        When determining whether a prior conviction for driving under the influence (DUI) may be used to enhance an offender's penalty, there is a two-part inquiry under which the first question is whether the alleged predicate offense was committed within the five-year period preceding the commission of the current offense, and the second question is whether the conviction for that prior offense was entered prior to the defendant's conviction for the current offense by either guilty plea or verdict.

        Unpublished decision:
    Any error in admitting defendant’s refusal of a blood test was harmless, under RCr P. 9.24, because (1) defendant admitted consuming alcohol and driving, and (2) defendant’s recorded interaction with an officer and subsequent sobriety testing showed defendant was intoxicated, so allowing driving under the influence to be presumed based on defendant’s refusal to submit to a blood test was cumulative.

        Unpublished decision:
    For purposes of a penalty enhancement under
        KRS 189A.010(5)(e), the determining factor as to whether conviction of a subsequent offense is proper is the existence of a credible record showing conviction of a prior offense; it is the timing of the convictions that control, not the timing of the arrests. Therefore, a trial court erred by granting defendant’s motion to amend a driving under the influence (DUI) 4th offense to a DUI 2nd under
        KRS 189A.010(5)(e) because, at the time of defendant’s fourth arrest, he had one prior DUI conviction and two pending DUI charges; he pled guilty to the two pending cases prior to his indictment for DUI 4th.

        The service fee described in subsections (1) and (3) of this section is constitutional, since it in no way violates Ky. Const., § 51; the 1984 Act (Chapter 165) enacting this section has only one subject, “An Act relating to crimes and punishments”; the service fee is not an appropriation, as envisioned in Ky. Const., § 230 and KRS

        Considering that the Finance and Transportation Cabinets and the Administrative Office of the Courts, as well as state and local law-enforcement officers, may have some entitlement to share in the distribution of the service fee collected under this section, the actual scheme of allocating and distributing such fees deposited in a special bank account may be equitably and functionally determined through the coordinated regulatory action of the Finance and Transportation Cabinets and the Administrative Office of the Courts; in structuring an equitable, but workable scheme of distribution, they should also be guided by what is deemed to be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of the act.

        The legislative intent of this section is to raise the seriousness of the offense as well as the punishment based on the number of times a defendant has committed the offense of operating a vehicle while his license is suspended or revoked. Estis v. Commonwealth, 864 S.W.2d 317, 1993
        <cite class="ky_code">

        Where defendant previously pled guilty to the felony offense of operating on a suspended license, he had judicially admitted the underlying requisites. Consequently, the circuit court unquestionably had jurisdiction to try him, as this was a subsequent offense under Subdivision (2)(c). Toppass v. Commonwealth, 799 S.W.2d 587, 1990
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. App. LEXIS 133

        (Ky. Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require that a defendant first be convicted of a Class A misdemeanor for the second such offense before he can be convicted of a Class D felony; he need only be shown to have been previously convicted of two or more violations of subsection (1) of this section; therefore, defendant who was convicted twice under this section, each time for a first offense, could be convicted as a third offender, a Class D felony, when his two previous convictions were both first offenses. Estis v. Commonwealth, 864 S.W.2d 317, 1993

        Trial court did not err in permitting the driving history record from the Department of Transportation to be used to prove prior revoked or suspended licenses in lieu of prior judgments of convictions or duly authenticated copies thereof. Toppass v. Commonwealth, 799 S.W.2d 587, 1990
        <cite class="ky_code">

        Although defendant was indicted for his fourth DUI offense on the same date he was also charged in a separate indictment for being a persistent felony offender (PFO), based on his prior felony conviction for operating a motor vehicle (OMV) while his license was suspended or revoked by his third DUI offense, the prior DUI convictions are separate convictions from the OMV on a revoked license charge; thus it was not double enhancement for court to allow the OMV for revoked license charge to enhance the fourth DUI charge for PFO purposes. Corman v. Commonwealth, 908 S.W.2d 122, 1995
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. App. LEXIS 82
        </cite>
        (Ky. Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is permissible that some prior offenses are used to elevate the charged offense to a felony, while another prior offense is used for persistent felony offender (PFO) enhancement. Newcomb v. Commonwealth, 964 S.W.2d 228, 1998
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. App. LEXIS 15

        (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike the DUI statute, this section does not include a time limitation on the use of prior OSL convictions to enhance subsequent convictions, and the trial court erred when it added the requirement that in order to use a prior conviction for enhancement purposes under this section, the conviction must have occurred within a five-year period. Commonwealth v. Garnett, 8 S.W.3d 573, 1999
        <cite class="ky_code">

        , that were used to obtain a persisent felony offender (PFO) enhancement of defendant’s present convictions were not the convictions used to enhance defendant’s present DUI and DUI/OSL convictions to Class D felonies, they were properly used for PFO enhancement under KRS 532.080(6)(b). Parson v. Commonwealth, 144 S.W.3d 775, 2004

        Court of Appeals erred in vacating defendant's third conviction for operating a motor vehicle on a DUI-suspended driver's license under the statutory enhancement provision because defendant failed to properly preserve his argument that he was completely denied counsel in his underlying convictions.

        Defendant’s sentences for both driving under the influence (DUI), KRS 189A.010(1)(a), and operating a motor vehicle while his license was suspended for DUI, KRS 189A.090(1), did not violate his double jeopardy rights under KRS 505.020(2)(a), since being under the influence was not an element of each offense. As each offense required the proof of different elements, sentencing on both convictions was not double jeopardy. Lay v. Commonwealth, 207 S.W.3d 18, 2006

        Implied consent law permitted the police to take a blood test of a driver who was unconscious; however, the warrantless testing was permissible only if the police had probable cause to believe that the unconscious driver had been driving while under the influence of alcohol. If the police lacked probable cause and only took the blood test because the accident in which the driver was involved resulted in fatalities, then the testing violated the Fourth Amendment’s proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The entire purpose of the implied consent law was to control the number of persons driving motor vehicles while intoxicated. There is no statute that implies the operator of a nonmotor vehicle must submit to a breathalyzer test; therefore, subsection (7) would have been meaningless unless it also applied to motor vehicles.

        Court of appeals erred in reversing the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss a driving under the influence charge because, while defendant was certainly free to express an opinion as to his testing preference, the police officer had statutory authority to determine which of the three tests to utilize, and, even if defendant asserted a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, which he did not, he lacked the requisite standing where an actual blood test was never performed due to his refusal to consent.

        As an intoxilyzer was in proper working order, and the foundation requirements for admission of the test results were satisfied, the arresting officer’s failure to check the simulator’s hoses for warmth and to determine whether its paddle was properly turned went to the weight of the evidence, rather than to its admissibility; therefore, the district court judge erred in suppressing the results.

        With regard to the requirement for admissibility at trial of a breath test that a defendant not be permitted to take food or drink within 15 minutes before taking the test, KRS 189A.103(3)(a) changes the standard concerning the 15-minute time frame and specifies that a peace officer must personally observe a defendant for 20 minutes.

        Admission of the Intoxilyzer test results was not erroneous despite inconsistencies in the officer’s testimony as to whether the officer observed defendant for 20 minutes prior to administering the test, because the trial court was in the best position to resolve the inconsistencies in the officer’s testimony and its determination was not clearly erroneous.

        Although former law concerning consent to blood alcohol test did not prescribe any particular volume of air which must have been breathed into the breathalyzer equipment to constitute compliance, the fact that defendant exhaled into the machine one time and no reading was obtained, in the absence of a showing of the impossibility of compliance or the likelihood of harm resulting therefrom, was not sufficient compliance.

        Where defendant was accused of driving under the influence under KRS 189A.010(1), the case was dismissed as defendant was denied the right under KRS 189A.103(7) to obtain an independent blood test; where defendant had the $150 for the blood test in defendant’s purse, but defendant, upon the officer’s instruction, left defendant’s purse in defendant’s car before going to the police station, the officer should have granted defendant’s request to arrange for the $150 to be brought to defendant, whose roommate had picked up defendant’s car.

        When a court determines whether a defendant has been denied the right to an independent blood test pursuant to KRS 189A.103(7), the court is to consider the totality of the circumstances, including, but not limited to: (1) availability of or access to funds or resources to pay for the requested test; (2) a protracted delay in the giving of the test if the officer complies with the defendant’s requests; (3) availability of police time and other resources; (4) location of requested facilities, e.g., the hospital to which the defendant wants to be taken is nearby but in a different jurisdiction; and (5) opportunity and ability of accused to make arrangements personally for the testing.

        Where a police officer failed to use reasonable efforts to facilitate defendant’s statutory entitlement to an independent alcohol concentration test by transporting defendant to a nearby hospital that the officer knew conducted private testing after a first hospital refused to conduct a private test, the trial court erred in dismissing the charge; the appropriate sanction was the suppression of the breathalyzer test, and the Commonwealth could proceed with the prosecution with other evidence.

        Denial of defendant's motion to suppress the results of defendant's initial blood test was appropriate because when defendant requested that an independent test be performed at a different hospital, the deputy sheriff who arrested defendant made sufficient efforts to facilitate such a test at a different hospital in another town, but was unable to facilitate such a test because of the low staffing level for the sheriff's department on that night.

        Defendant was not entitled to suppression of a blood test due to an officer's failure to advise of the right to an independent test because defendant did not submit to all tests the officer requested, including a breath test, so defendant was not entitled to request an independent test, as Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 189A.105(2)(a)(3) was clear in that a person's right to request an independent blood test arose only after he or she submitted to all tests an officer requests, and the fact that defendant agreed to submit to a more invasive blood test was irrelevant.

        Unpublished decision:
    Under the implied consent law, the circuit court erred by holding an arresting officer had the option as to which test may be given in a DUI case—a blood test or a breathalyzer. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky held that the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream did not present a per se exigency that justified an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing in drunk-driving cases.

        In a defendant’s trial for murder resulting from a fatality wherein defendant was accused of driving under the influence of liquor, the refusal of the trial court to suppress defendant’s blood alcohol test results was not in error, despite the arresting officer erroneously informing defendant that he was prohibited from contacting an attorney until and unless he agreed to take the test, where a search warrant was properly obtained and served upon defendant pursuant to KRS 189A.105(2)(b) as a result of defendant being charged with a qualifying offense that had resulted in death, which caused the issue of erroneously having been denied the opportunity to contact counsel to become moot as the issuance of the warrant rendered such wrongful refusal harmless; defendant also made no incriminating statements at the hospital.

        Implied consent law permitted the police to take a blood test of a driver who was unconscious without obtaining a warrant; however, the warrantless testing was permissible only if the police had probable cause to believe that the unconscious driver had been driving while under the influence of alcohol. If the police lacked probable cause and only took the blood test because the accident in which the driver was involved resulted in fatalities, then the testing violated the Fourth Amendment’s proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.

        Though an arresting officer’s violation of KRS 189A.105(3) in refusing defendant’s request to contact an attorney before taking a blood alcohol level test rendered defendant’s refusal involuntary, the trial court’s error in admitting defendant’s refusal as evidence of his intoxication was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in a case of first impression in Kentucky where the evidence of defendant’s intoxication at the time of a collision that caused the death of a pregnant woman was overwhelming as defendant had admitted to the arresting officer that he had been drinking all day, he smelled of alcohol, was unsteady on his feet, and slurred his speech, the videotape of the field sobriety tests permitted the jurors to observe defendant’s intoxicated condition for themselves, and the result of the trial finding defendant guilty of wanton murder would not have been any different had the evidence of defendant’s refusal to take the test been excluded.

        Commonwealth was entitled to a patient’s blood test results from a hospital for purposes of prosecuting a driving under the influence case against the patient where the patient had consented to a blood sample for purposes of medical treatment; nothing in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, 42 U.S.C.S. § 201 et seq., or regulations under that Act required a balancing test.

       <p>
        Since the “right” described by KRS 189A.105(3) was very circumscribed, as it was merely the right to an opportunity to attempt to contact and communicate with an attorney, and the statute specifically avoided creating a right to have counsel present, KRS 189A.105(3) and RCr 2.14 were not violated.

        Officer’s actions in dialing telephone numbers for attorneys provided by defendant before administering an Intoxilyzer test, instead of allowing defendant to dial the telephone himself, was not improper because KRS 189A.105(3) did not require law enforcement to allow defendants to dial the telephone; the officer testified that he would have allowed defendant to listen to the telephone as it was ringing, if defendant had asked, and defendant provided no contrary evidence. It was proper for the local telephone book to be provided to defendant, as there were attorneys’
        telephone numbers listed, but the officer did not need to provide any further means for defendant to obtain an attorney’s telephone number. Bhattacharya v. Commonwealth, 292 S.W.3d 901, 2009

        Defendant’s motion to suppress the results of a breathalyzer test due to an alleged violation of KRS 189A.105(3) was improperly denied, as defendant’s right to contact and communicate with defendant’s attorney was frustrated by the state action of frustrating defendant’s ability to use defendant’s cell phone that contained the attorney’s number.

        In a DUI case, the circuit court did not err by suppressing defendant’s breath test results because his statutory right to contact an attorney under
        KRS 189A.105(3) was denied when the police refused to allow him to contact his daughter to obtain his attorney’s telephone number. Commonwealth v. Bedway, 2012 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1043 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 26, 2012), rev'd, 466 S.W.3d 468, 2015

        With respect to access to legal counsel during breath testing under
        KRS 189A.105(3), the legislature has bestowed the right to at least attempt to seek the advice of counsel. Ignoring the mandates of the informed consent statute without fear of suppression would render the statute meaningless and incentivize law enforcement practices that do not conform to the legislature’s mandate.

        Law enforcement must make a reasonable effort to accommodate a suspect in his attempt to contact an attorney under
        KRS 189A.105(3) before submitting to a breath test, which can include permitting him to obtain contact information through a third party; under the totality of the circumstances, a trial court must determine whether this right is reasonably facilitated. Factors to include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) time of day; (2) whether the suspect is attempting to obtain the numbers of a specific attorney whom he knows personally, or knows by reputation; (3) whether the suspect affirmatively states that a third party has an attorney phone number not available in the phonebook; and (4) whether the request is timely.

        The request of a police officer for a motorist who has been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol to submit to test of blood, breath, urine or saliva should have been phrased as to call for a response which, if negative, was a refusal instead of a mere declination.

        The word “request” in former law regarding consent to test for alcohol in the blood while operating a vehicle in Kentucky meant to demand rather than to offer. Commonwealth, Dep't of Public Safety v. Powers, 453 S.W.2d 260, 1970

        Where the words used by the officers were calculated to convey to the arrested driver the thought that to take the test was a privilege being offered him rather than a waiver of protection on the giving of evidence against his interests, there was no “request” within the meaning of former law regarding consent to test for alcohol in blood of motorist.

        Suppression of a blood alcohol concentration result collected from defendant, a Spanish-speaking person suspected of drunk driving, was not required because the arresting officer’s reading of the implied consent warning to defendant in English satisfied Kentucky’s implied consent law. Furthermore, when given the option, defendant weighed whether to contact an attorney, ultimately choosing not to do so. Commonwealth ex rel. Logan Cty. Atty. v. Williams, 2019

       <p>
        A sworn report by the arresting officer was mandatory to begin the license revocation process pursuant to former law that provided for revocation of driver’s license for refusing consent to test alcohol in blood. While the swearing need not be the formal procedure used in courts to swear in witnesses, there should have been a positive statement by the officer that the report contains the truth and was sufficient so long as the affiant appeared before the notary and signed the document or acknowledged the signature in the presence of a notary while being aware that the affidavit was to be accepted and processed as a sworn document. Therefore, where the officer had failed to sign the affidavit in the presence of a notary the Transportation Cabinet had no authority to hold a hearing or issue a final order on defendant’s license revocation. Commonwealth, Transp. Cabinet, Dep't of Vehicle Regulation v. Williams, 833 S.W.2d 385, 1992
        <cite class="ky_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s combative and belligerent conduct on the date of her arrest for driving under the influence did not amount to a refusal to submit to an intoxilyzer examination because the reading of the implied consent warning was mandatory under KRS 189A.105(2)(a); the officers did not do so even though defendant was not required to listen to the warning. Commonwealth v. Rhodes, 308 S.W.3d 720, 2010
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. App. LEXIS 63

       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly reversed the district court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress the results of an intoxilyzer test because the excessive cost of the blood test charged by a medical school deprived defendant of the opportunity to challenge the results in a meaningful fashion and hindered his fundamental right to due process to develop and present any exculpatory evidence in his own defense where the Legislature afforded him—in mandatory language—the right to the test.

        Police officer satisfied his duties under Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 189A.105(4) where he informed defendant of his right to have an independent blood test performed, specifically asked whether defendant wanted the test, and made reasonable efforts to provide transportation, and although the cost of the test was concerning, defendant failed to identify any additional assistance by the officer that could have resulted in defendant obtaining the test.

        Circuit court erred in granting defendant’s motion to suppress her blood test following her arrest for DUI as involuntary because the information to be given and the warnings about the consequences of refusing or submitting to a test were statutorily provided, which included the doubling of mandatory minimum sentences for refusing consent, and defendant validly offered her consent after being read the implied consent warnings.

        A prosecutor may properly agree to the ninety day suspension versus a six months suspension for refusal to take a breathalyzer test when a defendant pleads guilty to a drunk driving charge, if the guilty plea is entered before the trial judge determines that defendant refused to submit to a blood alcohol test.

        Order allowing the Commonwealth to amend to reduce a fourth-offense operating a motor vehicle under the influence (DUI) charge to a second-offense DUI in order to avoid impermissible double enhancements was error because defendant had refused to submit to an alcohol concentration test, and, thus, such a motion to amend was prohibited by KRS 189A.120(1); clearly, by moving to amend, the Commonwealth had improperly agreed to the amendment. Nothing in KRS 189A.120(1) led to the conclusion that the Commonwealth was only prohibited from concurring in a defense motion to amend while remaining free to seek such an amendment on its own.

        It was not constitutionally necessary to have the breathalyzer operator testify at a revocation hearing where a different officer arrested defendant; although having the operator testify would be the better procedure, it is not necessary since defendant could cross-examine the arresting officer who was present at all relevant times and could testify as to the facts of the refusal, even if he was unable to quote them verbatim.

        To determine whether a bank or finance company is a “dealer” needing a license and a dealer’s registration tag in disposing of automobiles on which there is a deficiency the definition in KRS 139.110(1)(c) (now repealed) is used.

        Motor vehicle dealers in states other than Kentucky are eligible to respond to invitations to bid on new motor vehicles and subsequently sell the vehicles to Kentucky upon proper award, even though they are not licensed as dealers under this section, since the statutes under KRS Chapter 190, and the Model Procurement Code, KRS Chapter 45A, are not in pari materia and do not have to be construed together.

In circumstances where a customer’s or other person’s vehicle is out of use because of breakdown, repair, or servicing and a motor vehicle is loaned, with or without consideration, the coverage mandated by this section shall be in excess of, and be deemed secondary to, the collision, bodily injury, and property damage liability coverage under a customer’s or other person’s own coverage for that person’s own negligence; otherwise the coverage mandated by this section shall be primary.

        If the Bureau of Vehicle Regulation (now Department) issues a license to a dealer or salesman knowing him to be a former felon and he later commits other crimes in the area of the activities for which the Bureau (now Department) licensed him, the Bureau (now Department) has no liability since the members of a licensing board are immune from civil liability for the quasi-judicial decisions within the scope of their authority without regard for bad faith, malice or other evil motives.

        The implication of KRS Chapter 335B is that a licensing authority should look beyond the mere record of a felony conviction and should not arbitrarily refuse all former felons, although the chapter does not expressly order the authority to consider former felons the better policy is to review each case on its merits and not to have a policy of arbitrary rejection.

        In a contract case, there was no error in a default judgment that limited post-judgment interest on a retail installment contract to 12 percent per annum because a purchaser did not agree to the accrual of interest at any rate, much less at a rate in excess of the statutory rate; the purchaser agreed only to buy a vehicle at a price determined by adding the cost of the vehicle if she had paid cash and the time price differential. Moreover, the court could not deviate from the 12 percent rate because the claim here was for liquidated damages. Serv. Fin. Co. v. Ware, 2015

        KRS 360.150 excludes manufactured home financing transactions which provide for a fixed rate of interest payable in substantially equal successive installments over a fixed term; these financing transactions fall under the statutory requirements of the Motor Vehicle Retail Installment Sales Act because they would fall under the broad definition of “motor vehicle” as contained in subsection (4) of this section. Since there is no longer a ceiling on the cash price sale of such transactions, the Motor Vehicle Retail Installment Sales Act would be applicable in all manufactured home financing transactions where there was a fixed rate of interest.

        In a contract case, there was no error in a default judgment that limited post-judgment interest on a retail installment contract to 12 percent per annum because a purchaser did not agree to the accrual of interest at any rate, much less at a rate in excess of the statutory rate; the purchaser agreed only to buy a vehicle at a price determined by adding the cost of the vehicle if she had paid cash and the time price differential. Moreover, the court could not deviate from the 12 percent rate because the claim here was for liquidated damages. Serv. Fin. Co. v. Ware, 2015
