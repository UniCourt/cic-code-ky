      <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol11">
       The General Assembly hereby declares:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol11a">
         The venting of coalbed methane and degasification of coal seams is approved by the Commonwealth for the purpose of ensuring the safe recovery of coal;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol11b">
         The positive economic impact of coal mining to the Commonwealth is currently greater than that of coalbed methane production;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol11c">
         Coalbed methane is not found in conventional gas reservoirs;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol11d">
         Any development of coalbed methane should be undertaken in a way to protect and preserve the environment and protect and preserve the coal for future safe mining and the maximum recovery of coal;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol11e">
         Commercial recovery and marketing of coalbed methane should be facilitated whenever appropriate to meet the energy needs of both the Commonwealth and the United States;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol11f">
         The extraction of methane from mineable coal enhances mine safety, promotes environmental goals and objectives, and conserves an important energy resource; and
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol11g">
         The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was enacted, in part, to encourage coalbed methane development and the Commonwealth should enact legislation to carry out the purpose of that act.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol12">
       Therefore, in order to encourage and ensure the fullest practical safe recovery of both coal and coalbed methane, consistent with the above declarations and findings, this chapter is established to:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol12a">
         Authorize coalbed methane well permits;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol12b">
         Regulate the design of coalbed methane wells and recovery techniques;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol12c">
         Authorize coalbed methane well drilling units and pooling interests therein;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol12d">
         Establish field rules; and
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol12e">
         Provide a process to enable coalbed methane well operators and coalbed methane owners to proceed with the orderly development and production of coalbed methane pending the judicial resolution of issues relating to coalbed methane ownership.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol13">
       Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) of this section, the General Assembly expressly finds that establishing an orderly process to permit and produce coalbed methane shall in no way be construed to create an inference or presumption as to the ownership of coalbed methane in any judicial or administrative proceeding, or be construed to or be used or interpreted to apply to any well otherwise permitted, approved, or regulated under KRS Chapter 353, except for any wells that are to be permitted, converted to, or operated as coalbed methane wells.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol14">
       It is hereby declared to be the public policy of this Commonwealth and in the public interest to:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol14a">
         Safeguard, preserve, and protect coal seams for safe mining; facilitate the expeditious, safe evacuation of coalbed methane from the coalbeds of this state; and maintain the ability and right of coal operators at all times to vent coalbed methane from mine areas for the safe recovery of coal;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol14b">
         Foster, encourage, and promote the commercial development of the Commonwealth’s coalbed methane by establishing procedures for issuing permits and forming drilling units for coalbed methane wells without adversely affecting the safety of mining or the mineability of coal seams;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol14c">
         Safeguard, protect, and enforce the correlative rights of coalbed methane operators and coalbed methane owners in a pool of coalbed methane so that each operator and owner may obtain his or her just and equitable share of production from coalbed methane;
        </li>
        <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.005ol14d">

       When two (2) or more separately owned tracts, or portions thereof, are embraced within a drilling unit, or when there are separately owned interests in all or part of any such drilling unit, the operators or owners of coalbed methane owning the interests may pool their interests for the development and operation of the drilling unit by voluntary agreement. These agreements may be based on the exercise of pooling rights or rights to establish units which are granted in any gas or oil lease, coal lease, coalbed methane lease, or similar instrument.

       A coalbed methane well penetrating one (1) or more workable coalbeds shall be drilled in a manner that will exclude, if practicable, all coalbed methane or coalbed methane pressure from the workable coalbed, except as is found in the workable coalbed itself. Each string of casing that is run through a workable coalbed shall be seated at least thirty (30) feet below the workable coalbed in twenty (20) feet of cement, mud, clay, or other nonporous material that will make an effective seal. If a second workable coalbed is found less than thirty (30) feet below the first workable coalbed, the casing shall be seated and mudded off as above provided at least thirty (30) feet below the second workable coalbed. If gas is found between the two (2) workable coalbeds, it shall be treated as prescribed by this chapter. After any such string of casing has been properly seated, drilling may proceed immediately.

      <li id="tXXVIIIc349s349.095ol12">
       When a coalbed methane well is drilled through the horizon of a workable coalbed where the coal has been removed, the hole shall be drilled at least thirty (30) feet below the workable coalbed, and shall be of a size sufficient to permit the placing of a liner, which shall start not less than twenty (20) feet beneath the horizon of the workable coalbed and extend not less than twenty (20) feet above it. The largest sized casing to be used in the well shall be centrally placed within this liner. The liner may be welded to the casing to be used, and the space between the liner and the casing shall be filled with cement as the liner and casing are lowered into the hole. Cement shall be placed in the bottom of the hole to a depth of twenty (20) feet to form a sealed seat for both liner and casing. Following the setting of the liner, drilling may proceed. If it is necessary to drill through the horizon of two (2) or more workable coalbeds where the coal has been removed, the liner shall be started not less than twenty (20) feet below the lowest horizon penetrated and shall extend to a point not less than twenty (20) feet above the highest horizon penetrated.

If a person other than the operator claims an interest in the equipment of a well proposed for plugging, the person shall provide documentation of that interest to the department within thirty (30) days of the date of publication of the notice of the department’s intent to plug a well. Prior to the department’s advertising of bids for the plugging of a well, the department shall release the well’s equipment to the person deemed to have an interest in that equipment. It shall be the duty of the interest holder to remove the equipment before the well is plugged. If documentation as to an asserted interest is not provided to the department in the manner described in this subsection or if a person deemed to be an interest holder fails to remove the equipment before a well is plugged, the department may sell or otherwise dispose of the equipment in accordance with this section.

       When any person submits to the department an application for a permit to drill a coalbed methane well, or to reopen, deepen, or temporarily abandon any coalbed methane well which is not covered by a surety bond, the department shall, except as provided in this section, require from the well operator a bond in the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000). The bonds shall be made in favor of the Department for Natural Resources, conditioned that the wells upon abandonment shall be plugged in accordance with the administrative regulations and that all records required by the department be filed as specified. All bonds shall remain in effect until the plugging of the well is approved by the department, or the bond is released by the department. Any well operator in lieu of the bond may file with the department a blanket bond in a sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), covering all coalbed methane wells drilled or to be drilled in the Commonwealth by the principal in the bond, and the acceptance and approval by the department of the blanket bond shall be in full compliance with the above provision requiring an individual well bond. The department may establish a bond in a sum greater than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for an individual well or blanket bond in sum greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) if the department determines that the particular circumstances of the drilling of the well or wells warrant an increase in the bond amount. A deposit in cash or a bank-issued irrevocable letter of credit may serve in lieu of either of the individual well or blanket bonds. A certificate of deposit, the principal of which is pledged in lieu of a bond and whose interest is payable to the party making the pledge, may also be accepted by the department. If an operator is required to post individual well bonds exceeding a total of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or elects to post a blanket bond, the certificate of deposit shall be accepted by the department in lieu of that portion of the amount of the bonds exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000). The bond or bonds referred to in this section shall be executed by the well operator as principal and, if a surety bond, by a corporate surety authorized to do business in the Commonwealth. A deposit in cash shall serve in lieu of either of the above bonds; all cash bonds accepted by the department shall be deposited into an interest-bearing account, with the interest thereon payable to the special agency account known as the coalbed methane well plugging fund, created in subsection (3) of this section, to be used in accordance with the purposes described therein.

      (7/13/2004). When this statute was enacted (2004 Ky. Acts ch. 65, sec. 29), the word “subchapter” was erroneously included in the first sentence of subsection (2). KRS Chapter 349, which was created in this bill, is not divided into subchapters. This manifest clerical or typographical error has been corrected by changing the word “subchapter” to “chapter” by the Reviser of Statutes pursuant to KRS

There was conflicting evidence as to whether royalties had been underpaid, and the lessee had cured the alleged default by paying the disputed amount while the appeal was pending; moreover, an alleged mining permit violation could not serve as a basis to find the lessee in default absent an agency determination under KRS ch. 350 that such a violation existed.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the Commonwealth is the leading producer of coal and that the production of coal in Kentucky contributes significantly to the nation’s energy needs. The General Assembly further finds that unregulated surface coal mining operations cause soil erosion, damage from rolling stones and overburden, landslides, stream pollution, the accumulation of stagnant water and the seepage of contaminated water, increase the likelihood of floods, destroy the value of land for agricultural purposes, destroy aesthetic values, counteract efforts for the conservation of soil, water and other natural resources, destroy or impair the property rights of citizens, create fire hazards, and in general create hazards dangerous to life and property, so as to constitute an imminent and inordinate peril to the welfare of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly further finds that lands that have been subjected to surface coal mining operations and have not been reclaimed and rehabilitated in accordance with modern standards constitute the aforementioned perils to the welfare of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly further finds that there are wide variations in the circumstances and conditions surrounding and arising out of surface coal mining operations due primarily to difference in topographical and geological conditions, and by reason thereof it is necessary, in order to provide the most effective, beneficial and equitable solution to the problem, that a broad discretion be vested in the authority designated to administer and enforce the regulatory provisions enacted by the General Assembly. The General Assembly further finds that governmental responsibility for regulating surface coal mining operations rests with state government and hereby directs the Energy and Environment Cabinet to take all actions necessary to preserve and exercise the Commonwealth’s authority, to the exclusion of all other governmental entities except the Commonwealth and agencies thereof and except as provided in KRS Chapter 100. Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to provide such regulation and control of surface coal mining operations as to minimize or prevent injurious effects on the people and resources of the Commonwealth. To that end, the cabinet is directed to rigidly enforce this chapter and to adopt whatever administrative regulations are found necessary to accomplish the purpose of this chapter.

       Acts 1980, ch. 209, § 6, provides: “The general assembly finds and declares that an emergency exists because of the federal requirement that state legislation necessary to comply with the provisions of Public Law 95-87, the “Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977”, be a validly enacted law on or before June 15, 1980, in order that the state program filing of March 3, 1980, be deemed complete, and that the state law shall be in effect before the United States Secretary of Interior can approve the state program, or the state’s proposed permanent program would otherwise be disapproved by the United States Secretary of Interior, thereby causing the installation of a federal program in the Commonwealth. Therefore, this legislation shall become a validly enacted law when signed by the governor [April 3, 1980], but the provisions of this Act shall not become effective until approval of the state program by the United States Secretary of Interior pursuant to Public Law 95-87, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.”

If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce the evidence in the hearings before the cabinet, the court may order that additional evidence be taken before the cabinet in such manner and upon such condition as the court may consider proper.

        The lowering of the required minimum bond for operators can only be effected on a case-by-case basis and with the utilization of the precise criteria outlined in subsection (9) (now subsection (11)) of this section. In such manner only can the legislative intent be implemented and no lowering of the bond as a general policy can be authorized.

      A surety upon receipt of a copy of a notice of noncompliance for failure to maintain contemporaneous reclamation issued to its insured, may notify the insured by certified mail, return receipt requested, that surety on any area disturbed after thirty (30) days from the effective date of the surety’s notice may be refused unless the violation is abated. A copy of such notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the cabinet, and shall become effective upon approval by the cabinet. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a notice of cancellation, the cabinet shall either accept a suitable substitute bond for the canceled area or shall amend the permit to delete the unbonded acreage or shall revoke the permit for lack of a bond. Proof of the abatement shall be documented by notice to the surety from the cabinet. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to relieve the surety of its liability for areas disturbed within the thirty (30) day notice period. The surety shall remain obligated for the full extent of the bond for reclamation of all areas disturbed prior to the cabinet’s approval of the cancellation.

        Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (Cabinet) properly denied a coal company’s application to renew the company’s coal mining permit because (1) a bona fide property dispute that the Cabinet could not adjudicate existed over the company’s right of entry to the subject land, due to the expiration of the company’s lease pursuant to a prior judgment, and (2) the Cabinet had no legal authority to adjudicate the property dispute, which could only be adjudicated by the court which issued the prior judgment.

     Protection and location of pollinator habitats on coal mine reclamation sites.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the reclamation of coal mine sites can benefit from pollinator habitat sites. These sites are an important conservation resource which will encourage and protect the habitat for pollinators like honeybees, bumble bees, and other bee species. The protection and location of pollinator sites situated on mine sites can increase the revegetation rates during the reclamation period which supports soil and hydrologic stability. Therefore, the General Assembly hereby directs the cabinet to develop a plan in conjunction with the Division of Conservation to encourage coal licensees to locate and protect pollinator sites on reclamation sites and to use high-value trees and shrubs to aid in pollen transfer.

       When any of the requirements of this chapter or administrative regulations adopted pursuant thereto or the orders of the cabinet have not been complied with, the cabinet shall forthwith cause a notice of noncompliance to be issued upon the permittee, person, or operator. The cabinet shall set forth in its notice a reasonable time period but not more than ninety (90) days for the abatement of the violation. If any permittee, person, or operator has not abated the violation within the time prescribed in the notice of noncompliance, the secretary or other authorized personnel of the cabinet shall issue to the permittee, operator, or person an order for immediate compliance and cessation of any mining activities or operations which are contributing to the violation. The order shall require the permittee, person, or operator to abate the violation in the most expeditious manner possible. The secretary is authorized to promulgate reasonable administrative regulations for the implementation of this section. The notice or order shall be handed to the person in charge of the operation and the operator or person engaged in coal exploration operations or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the permanent address shown on the application for a permit; or by electronic mail to the address shown on the permit application or otherwise voluntarily provided to the cabinet by the permittee on a form prepared by the cabinet; or, if no address is shown on the application, then by certified or electronic mail to the address known to the cabinet. The notice of noncompliance or order for immediate compliance and cessation shall specify in what respects the permittee, person, or operator has failed to comply with this chapter or the regulations or orders of the cabinet and the remedial action required, the period of time established for abatement, and a reasonable description of the portion of the surface coal mining and reclamation operation to which the notice or order applies. If the permittee, person, or operator has not reached an agreement with the cabinet or has not complied with the requirements set forth in the notice of noncompliance or order for immediate compliance and cessation within time limits set therein, the permit may be revoked or the operation terminated, after an opportunity for a hearing, by order of the cabinet, and the performance bond, if any, shall then be forfeited to the cabinet, provided that failure to attend a hearing shall be excused for good cause shown. Any bonding company or financial institution providing bond to the cabinet shall have the right to perform those measures necessary to secure bond releases if the bonding company or financial institution can demonstrate that it has the ability to perform the measures and will undertake to do so within a reasonable time frame. The bonding company, or financial institution providing the bond, may, at any stage of the reclamation process, pay the remaining encumbered balance of the bond and thereby discharge its obligation under the bond.

        The Court of Appeals, in a prior opinion, had stated that the issue of who was considered an “operator” under a mining permit, had to initially be litigated before the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet (NREPC); therefore, where the trial court simply failed to follow the Court of Appeals mandate which was the law of the case and failed to allow the issue to be resolved by proceedings before the NREPC, the trial court thereby committed reversible error.

        The remedy of bond forfeiture and the remedy of ordering a permittee to reclaim a site are not mutually exclusive; nothing in the statutes providing for forfeiture of bond if a reclamation violation is not abated, that authorize the cabinet to order that a permittee undertake certain abatement obligations or that authorize the cabinet to seek injunctive relief suggest that these remedies are intended to be mutually exclusive; on the contrary the cabinet’s ability to seek remedies of both bond forfeiture and injunctive relief afford it protection in those cases in which the amount of the bond is inadequate to pay for the cost of completing reclamation.

        Circuit court properly upheld the forfeiture of a mining company’s reclamation bonds and the revocation of its permit because the Energy and Environment Cabinet did not have to notify the bank that issued a letter of credit securing the bonds in order to allow the company to perform reclamation, the company made no attempt to obtain an easement by necessity, and the Cabinet followed proper procedures in the bond by providing uncontradicted testimony that reclamation had not been performed.

        The granting of permits in the first instance does not prevent the state from revoking those permits if it is determined subsequently that the permits were improvidently granted.

        Since there is considerable overlap in the conditions precedent to the issuance of a notice of violation or a notice of noncompliance, the choice of which of these enforcement tools to utilize upon discovery of a violation is largely committed to the department’s (now cabinet’s) discretion.

       <p>
        Since there is no time period given by statute for compliance with the requirement of this section, it would be reasonable for the department (now cabinet) to immediately issue a notice of noncompliance upon discovering a violation of such a requirement, rather than issuing a notice of violation and giving an opportunity to correct the violation.

     <ol>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc350s350.131ol11">
       When a bond for an interim or preinterim program permit was forfeited prior to July 15, 1988, by the cabinet, and the entire forfeited amount is not necessary to establish proper drainage and revegetation on the permit area for which it was submitted, the cabinet may use any remaining funds to supplement reclamation of other forfeited or released permit areas, if the other permit areas endanger public health and safety.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc350s350.131ol12">
       When the bond for an interim or permanent program permit is forfeited by the cabinet, and the entire forfeited amount is more than the amount necessary to complete reclamation, the unused funds less any interest that has accrued shall be returned to the party from whom they were collected, subject to the cabinet’s right to attach or set off the proceeds under other state laws.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc350s350.131ol13">
       Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or the provisions of KRS Chapter 45A, when the bond, other than a surety bond or bond secured by a letter of credit, for an interim or permanent program permit is forfeited and collected by the cabinet, and a person subsequently applies for a permit overlapping all or part of the disturbed area of the permit area for which the bond is forfeited, the cabinet may negotiate and enter into a contract with the applicant to reclaim the disturbed area overlapped in exchange for all or part of the forfeited bond funds held by the cabinet, if requested by the applicant. If the applicant proposes to overlap only a part of the disturbed area the cabinet may enter into a contract with the applicant to reclaim the overlapped part of the disturbed area if the cabinet has retained a portion of the forfeited bond that is sufficient for the cabinet to reclaim the part of the disturbed area that is not overlapped. Any applicant under this subsection shall not be eligible for the benefits available under this subsection if the applicant has any ownership or control connection with the permittee or operator with respect to which the bond was forfeited. The amount of forfeited bond funds the cabinet may pay to the applicant shall be determined by the cabinet based upon the estimated cost for the cabinet to reclaim the disturbed area overlapped to the reclamation standards applicable to the original permit, but not to exceed the forfeited bond amount collected and held by the cabinet. Payments under this subsection shall be made only after release of the bond pursuant to KRS 350.093(4)(a) for those areas of the overlapping permit that are covered by the contract. If the applicant obtains a permanent program permit overlapping a forfeited interim permit, any disturbances created in connection with the overlapping permit on areas that were disturbed under the forfeited interim permit may be covered by a contract under this subsection and shall be reclaimed to permanent program standards. Areas where coal is not removed under the overlapping permit and the disturbances are for reclamation of the interim permit only shall be reclaimed to interim program standards. If the applicant obtains a permanent program permit overlapping a forfeited interim permit, any disturbances created in connection with the overlapping permit on areas that were not disturbed under the forfeited interim permit shall not be covered by a contract under this subsection and shall be reclaimed to permanent program standards. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to exempt a person from the permitting, bonding, and reclamation requirements imposed in this chapter or to infringe upon the right of any surety to reclaim any permit or increment thereof to avoid bond forfeiture.

       <p>
        Where well water was contaminated due to mining activities, the mine’s owner and operator was required to provide the property owners with access to a clean water source even though the well water, without mine contamination, was already contaminated and unfit for most uses because the property owners could easily correct the pre-mining problems with cleaning and routine maintenance but, even with cleaning and maintenance, the sulfates from the mining operation would remain. Further, the requirement of KRS 350.421(2) to provide fresh water upon contaminating a water source did not require the replacement only of an uncontaminated water supply; although the well water was already unfit for drinking and other uses, it was undisputed that it was also contaminated from mining operations, and as such, the mine was liable for the provision of fresh, uncontaminated water.

       The impoundment dam construction will be so designed as to achieve necessary stability with an adequate margin of safety compatible with that of structures constructed under Public Law 83-566 (16 U.S.C. 1006);
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc350-reclamations350.455ol13">
       The quality of impounded water will be suitable on a permanent basis for its intended use and that discharges from the impoundment will not degrade the water quality below water quality standards established pursuant to applicable federal and state law in the receiving stream;
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc350-reclamations350.455ol14">

      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc350-reclamations350.455ol16">
       The water impoundments will not result in the diminution of the quality or quantity of water utilized by adjacent or surrounding landowners for agricultural, industrial, recreational, or domestic uses.

        The remedy of bond forfeiture and the remedy of ordering a permittee to reclaim a site are not mutually exclusive; nothing in the statutes providing for forfeiture of bond if a reclamation violation is not abated, that authorize the cabinet to order that a permittee undertake certain abatement obligations or that authorize the cabinet to seek injunctive relief suggest that these remedies are intended to be mutually exclusive; on the contrary the cabinet’s ability to seek remedies of both bond forfeiture and injunctive relief afford it protection in those cases in which the amount of the bond is inadequate to pay for the cost of completing reclamation.

        Where a federal act and its regulations provide for a procedure by which an accused strip miner is provided a formal hearing, with a full record, rights of examination, cross-examination, subpoenas, etc., and where from this full hearing there is an appeal to an administrative law judge and ultimately to the federal court system, by not providing a similar proceeding, the parallel Kentucky regulations are more stringent than the federal law and regulations, in violation of KRS 13A.120(1), thus making 405 KAR 7:090(4), which provides for a formal hearing only upon prepayment, null, void and unenforceable.

       Any permittee, person, or operator who violates any of the provisions of this chapter or administrative regulations promulgated pursuant thereto or who fails to perform the duties imposed by these provisions, except the refusal or failure to obtain a permit or other authorization as provided in this chapter, or who violates any determination or order issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be liable to a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for the violation, and an additional civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each day during which the violation continues, and in addition, may be enjoined from continuing the violations provided in this section. Any permittee, operator, or person who fails to abate a violation noted in a notice of noncompliance or an order for immediate compliance and cessation within the time period prescribed for the abatement shall be assessed a civil penalty of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) for each day during which the violation continues. Any person issued an order pursuant to KRS 350.130(4) shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation cited in the underlying notice of noncompliance issued therewith. No separate civil penalty shall be assessed for the order issued pursuant to KRS 350.130(4). Each day of continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessment. The cabinet shall develop a method for calculating monetary penalties and shall promulgate it as an administrative regulation. The secretary or a designated representative, upon his or her own initiative or upon written request received within fifteen (15) days after the cabinet mails its proposed penalty assessment, may waive the use of the method for calculating monetary penalties if he or she determines that, taking into account exceptional factors present in the particular case, the penalty is demonstrably unjust. The basis for every waiver shall be fully explained and documented in the records of the case. If the secretary or his or her designated representative waives the use of the formula, he or she shall determine the appropriate penalty upon consideration of the permittee’s history of previous violations at the particular surface coal mining operation, the seriousness of the violation, whether the permittee was negligent, and the demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation. The penalties shall be recoverable in an action brought in the name of the Commonwealth of Kentucky by the cabinet. The Franklin Circuit Court shall hold concurrent jurisdiction and venue of all civil and injunctive actions instituted by the cabinet for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or the orders and administrative regulations of the cabinet promulgated pursuant thereto. All sums recovered shall be placed in the State Treasury, except those moneys collected in excess of eight hundred thousand dollars ($800,000) in any fiscal year shall be deposited into the restricted fund account of the Office of the Commissioner of the Department for Natural Resources to be disbursed for the purposes set out in KRS Chapters 350, 351, and 352. All moneys previously deposited in the abandoned mine land enhancement fund shall be redeposited in the reclamation guaranty fund.

Failure to perform the in-kind work as agreed upon by the person or operator subject to the penalty assessment shall reinstate the liability of the person, permittee, or operator for the full amount of the assessed penalty.

        The language of subsection (9) of this section necessarily implies that the enforcement procedure provided for therein against the corporate officer “who willfully and knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out such
        . . . . .
        failure or refusal” shall be in Franklin Circuit Court because liability is predicated on failure by the corporate permittee to comply with the secretary’s “final order.” Chronologically, such failure can only occur after the administrative procedure against the corporation has culminated in an order that has been disobeyed.

        Subsection (9) of this section formed the basis for corporate permittee’s liability, not a piercing of the corporate veil, and did not require the naming of an individual, if the person is not the permittee, in the administrative proceeding as a prerequisite to the imposition of personal liability, only that a final order had been issued pertinent thereto and that there was a failure or refusal to comply before the individual entity could be held responsible.

        A complaint by the Natural Resources Environmental Protection Cabinet, in a case against the president and sole shareholder of a mining corporation, that specified that the defendant’s individual liability was as sole shareholder and president pursuant to subsection (9) of this section, provided adequate notice of the statutory basis for her liability without further parroting or paraphrasing the language within the statute.

        Notices of noncompliance, cessation orders, notice of proposed assessments and a form upon which the company could request an administrative hearing sent by certified mail to the corporate permittee and in several instances signed for by permittee’s father and business associate provided sufficient notice of the administrative orders and opportunity for hearing required by law and due process.

       <p>
        The remedy of bond forfeiture and the remedy of ordering a permittee to reclaim a site are not mutually exclusive; nothing in the statutes providing for forfeiture of bond if a reclamation violation is not abated, that authorize the cabinet to order that a permittee undertake certain abatement obligations or that authorize the cabinet to seek injunctive relief suggest that these remedies are intended to be mutually exclusive; on the contrary the cabinet’s ability to seek remedies of both bond forfeiture and injunctive relief afford it protection in those cases in which the amount of the bond is inadequate to pay for the cost of completing reclamation.

        The appellant was individually liable under subsection (9) where he was the sole officer, director, and shareholder of a corporation, he had notice of unabated violations by the corporation and related orders of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet, and he took no steps to see that the corporation complied with the orders.

        While any violation of KRS Chapter 350 or a regulation or order of the cabinet pursuant thereto gives rise to a penalty under this section, the notice of violation procedure can be viewed as an exercise of the agency’s discretion not to “prosecute” when the violation is not very serious and is corrected; the authority for the notice of violation provision is the Cabinet’s inherent discretion to mitigate penalties.

      While the Commissioner of the Department of Mines and Minerals can require monthly fire boss reports to be filed with the Department, if the Department requires that fire boss reports be received only from mine operators of mines located below the water table, then a relationship between mine safety and the need to impose different reporting requirements on mines below the water table as a class as opposed to mines above the water table must be shown to be reasonably related to the purpose of this statute so that such regulation will not be one prohibited by Ky.

        It is apparent that the purpose of subsection (3) (see now (4)(c)) of this section is to deny a mine license to an applicant who is a “delinquent taxpayer” as defined by KRS Chapter 131; therefore, it appears that such subsection authorizes the Department of Mines and Minerals to refuse a mine license to any applicant whose license has been previously revoked because of tax delinquencies as defined in KRS

      (7/12/2006).
    2006 Ky. Acts ch. 241, sec. 2, subsec. (7), provides: “A breath alcohol concentration of four tenths of a percent (.04) shall be the maximum acceptable level of concentration for participation in the examination and subsequent certification.” The words “four tenths of a percent” and the parentheses around “.04” were removed during codification to correct a manifest clerical error that occurred in the drafting process. Materials in the bill folder for House Bill 572 (which became
      2006 Ky. Acts ch. 241) show that the bill was drafted to be an exact copy of a bill requested and later introduced as Senate Bill 201, the initial proposed draft of which provided: “A breath alcohol concentration of .04 shall be the maximum acceptable level of concentration for participation in the examination(s) and subsequent certification(s).” Materials in the bill folder for Senate Bill 201 indicate that the erroneous phrase was inserted during the drafting process to conform with the rules for cardinal numbers set forth in the Bill Drafting Manual of the Kentucky General Assembly. The Reviser of Statutes has made this correction under the authority of
      KRS 7.136(1).

      No miner shall be required to operate any equipment or work in any condition which he reasonably believes to be unsafe.

The miner or his authorized representative and the company shall review the condition immediately and attempt to resolve the dispute. Should the miner not have an authorized representative, he may represent himself in the dispute. If the dispute is not settled by the company and the miner or his or her authorized representative, either party reserves the right to call in the commissioner or his authorized representative immediately and the dispute shall be settled on the basis of the inspector’s finding with a written copy of his finding given to the company and the miner and his authorized representative. In the event no representative of the miner exists, the employee shall have the right to have the dispute resolved based on the inspector’s findings. No disciplinary action shall be taken against a miner by a licensee unless the miner is found by the commissioner or his authorized representative to have acted in bad faith and without good cause in making an allegation as to unsafe equipment or working conditions.

      The General Assembly hereby finds and declares the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc351-minesafetyanalysiss351.241ol11">
       Thousands of Kentuckians enter underground mines each day to produce coal that is so vital to the economy of our nation and the well-being of its people.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc351-minesafetyanalysiss351.241ol12">
       The underground coal mine is a hazardous environment that constantly requires the highest degree of safety consciousness on the part of every individual.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc351-minesafetyanalysiss351.241ol13">
       Despite training and a variety of safety efforts, each year coal mines continue to take a heavy human toll: large numbers of miners are injured; many are left permanently disabled; and a lesser number pay the ultimate price—death.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc351-minesafetyanalysiss351.241ol14">
       Many activities are performed by a variety of persons; therefore, each coal miner is expected to learn and perform a large number of tasks.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc351-minesafetyanalysiss351.241ol15">
       Miners frequently become engaged in unfamiliar tasks when substituting for others or assisting a fellow worker.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc351-minesafetyanalysiss351.241ol16">
       The American zeal for work and productivity very frequently causes the miner to give second priority to normal safety measures and precautions.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc351-minesafetyanalysiss351.241ol17">
       Studies have demonstrated that experienced persons observing and providing on-the-job counseling to individual miners regarding their work habits can bring about a significant reduction in underground mine accidents and fatalities.

       A mine ventilation plan and any revision of an existing mine ventilation plan shall be suitable to the ventilation conditions and mining system of each mine. The mine ventilation plan and any revisions to the mine ventilation plan approved by the United States Mine Safety and Health Administration shall be submitted to the director or his or her authorized representative and incorporated into the license. All mine ventilation plans shall be set forth in printed form. The mine ventilation plan shall require the air quality throughout the mine to contain at least nineteen and one-half percent (19.5%) oxygen and not more than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of carbon dioxide, and the volume and velocity of the air current shall be sufficient to dilute, render harmless, and carry away flammable, explosive, noxious, and harmful gases and dust, smoke, and fumes. A copy of the mine ventilation plan and any revisions to that plan shall be available to the miners and their representatives.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc352s352.020ol12">
       The ventilation of all underground coal mines shall be produced by means of mechanically operated fans located outside the mine in fireproof housing and offset at least fifteen (15) feet to one (1) side or above the opening, protected by explosion doors or weak walls and arranged so that ventilating current may be reversed if necessary. The fan shall be installed so as to prevent recirculation of mine air. The main fan shall be operated from a power circuit independent from the mine circuit. If inside auxiliary fans are required to ventilate working places the commissioner must first approve the installation.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc352s352.020ol13">
       The licensee, superintendent, or foreman of every coal mine worked by shaft, slope, or drift shall provide and maintain for every mine two (2) separate and distinct escapeways, one (1) of which is vented by the intake air. However, if a mine was originally licensed prior to January 1, 1990, the commissioner may approve an alternate ventilation plan. Each active working section shall be ventilated by a separate split of intake air. In all mines the quantity of air passing through the last open crosscut between the intake and return in any pair or sets of entries shall be not less than nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute and as much more as is necessary to dilute and render harmless and carry away flammable and harmful gases. All working faces from which coal is being cut, mined, or loaded in a working section between the intake and return airway entries shall be ventilated with a minimum quantity of three thousand (3,000) cubic feet of air per minute and as much more as is necessary to dilute and render harmless and carry away flammable and harmful gases. The quantity of air reaching the last crosscut in pillar sections may be less than nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute if at least nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute is being delivered to the intake of the pillar line. The air current shall under any conditions have a sufficient volume and velocity to reduce and carry away smoke from blasting and any flammable or harmful gases.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc352s352.020ol14">
       All mines shall maintain at least nine thousand (9,000) cubic feet of air per minute at the points mentioned in subsection (3) of this section. The commissioner shall have the authority to require additional air in any mine when he deems it necessary for the safety of the employees.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc352s352.020ol15">
       When the air from a split has passed through and has ventilated all the working places in an air split of a mine it shall then be designated as return air. Return-air courses shall not be designated as primary escapeways.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc352s352.020ol16">
       As working places advance, breakthroughs for air shall be made not more than ninety (90) feet apart, except that where longwall or modern systems of mining are used the commissioner or his authorized representative may approve a greater distance between breakthroughs or the method of ventilating such longwall or modern systems of mining. If any breakthroughs between intake and return airways are not required for the passage of air or the travel of equipment, they shall be closed with stoppings. All permanent stoppings shall be substantially built with suitable incombustible or fire resistant material subject to the approval of the mine inspector so as to keep the working places well ventilated. All brattice cloth and ventilation tubing shall be flame resistant. Doors on the main haulways shall be avoided where practicable, and overcasts, built of concrete or other suitable material and of ample strength, shall be adopted. Where doors are used they shall be built in a substantial manner, and shall be hung so as to close automatically when unobstructed.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc352s352.020ol17">
       In a mine where methane can be found to an extent of one percent (1%) or more on the return of any one (1) split, the mine safety specialist, with the approval of the commissioner, may require the mine to be ventilated by the exhaust system, requiring the haulage roads and all feed wires to be located on the intake air and the electrical system to be so arranged that no wires carrying electrical current shall be on return air. A period of not more than ninety (90) days from date of notification shall be allowed to make the changes required.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXVIIIc352s352.020ol18">
       The ventilation plan shall require all fans utilized in the ventilation plan to be in continuous operation unless the fan must be turned off for repairs or maintenance, during which time all persons must be withdrawn from the mine. After the mine fan is restarted following the completion of repairs or maintenance, it must be in operation for a sufficient period to ensure air quality and the equalization of the mine atmosphere. Within fifteen (15) minutes after a fan has been unintentionally stopped, all miners must begin withdrawing from the mine. If the fan is restarted before the miners reach the surface, the miners shall remain at the point of their retreat, and the area inby shall be preshifted prior to the miners returning to the section.

       At all mines utilizing track haulage or transportation, there shall be developed a safe and uniform system of traveling through all switch points to prevent collisions. This system shall be designed in a manner which ensures that all persons can determine who has the right of way in all circumstances. Information concerning this system shall be included in annual retraining.

       No person shall be placed in charge of electrical face equipment in any mine unless he is a qualified person capable of determining the safety of the roof, face, and ribs of the working places and detecting the presence of explosive gas. Operators of electrical face equipment shall undergo an examination to determine their fitness to detect explosive gas and shall have a minimum of forty-five (45) days of actual mining experience before they are permitted to have charge of electric face equipment. Safety committeemen, shotfirers, and others whose duty may require them to make inspections for gas shall undergo and pass an examination or possess a mine foreman’s certificate before using an approved multi-gas detection device underground. The examination shall be given by the mine inspector. Blank forms for the examination shall be furnished by the department. A copy shall be retained on file at the mine office and the original shall be sent to the department fully made out and signed by the applicant and approved by the mine inspector.

       No electric face equipment shall be brought inby the last breakthrough next to the working face until the equipment operator has made an inspection for explosive gas using an approved gas detection device or instrument in the place where the equipment is to work unless the inspection is then made by some other competent person authorized and appointed for that purpose by the mine foreman. If any explosive gas in excess of one percent (1%) is found in the place, the electrical equipment shall not be taken in until the gas is removed.

       While the electric equipment is operating at the face, an examination for gas shall be made at not more than twenty (20) minute intervals. If methane gas is found in excess of one percent (1%) at any time, the power shall be de-energized from the equipment and left de-energized until the gas is reduced to less than one percent (1%) and the place determined safe by a foreman.

        In action by mine employee against employer for personal injury resulting from employee being struck by piece of metal flying off coal cutting machine, where sole issue presented by evidence was as to whether the machine was an unsafe appliance, it was prejudicial error for court to instruct jury as to duty of employer to employ a certificated mine foreman to visit the examine foreman to visit and examine working places daily, since mine foreman would have no duty to inspect coal cutting machine, and failure to employ foreman could not have been proximate cause of accident.

     <p>
      (7/14/2000). The phrase “with ink pencil” in the last sentence of subsection (2) of this statute appears to have resulted from a drafting error. In 2000 Ky. Acts ch. 104, secs. 21 and 25, the words “or indelible pencil” were deleted from the phrase “with ink or indelible pencil.” In Section 24 of that Act, however, only the words “or indelible” were deleted from the same phrase that appeared in this statute.
     </p>
     
     <p>
      (4/9/96). The action taken with respect to this statute by 1996 Ky. Acts ch. 308 was to have become effective April 8, 1996, under Section 51 of that Act. The Act, however, did not become effective until April 9, 1996, when the Governor’s signed copy of the Act was filed with the Secretary of State.

      (3/19/93) Although the phrase “ . . . . .

      . . . . . ” that appeared in the first sentence of this statute prior to the 1976 Regular Session of the General Assembly was changed by action at that session to read “ . . . . .
      failure to comply with the mining laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky
      . . . . . ”,
    see
    1976 Ky. Acts ch. 174, sec. 20, the text of the statute amended at 1976 (Extra. Sess.) Ky. Acts ch. 8, sec. 12, and later at 1978 Ky. Acts ch. 301, sec. 11, failed to incorporate this change. After first correctly printing the text as amended at the 1976 Regular Session, both publishers of the official editions unintentionally returned to part or all of the pre-1976 text by relying on the erroneous unamended text shown in the two later amendments to the statute. The publishers have been directed to alter the text of the first sentence of this statute in order to restore the relevant legislative action from the 1976 Regular Session that was inadvertently omitted in subsequent reprintings of this statute.

If the lessee fails to commence and complete the offset wells with diligence, the lease shall automatically expire and be void.

      It is clear that the legislature intended that the application be held without issuing a permit until the expiration of the five-day period to give the owner, operator or lessee of the coal-bearing stratum an opportunity to raise his objection before the drilling begins.

      There is necessarily implied authority in the statutes for the Department of Mines and Minerals to make objection on its own motion to a well location in applying its expertise for the safety of persons. However, the department, when acting pursuant to this section, must follow the time limitations therein provided both as to the five days for filing objection and as to the ten days for holding a hearing thereafter. Further, so long as the department, upon reasonable information and in good faith, takes the action provided for in this section, observing the time limitations, its officers could not be held liable for such action in a civil suit for damages. In the absence of such circumstances, the law makes the issuance of the permit mandatory.

      While the presence of active mine workings under the location or in proximity to it might increase the dangers to be encountered in drilling over coal-bearing strata, it does not affect the five-day waiting period required by this section which is mandatory in either event.

      When any well drilled through a workable coal bed is abandoned, it shall at that time be plugged to a point forty (40) feet below the lowest workable coal bed, in the following manner: The hole shall be filled with mud, clay or other nonporous material from the bottom to a point twenty (20) feet above the top of the lowest oil, gas or water-bearing strata, or a permanent bridge shall be anchored thirty (30) feet below its lowest oil, gas or water-bearing strata, and from this bridge it shall be filled with mud, clay or other nonporous material to a point twenty (20) feet above the strata, at which point there shall be placed a plug of cement or other suitable material that will completely seal the hole. Between this sealing plug and a point twenty (20) feet above the next higher oil, gas or water-bearing strata, the hole shall be treated in a like manner and at that point there shall be placed another suitable plug, that will completely seal the hole. In a like manner the hole shall be filled and plugged, or bridged, filled and plugged, with reference to each of its oil, gas or water-bearing strata. Whenever such strata are not widely separated and are free from water, they may be grouped and treated as a single productive stratum. After plugging all strata, a final plug shall be anchored approximately ten (10) feet below the bottom of the largest casing in the well and from that point to the surface the well shall be filled with mud, clay or other nonporous material.

      The interstate compact to conserve oil and gas was ratified, approved, and confirmed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the Governor directed to sign the Compact by joint resolution of the 1942 General Assembly (Acts 1942, ch. 267). Section 1 of the Compact was repealed, amended, and reenacted by joint resolution of the 1948 General Assembly, authorizing the execution of the Interstate Compact to conserve oil and gas and any renewal thereof within the Governor’s discretion (Acts 1948, ch. 288).

        The Department of Mines and Minerals has both the authority and the duty under this chapter to protect the public interest by promulgating and implementing reasonable regulations concerning the drilling of oil and gas wells through a gas storage zone.

       <p>
        When the Department of Mines and Minerals feels that an application is properly made to inject water in and around oil wells and that a maximum recovery can be had by the injection of such water, the Department may issue a permit allowing for secondary recovery or such other practice as may produce the greatest amount of oil from any one area and there would be no liability on the part of the Department for the issuance of such permits, if there was no negligence or intentional wrongdoing.

       <p>
        Any method of spacing oil wells is sufficient which satisfies the spacing requirements of this section and allows any encroachment to be determined under the circumstance with reasonable accuracy, according to accepted survey standards; whether a particular method is acceptable under the circumstances must be determined on the basis of opinion testimony from a qualified expert.

        The expert witness’ testimony was sufficient to support an inference that use of the circle method adequately insured compliance with the spacing requirements of this section. Howard v. Kingmont Oil Co., 729 S.W.2d 183, 1987

        It is not the responsibility of the Department of Mines and Minerals to assume the Herculean function of settling boundary disputes, particularly since any aggrieved party may bring an injunctive suit to enjoin the violation of this section and the proper resolution of a boundary dispute, in connection with the proper location of oil and gas wells, can only be undertaken by the courts, in the absence of private agreements. Accordingly, the procedure by which the Department examines the plat filed with the application and determines from the face of the plat whether or not the proposed well is located within the tolerances established by this section and issues a permit if the spacing and other requirements have been met is a proper and practical legal procedure which the courts would uphold.

       Upon the application of any operator in a deep well pool productive of oil or gas, or both, and other minerals which may be associated and produced therewith and after notice given by the commission to all persons reasonably known to own an interest in the oil or gas in the pool, and after a hearing conducted in accordance with KRS Chapter 13B, the commission may enter a final order requiring the unit operation of a pool or of any portion or combinations thereof within a field. The unit operation shall be in connection with a program designed to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells, or otherwise to prevent waste, or to increase the ultimate recovery of the unitized minerals by additional recovery methods. The final order shall provide for the unitization of separately-owned tracts and interests within the pool or pools, but only after finding that:

       The cabinet shall promulgate administrative regulations, pursuant to the provisions set forth in this chapter and to the extent possible, consistent with those promulgated pursuant to KRS Chapter 224, establishing formal and informal hearing procedures by which any hearing shall, upon the written request of the operator, permittee, or other person, be held in the Energy and Environment Cabinet’s Office of Administrative Hearings in Frankfort, before an impartial hearing officer who is independent of any prosecutorial functions of the cabinet. The administrative regulations shall provide for the conduct of hearings and investigations of any matter relating to this chapter. The procedures developed pursuant to this subsection shall provide that the hearings be held in the most expeditious manner possible within the time constraints established under this chapter. No person who presided at a prior hearing shall either preside at a subsequent hearing or participate in any further decision or subsequent administrative appeal in the same matter.

       Any party aggrieved by a final order of the secretary resulting from a hearing conducted pursuant to this section may appeal to the Franklin Circuit Court within thirty (30) days from the issuance of the final order. The party or parties affected by the final order shall file in the Circuit Court a petition, which states fully the grounds upon which a review is sought and shall assign all errors relied on. The cabinet shall be named respondent, and service shall be had on the secretary. Summons shall issue upon the petition directing the cabinet to send its entire record, properly bound, to the clerk of the Circuit Court after certifying that the record is its entire original record or a true copy. The record, when filed, shall become official and be considered by the Circuit Court on the review. After the case has been properly docketed in the Circuit Court, any party directly affected by the issues on appeal, may, upon notice to the parties, proper showing, and in the discretion of the court, be permitted to intervene. The court shall review the entire record and the findings and final order of the cabinet. No objection to the final order shall be considered by the court, unless the issue was raised before the cabinet or there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so. The findings of the cabinet as to the facts shall be prima facie evidence of the facts found therein. The court shall review the entire record and the findings and final order of the cabinet.

      <li id="tXXVIIIc353-oilandgasconservations353.700ol17">
       The court may stay the order until the court shall enter its decree. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a decree affirming or setting aside the order or remanding the cause with directions to modify the order so that it shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. Appeals may be taken by any party to the suit in the same manner and to the same extent as in other civil actions.
