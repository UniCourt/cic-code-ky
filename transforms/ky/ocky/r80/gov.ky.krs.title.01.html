      </h4>
      <p>
       The boundary of Kentucky is, for the most part, based on the original boundaries of Virginia, the state out of
    which Kentucky was carved. When Kentucky became a state in 1792 it was confined within the same limits as had bounded the western part of Virginia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The colony of Virginia was settled
    first in 1607, but the charter given it by the Crown was indefinite as to
    the western boundary of the colony, virtually nothing being known about the land west of the mountains. Virginia, in November, 1783, created out of Orange County a new county to be known as Augusta County, whose boundaries included
    the present State of Kentucky. It was to embrace all territory northwest of
    a line “to be run from the head spring of Hedgman River to the head spring of the river Potowmack.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Augusta County, Virginia, was divided
    in 1769, the western portion being known as Botetourt County; a few years
    later Fincastle County was split off from Botetourt, to include all of Botetourt
    County “within a line, to run up the east side of New River to the mouth of Culberson’s Creek, thence a direct line to the Catawba road, where it crosses
    the dividing ridge, between the north fork of Roanoke and the waters of New River, thence with the top of the ridge to the bent where it turns eastwardly, thence a south course, crossing Little River, to the top of the Blue Ridge of mountains.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The present eastern boundary of Kentucky corresponds roughly to that of Kentucky County, which was one of the three counties into which Fincastle was divided after Fincastle was abolished in 1776. Kentucky County lay south and west of a line running up the Big Sandy
    from the Ohio, and up the “northeasterly branch thereof to the Great
    Laurel Ridge or Cumberland Mountains”; then the line was to go along the mountains in a southwesterly direction until it struck the North Carolina line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Virginia originally owned the territory north of the Ohio, as well as what is now the area of the State of Kentucky. In 1784, Virginia deeded to the Congress of the United States the land north and northwest of the Ohio River, retaining the rest. Courts have interpreted the cession to mean that the boundary of the land kept by Virginia was not the center of the Ohio, but the low water mark on the northern or northwestern
    shores.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of the French and Indian War, Great Britain had acquired the land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, the Treaty of Paris fixing the boundary line between
    Spanish and British possessions as the middle of the Mississippi. The western boundary so established became
    ipso facto
    the boundary of Virginia, and, in 1783, was recognized by Great Britain as the western boundary of the United
    States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kentucky entered the union in 1792, and, by virtue of an Act of the Virginia legislature of 1789, known as the “Compact with Virginia,” succeeded to the boundary theretofore delimiting the western part of Virginia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The boundary here described is the result of a survey undertaken in 1799 and agreed to by commissioners appointed by the states of Kentucky and Virginia to ascertain the line. Their agreement
    was approved by the legislatures of both states, and the line as described
    therein was made the boundary.
      </p>
      <p>
       When West Virginia separated from Virginia and became a state in 1863, it took over the Kentucky boundary that formerly delimited Virginia on the west, insofar as that old Virginia boundary was the boundary of the new state. The entire eastern boundary of Kentucky on
    the one hand, and the two Virginias on the other, however, has not changed since 1799.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kentucky Act of approval contained a provision validating all land entries made in Virginia prior to October
    1, 1799 of lands lying in the forks of Sandy or east of the Cumberland Mountains
    on the waters of Sandy, and found by the survey to be in Kentucky. This provision
    has served its purpose and has been omitted.

       The 1784 deed of cession by Virginia applied only to land north and northwest of the Ohio River, and it has since been held that Kentucky jurisdiction extends to the low water mark on the north or northwestern shore. The part of the preceding description describing in detail a segment of the boundary between Indiana and Kentucky near Evansville was derived from an 1878 Act confirming the report of surveyors appointed
    by Kentucky and Indiana to run the true line between those states. The survey
    was made necessary by the fact that while in 1784 Green River Island in the Ohio River was within the Kentucky line, the river later changed its course,
    and the island became a part of the northern bank.

       In 1896 the United States Supreme Court in the case of
    Indiana v. Kentucky
    ,163 U.S. 520, 16 S. Ct. 1162, 41 L. Ed. 250 (1896) fixed the boundary line between the State of Indiana and the Commonwealth of Kentucky between certain terminal points but neglected to fix points where such terminal points reached the low water mark on the right side of the Ohio River forming the remainder of the boundary line between the states. A dispute arose as to the boundary line connecting said terminal points with said low water mark. Pursuant to negotiations carried on between Indiana and Kentucky the following Act (1942, ch. 116) was enacted by the General Assembly:
      </p>
      <p>
       “§ 1.
    That on and after the enactment of a similar and reciprocal law by the State

       Since the conditions necessary to make the Act effective have been met (Kentucky Acts 1942, ch. 116; Indiana Acts 1943, ch. 2; 57 Stat. 248 (1943)), the above description of the boundary line between Kentucky and Ohio, Illinois and Indiana has been substituted for the boundary line description derived from Carroll’s Statutes, 186m, 199 (1878,

        Long acquiescence by Ohio in Kentucky’s open claims over the river and a long line of cases by the United States Supreme Court and the courts of both Ohio and Kentucky for more than 150 years placed Ohio on notice and it is now foreclosed from claiming that its boundary with Kentucky lies in the middle of the Ohio River.

        Kentucky succeeded to the proprietorship of Virginia over the Ohio River to the low water mark on the northwestern shore; Kentucky can protect fish in the Ohio, and prosecute for violating its fishing laws one who is seining 100 yards south of the low water mark.

        Despite the cession of the Northwest Territory by Virginia in 1784, the jurisdiction of Virginia over the bank, bed and waters of the Ohio River remained intact and when Kentucky became a state, she succeeded to the rights of Virginia.

        The boundary between Kentucky and Missouri is the middle of the Mississippi River, as stipulated in the treaty between Great Britain, France and Spain in 1763. The line is the channel as it was then, and subsequent changes in the channel are of no effect. Wolf Island, in the Mississippi below Cairo, appears to have been east of the middle of the channel both in 1763, the date of the treaty, and 1820, the date when Missouri was
    admitted to the Union and its boundary fixed by the same line. Therefore the island belongs to Kentucky. Missouri v. Kentucky, 78 U.S. 395, 20 L. Ed. 116, 1870 U.S. LEXIS 1489 (U.S. 1871).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The above description comes from the report of commissioners who surveyed the entire Kentucky-Tennessee line in 1859 and 1860, and whose report was adopted by the General Assembly in 1860. This survey supersedes the old boundary as described in the Revised Statutes but was compiled for the first time in the 1944 Notes and Annotations to the Kentucky Revised Statutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The boundary described in all editions of the statutes from the Revised Statutes to Carroll’s Statutes, 1936 Edition, was that one which was run by commissioners Robert Trimble and John J. Crittenden, appointed by Kentucky, and Felix Grundy and William L. Brown, appointed by Tennessee, and which was ratified by Kentucky on February 11, 1820. The editor of Carroll’s Statutes stated in a note that for reasons unknown to him the boundary as run by the 1859-60 commissioners was omitted from the General Statutes, but he did not insert a description of the later boundary in his edition. He adds that he does not know wherein the two surveys differed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of the differences between these two boundaries was discussed by Judge A.M.J. Cochran in
    Hale & Ward v. Cook
    , (C.C.A. 1914) 213 F. 944. He, too, observed that compilations of Kentucky Statutes had contained only the earlier description of the boundary,
    and opined that the reason for the omission of the later description was that
    it was simply overlooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The older description declared the boundary from the Tennessee River to the Mississippi to be the line run by Alexander and Munsell in 1819, but contained no directions as to just where
    it should lie. For the most part, the line of Alexander and Munsell coincided with that of the 1859-60 commissioners, but one important difference must
    be noted. Alexander and Munsell had not run a straight, continuous line from the Tennessee to the Mississippi; a line run by them sixty-eight miles in a westerly direction from the Tennessee stopped just east of Reelfoot Lake,
    and a line also run by them extended 274 poles east from the Mississippi, and then came to an end. The 1859-60 commissioners bridged the gap by joining
    these two lines by a diagonal straight line, which they considered the state boundary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The line between Virginia and North Carolina was declared in the charter of Charles II to be the parallel 36° 30´. A survey conducted in 1779 and 1780 to ascertain the exact location of the line resulted in Walker’s line, which ran from Cumberland Gap to the Tennessee River. In time, however, it was learned that in fact Walker’s line
    ran north of 36° 30´, though it continued to be used as the boundary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act of 1820, adopting the report of Crittenden, Trimble, Brown and Grundy, describes the line briefly, merely stating that it follows Walker’s line to the Tennessee River, and Alexander’s and Munsell’s from the Tennessee on. An act of November 22, 1821, adopts and ratifies a survey made in that year, by William Steele and Absalom Looney, of the Tennessee line to a point west of the Cumberland River; this survey goes into considerable detail, and has been used by all compilers up to, and including, Baldwin. For reasons not known, however, the Steele and Looney description was always printed as if it were part of the Act of 1820.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true and accurate boundary between Kentucky and Tennessee, nevertheless, is that laid out by the commissioners of 1859-60 and adopted by the General Assembly of 1860 (ch. 816, § 1). That description was reproduced in the 1944 edition of Notes and Annotations to the Kentucky Revised Statutes, supplemented by a portion of section 190 of Carroll’s Statutes in regard to the Tennessee River as the boundary. It
    is again so reproduced in this edition. No attempt has been made to compare the boundary of Steele and Looney with that of the 1859-60 commissioners, because while the former employed geographical terms with which inhabitants of the neighborhood might be familiar, e.g. Hackle Knob, Bear Creek and Little South Fork, the latter used technical surveyors’ words of art. Should there be any conflict between the two descriptions, that of the 1859-60 commissioners would prevail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agreement of commissioners Trimble and Crittenden, of Kentucky, and commissioners Grundy and Brown, of Tennessee, which agreement was ratified by the General Assembly on February 11, 1820, contained one article providing a method of making future joint surveys of the boundary (Carroll’s Statutes, § 191), four articles relating to lands lying along the new boundary as they had run it (Carroll’s Statutes,
    §§ 192, 193, 194 and 195), one article providing that the agreement should be liberally construed to effect the objects contemplated (Carroll’s Statutes, § 196), and one article pledging the faith of Kentucky to enact future legislation necessary to carry the agreement into effect (Carroll’s Statutes, § 197). These articles do not have sufficient modern importance to justify their being set forth here at length, but a brief summary of their provisions follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 3 provided that whenever the governor of either state deems it expedient to have the boundary between the two states east of the Tennessee River, or any part thereof, run and plainly
    marked, he shall notify the governor of the other state and two surveyors shall then be appointed for that purpose, one by each governor. The surveyors
    are given power to employ necessary assistants, and are directed to survey
    and mark the line and submit duplicate plats and reports to the governor of
    each state, to be deposited and preserved in the office of the secretary of
    state. The expenses of the survey are to be borne equally by both states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 4 declared void all claims to lands west of the Tennessee River and north of Alexander’s and Munsell’s
    line that had been derived from North Carolina or Tennessee, and to lands
    west of the river and south of that line, which had been derived from Virginia
    or Kentucky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 5 provided that all lands vacant
    and unappropriated by any person claiming to hold under the states of North Carolina or Tennessee, as of February 11, 1820, and not thereafter appropriated, east of the Tennessee River, and north of the parallel of latitude 36° 30´ north, are the property and subject to the disposition, of the State
    of Kentucky, and that any grant made by Kentucky after February 11, 1820,
    of any part thereof, shall be received in evidence in the courts of Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 6 stated that claims to lands east of the Tennessee River, between Walker’s line and 36° 30´ derived
    from Virginia in consideration of military service, should not be prejudiced by the establishment of Walker’s line as the boundary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 7 validated titles between Walker’s line and 36° 30´ from the Cumberland River, near the mouth of Obey’s River, to the southeastern corner of Kentucky whether derived from
    Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina or Tennessee. Kentucky and Tennessee reserved the power of carrying into grant, claims not then perfected; should there be any conflicting claims, the validity of each claim was to be tested by
    the law of the state whence it emanated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 8 provided that the agreement should be liberally construed, and that in case of a disagreement, two disinterested arbitrators should be selected to settle the dispute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 9 pledged the faith of Kentucky and Tennessee that they will pass such further laws as might be necessary
    to effectuate the agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The text of the original agreement can be found in the Acts of 1820 and in previous statute compilations.

       <p>
        Alexander and Munsell, who surveyed the Kentucky-Tennessee boundary west of the Tennessee River in 1819, did not run a straight, continuous line from the Tennessee to the Mississippi River. They ran a line 68 miles west of the Tennessee, and then stopped; they also ran a line 274 poles east from the Mississippi, but no further. These two lines were joined in the survey of the Joint Boundary Commission of 1859-60. Otherwise, the line of the Commission conformed rather closely to the line of Alexander and Munsell.

        Where contract, made a part of a divorce decree, for child support, provided for maintenance payments until the child attained majority and was entered into in 1951, it required payments until the child became 21 years old, notwithstanding the fact that this section became effective in
    1965. Wilcox v. Wilcox, 406 S.W.2d 152, 1966<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS192" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 192</a></cite> (Ky. 1966); (contract made in 1962).

        In proceeding commenced after adoption of this section to compel divorced father to support his children, court in absence of a legal contract had no authority to compel support for children over 18.

        Where a separation agreement stated that support payments for an adopted son were to continue “until further orders of the court” and the legislature subsequent to the making of the agreement reduced the age of majority from 21 to 18, an order terminating the support payments when the son reached 18 was proper since there was no contractual intent that the payments continue to age 21.

      </h4>
      <p>
       A Daniel Walker cigarette package similar to the official seal of the State of Kentucky could be used as a trademark because the design omitted the words “Commonwealth of Kentucky” which are required to be on the seal.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG71-79" target="_blank">OAG 71-79</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A written opinion of the office of the Attorney General of Kentucky that a design was not a prohibited replica of the seal of Kentucky would be a sufficient declaration of the right to use the design.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG71-79" target="_blank">OAG 71-79</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the higher education assistance authority is not a private concern seeking to use the Commonwealth’s seal for private or commercial purposes, and the insignia circle would merely show that the department is an agency of the Commonwealth and the scholar’s head and initials in the center would merely identify and distinguish the agency’s publications from those of all other agencies of the Commonwealth without misrepresentation, false, misleading or deceptive acts, or questionable practices, there is no statutory prohibition against the authority using such seal.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG75-172" target="_blank">OAG 75-172</a></cite>.
