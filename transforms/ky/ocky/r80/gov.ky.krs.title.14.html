     </h3>
     <p>
      There is established a public library facilities construction fund to assist local libraries with debt service payments for new library facilities and library improvements. The Department for Libraries and Archives is authorized to enter into long-term written memoranda of agreement with local libraries or other governing bodies to assist in debt service payments relating to library construction or renovation projects. The agreements shall specify the rights, duties, and obligations of both the local public library, or other governing body, and the department. The department shall promulgate administrative regulations to establish the application process, criteria for selecting projects for assistance, a minimum level of local participation, and the process to be followed in the construction of facilities. The department shall report assistance awards to the Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue within thirty (30) days of execution of any memorandum of agreement.

       The executive committee, while responsible for the execution of the duties and functions conferred upon it and resulting from the properly adopted rules and regulations of the commission, is not empowered with the rule and regulation making responsibility. OAG 73-498.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kentucky Heritage Commission (now Heritage Council) is a separate administrative body and agency of state government, and is authorized to adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary and incidental to the performance of the Commission’s duties and functions. OAG 73-498.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although executive order 71-59 dated December 23, 1971 was not approved, by express statute or appropriation, by the General Assembly at its next session, the General Assembly, by repealing in 1972 KRS §§ 42.210 to 42.290, abolished the office of state curator and approved by implication the executive order, and the duties and responsibilities formerly exercised by the curator are now vested in the commission and its executive director. OAG 75-80.
      </p>
      <p>
       Executive order 72-869 dated September 18, 1972 which designated the executive director of the commission as state liaison officer (now state historic preservation officer) and the commission as the agency to implement the National Historic Preservation Act (16 USCS §§ 461-470n) in Kentucky did not bring about a reorganization of state government, and did not, therefore, require the approval of the General Assembly, by express statute or by appropriation, at its next session and is still in full force and effect. OAG 75-80.
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc13s13.080" target="_blank">13.080</a></cite> (repealed) the commission is not required to adopt rules and regulations unless it pursues a policy or procedure affecting the general public or a segment thereof. OAG 75-80.

      <p>
       The commission has policy making responsibility in adopting rules for its own operations and for the expenditure of its own funds, which are subject to the general provisions of the statutes governing financial administration of all state agencies. OAG 75-80.

      <p>
       The Kentucky Heritage Commission (now Heritage Council) is a separate administrative body of state government and should coordinate activities with other departments which may be expending funds on conservation, archaeological, economical, historic landmarks and other matters related to the commission’s functions and projects and also is advisory to the Governor on executive actions, legislative matters and in passing on the budget of the Commission and the budgets of other departments upon which the Commission’s advice might be sought. OAG 75-80.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no binding legal relationship between the Heritage Commission (now Heritage Council) and the Washington, Kentucky Historic Township Commission created by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc171s171.385" target="_self">171.385</a></cite> but they should coordinate their efforts and the Heritage Commission, if asked, acts in an advisory but not a supervisory capacity to the Washington Commission. OAG 75-80.

      <p>
       This section calls for the creation and preparation of at least two inventory lists of historic resources, one containing landmarks of national significance and the other containing landmarks of statewide significance and each list should be divided into two sections, one section listing landmarks of greatest significance and the other those of lesser significance. OAG 75-80.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where meeting of the commission held without a quorum, action taken at such a meeting is of no effect and the minutes should reflect that no meeting could be held for that reason. OAG 75-80.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the Kentucky Heritage Commission (now Heritage Council) serves in an advisory capacity, the Commission does not have power of review over the decisions and projects of the University of Kentucky Department of Anthropology which has the ultimate authority regarding archaeological permits. OAG 76-178.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to prevent misuse of the files of the Kentucky Heritage Commission (now Heritage Council) which contain detailed information about historic buildings and sites by “pot hunters” who are trying to locate archaeological sites which they can dig and loot which will destroy such sites for scientific study and by thieves and vandals who may utilize the files on privately owned historic buildings as a shopping list, the Commission is legally authorized to adopt regulations which will prevent public inspection of specific portions of its files under subdivisions (a), (g) and (h) of subsection (1) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878" target="_blank">61.878</a></cite>.

       Neither the interested person nor his representative has the right to reproduce the records of a district board of education by any photostatic means whatsoever. OAG 68-291.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither an interested person nor his representative has the absolute right to take the original records of a district board of education into a private room without the secretary or the secretary’s representative being present. OAG 68-291.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the necessary interest is present, the interested person or his representative is entitled to obtain a certified copy of the contract between the board of education and the secretary upon payment of such reasonable fee therefor as may be prescribed by regulation of the district board. OAG 68-291.

       Information concerning textbook titles and course enrollment requested by a private bookstore would be a part of the university’s records and would be subject to the statutory privilege of inspection by any interested person. OAG 69-24.

       Disposal of municipal records is subject to the rules and regulations of the Archives and Records Commission. OAG 69-108.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the daily “minute sheets” of the clerks of the circuit Court contain no information which is not being permanently preserved elsewhere in the Circuit Court’s records, their destruction, once the official orders have been taken from them, would constitute neither a criminal act under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc519s519.060" target="_blank">519.060</a></cite> nor an infringement on the authority of the State Archives and Records Commission under this section. OAG 75-103.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is apparent from the 1982 amendment to subdivision (1) of this section, which added cards, tapes, disks and recordings to the definition of “records,” that it was the intent of the legislature to facilitate the maintenance of public records by modernizing the means of preserving those records; therefore, it appears that Kentucky law does permit Kentucky State University to maintain its records via microfilm microfiche. OAG 83-161.

       The fiscal court should provide sufficient space to store case reports, evidence from death scenes, photographs and autopsy reports for the period of usefulness to the coroner in carrying out his work; since there is no statute expressly dealing with the retention time or final disposal, in the absence of a court order, or the applicable storage of such records by State Archives, the coroner should use his good judgment in disposing of items no longer needed.

       A county desiring to destroy or dispose of records must do so in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Archives and Records Commission, and in the absence of such rule or regulation must secure prior approval of the Commission. OAG 60-835.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disposal of municipal records is subject to the rules and regulations of the archives and Records Commission. OAG 69-108.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where records have not been unlawfully removed but are threatened with an unauthorized transfer, the department may enjoin their removal. OAG 78-519.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the Open Records Act does not regulate management practices of keeping public records and since the Attorney General’s decisions are limited to whether a requested document is in the possession of a public agency and whether such document is subject to public inspection, the request that university, in not identifying one person as the official custodian in charge of enforcing proper records keeping practices, be charged with violating the Open Records Act, as well as the request for provision of a copy of the contract of the person thought to be the official custodian of the university’s records, were denied. OAG 94-ORD-8.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the Attorney General may be called on to intervene in the recovery of records when it comes to the attention of the Department for Library and Archives that those records are threatened with unlawful removal, defacing, alteration, or destruction pursuant to this section, he is not empowered to issue a legally enforceable decision relative to those acts; his decisions under the Open Records Act are limited to the question of whether the agency violated the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.870" target="_blank">61.870</a></cite> to<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.884" target="_blank">61.884.</a></cite> OAG 94-ORD-12.

       The University of Kentucky subverted the intent of the Open Records Act, which is essentially related to the intent of the State Archives and Records Act, by failing to develop an adequate program for ensuring records management through agency oversight of employee records handling practices; and by failing to develop a coherent scheme for the organized maintenance of records at identified maintenance locations. OAG 94-ORD-121.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since July 15, 1994, when the amendments to the Open Records Act took effect, there is a higher standard of review relative to denials based on the nonexistence, or the destruction, of the requested records. In order to satisfy its statutory burden of proof, a public agency must, at a minimum, document what efforts were made to locate the missing records. Because the agency failed to provide even a minimal explanation for the loss of the requested records, the agency failed to adequately manage its records. OAG 94-ORD-141.

       Income to the Circuit Court Clerk as county law librarian should be included in fees of the office for the purpose of social security coverage. OAG 63-880.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court could validly raise that portion of the circuit clerk’s salary that constituted his salary as law librarian after his term of office had begun. OAG 66-412.
      </p>
      <p>
       The salary payment of not less than $50.00 nor more than $100 per month for a librarian is mandatory. OAG 67-369.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Circuit Court Clerk as ex officio librarian of the county law library can receive the salary stipulated in this section in addition to his compensation as clerk which cannot exceed $15,667.20 per annum. OAG 75-134.
      </p>
      <p>
       The circuit clerk is ex officio the librarian of the county law library, his duties as librarian may not be delegated to an outsider but may be performed by a regular deputy circuit clerk, and his salary as librarian is official income and must be counted as a part of his fees in considering his maximum statutory compensation. OAG 75-573.
      </p>
      <p>
       On and after January 2, 1978, the law librarian’s salary will have to be paid out of the county treasury, and if the librarian’s salary, when considered as a part of the circuit clerk’s total compensation, exceeds the rubber dollar maximum for circuit clerks, the excess money will have to be turned over to the Department for Finance and Administration (now Finance and Administration Cabinet). OAG 77-270.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consumer price index formula adjustment of the circuit clerk’s compensation is only applied against the monetary level set forth in the state Constitution and does not operate on any statutory fees, salaries or statutory limits. OAG 77-482.
      </p>
      <p>
       A plan whereby a county law library would be housed in a university library 300 yards from the county courthouse, where the Circuit Court Clerk would receive new books, keep records of books received, take inventory, and deliver books to the library to be stored in the reference section to be available to all, but checked out only by officials and attorneys, is in substantial compliance with this section. OAG 79-270.
      </p>
      <p>
       The duties of the county law librarian generally cannot be delegated to others, however, since under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.035" target="_blank">61.035</a></cite> a deputy clerk may perform any act permitted to be done by the principal ministerial officer, the circuit clerk may designate one or more of his deputy clerks to assist in the librarian function, where necessary. OAG 80-423.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the circuit clerk has the positive duty to serve as the county law librarian, he is implicitly required to provide any personnel necessary to assist him in performing properly the function of county law librarian; this statutory responsibility really falls on the office of circuit clerk, regardless of who is clerk and thus the office staff (the clerk through use of his deputies) are held responsible for the librarian function. OAG 80-517.
      </p>
      <p>
       The librarian’s salary is not subject to indexing under the Consumer Price Index, since this section makes no provisions for indexing. OAG 82-177.
      </p>
      <p>
       The payment of the librarian’s salary is mandatory since this section says “shall receive.” OAG 82-177.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no constitutional problem with subsection (1) of this section, which makes the circuit clerk the ex officio law librarian, except that the county law librarian function must not interfere with the clerk’s court functions as envisioned in Const., § 114 and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc30As30A.010" target="_blank">30A.010</a></cite>; the circuit clerk is entitled to receive a salary from the county treasury, as a properly budgeted item under KRS Ch. 68, for actually serving as the ex officio librarian of the county law library and the salary provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.055" target="_blank">64.055</a></cite> (repealed) relate solely to the work of the clerk as Circuit and District Court Clerk. OAG 82-177.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where two successive circuit clerks performed the duties of county law librarian without compensation, the fiscal court might be required by a court to make up those payments, under the salary established pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, but within the five-year statute of limitation, pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc413s413.120ol12" target="_blank">413.120(2)</a></cite>. OAG 82-177.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the maximum salary, as set forth in Const., § 246 and indexed under the consumer price index concept, must apply to the same person for public services, regardless of whether such services are rendered in one position or more than one, the circuit clerk can accept the salary as law librarian, provided that the regular clerk’s salary and the library salary in the aggregate do not exceed the rubber dollar maximum for the particular year. OAG 82-177.
      </p>
      <p>
       The monthly salary of the clerk as ex officio librarian must be fixed by the fiscal court, payable out of the county treasury. OAG 83-75.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compensation for the librarian function, when added to what the circuit clerk receives as circuit clerk, cannot exceed the rubber dollar limit for each particular year. OAG 83-75.
      </p>
      <p>
       The circuit clerk is the ex officio librarian of the county law library and that function cannot legally be delegated to another person, except that the circuit clerk can delegate the clerk’s librarian function to the clerk’s deputies under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.035" target="_blank">61.035</a></cite>. OAG 83-75.
      </p>
      <p>
       Salary paid to a Circuit Court clerk by a county fiscal court, for such officer’s services as ex officio county law librarian, cannot be lawfully credited in relation to a clerk’s Kentucky Employees Retirement System account, as such salary is not “creditable compensation” within that system. OAG 93-75.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit Court Clerk, as a part-time worker as ex officio county law librarian, was not eligible to have the salary for part-time work credited in relation to the County Employees Retirement System (CERS). OAG 94-45.
      </p>
      <p>
       Payment to the Circuit Court Clerk for part-time work as ex officio county law librarian did not constitute “creditable compensation” within the meaning of applicable statutes; moreover, there is no provision authorizing purchase of credit for part-time service as ex officio county law librarian. OAG 94-45.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where circuit clerk who took office in January 1995, in addition to her salary as circuit clerk, and as required by this section, received a monthly salary for her duties as county law librarian of $75, a reduction of such salary to $50 per month in July, 1995 was illegal since it is illegal to increase a clerk’s salary as law librarian during his term, in violation of Const. §§ 161 and 235, it is also illegal to decrease it. OAG 96-35.

     Issuance of library bonds.

     <p>
      The board of trustees may, in its discretion, issue bonds in the sum of not over one million dollars ($1,000,000) for the purpose of making improvements or repairs, or paying off any indebtedness it may owe. The bonds may be secured by any or all real or personal property owned by the library. The bonds shall be designated as “library bonds” and the board of trustees shall, by resolution, fix the date and maturity of the bonds, the rate of interest and form they shall bear, and where they shall be payable. The board shall determine when, at what price and how the bonds shall be sold. As the bonds are sold their proceeds shall be placed in some bank, but shall be kept in a separate account and shall be used only for the purpose for which the bonds were issued, provided however the expense and cost of floating the bonds may be paid therefrom. The rent received in any year from any real property belonging to the board of trustees shall be first applied to the payment of interest on bonds for such year, and next to the sinking fund requirements of the bond issue for such year, and the balance may be used for current operating expenses of the board of trustees.

       Upon receipt of a petition signed by a number of taxpayers equal to five percent (5%) of the number of votes cast for officers in the last general election of such governmental unit, the legislative body shall submit the question to a vote at the next general election by submitting the question to the county clerk not later than the second Tuesday in August preceding the general election. If a majority of those voting on the question vote in favor of the proposition, the legislative body shall forthwith establish a library, except as provided in subsection (4) of this section.

        The roll-back provisions of KRS Ch. 132 apply to tax levies to maintain public libraries. Under KRS Ch. 132, a taxing district’s revenue from ad valorem taxes is limited; this chapter has the effect of rolling back the tax rate to maintain a constant revenue. Taxes levied to support a library created under this section or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.450" target="_self">173.450</a></cite> would have to comply with KRS Ch. 132; however, where the library is not maintained by a tax levy, but by appropriation of funds from the local government, this section does not mandate a levy to maintain libraries created thereunder.

The library tax must be included in the city’s general tax levy and the city’s legislative body establishes the library tax, under the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.360" target="_self">173.360</a></cite>, at a rate which cannot be lower than five cents, subject to the rollback provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132s132.027" target="_blank">132.027</a></cite>. OAG 68-320.

       KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132s132.023" target="_blank">132.023</a></cite> does not apply to a county library established under this section. OAG 69-394.
      </p>
      <p>
       The minimum annual appropriation by the fiscal court for a library established under this section is five cents on each $100 worth of property assessed for local taxation including net assessment growth. OAG 69-394.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where libraries were established under this section, prior to the 1965 rollback legislation, the city or county which established such libraries must reduce its respective library tax to the applicable compensating tax rate, or restricted budget, regardless of whether that rate or revenue would be less than five cents on the hundred. OAG 69-590.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney General Opinions 68-84 and 70-327 may be distinguished although both are construing subsection (2) of this section, as the voters of Barren County in 1954 voted to establish not only a library service but also a concomitant tax levy which should be made in addition to the regular county general tax levy, while the 1956 Allen County vote was only an acknowledgment of the voters’ desire for library services so that any library appropriation must necessarily come out of the general county tax levy. OAG 73-291.
      </p>
      <p>
       The revenue sharing fund belonging to the city and county may be spent for the categories selected by the board, as necessity demands. OAG 73-400.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the library was created under this section or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.450" target="_self">173.450</a></cite>, it would come within the term “other municipality” of Const., § 165, a member of the board of trustees would be a municipal officer, and under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.260" target="_blank">61.260</a></cite> (repealed), there would be a conflict of interest if a law firm accepted employment from the library board where a member of the law firm was a member of the library board of trustees when the contract was made and such member might receive benefit as a result of the contract. OAG 74-95.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislative body of any governmental unit may contract on its own initiative to receive service from the State Department of Libraries (now Department for Libraries and Archives), and this would include an agreement for a bookmobile. OAG 80-570.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a library is established, the legislative body may appropriate moneys from the general tax revenues or the question of a tax rate may be submitted to the voters as a special levy in addition to the existing property tax; thus, where it appeared that a city had made an appropriation, the appropriation had to come from the general tax revenues of the city. OAG 84-27.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The establishment of a regional library shall be by contract, in writing, by the legislative bodies of the counties. The expenses of the regional library shall be apportioned between the contracting parties concerned in proportion to the taxable property of each as shown by their respective assessments and as shall be agreed upon in the contract. The treasurer of one of the counties, as provided in the contract, shall have the custody of the funds for the regional library; and the treasurers of the other counties concerned shall transfer to him as collected all the moneys received for public library purposes and interest from library funds in their respective governmental units. The contract for a regional library shall continue in force for a period of five (5) years and no county shall be permitted to withdraw without the consent of all the other participating counties during the five (5) year period. If the legislative body of a county decides to withdraw from a regional library contract, it shall be entitled to a division of the property on the same basis as its contributions, such division being completed within six (6) months from the withdrawal date. If no unit withdraws, at the end of the five (5) year period, the contract shall continue in force for a like period.

      A contract for library service made pursuant to subsection (4) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite> shall require the existing library to perform all the functions of a library within the governmental unit wanting service.

    The management and control of a library shall be vested in a board of trustees. In cities and counties, the board shall consist of five (5) members except that in cities with populations equal to or greater than twenty thousand (20,000) based upon the most recent federal decennial census, it shall consist of seven (7) members. In the event a contract for library service is made pursuant to subsection (4) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite>, the board may consist of equal representation from the contracting parties with the total membership not to exceed twelve (12).

    Within thirty (30) days after the establishment of a library has been authorized by any of the methods authorized by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite>, a library board shall be appointed. In cities the trustees shall be appointed by the mayor and in counties they shall be appointed by the county judge/executive. There shall be established a board of trustees in each regional library district for purposes of coordinating library programs and effecting economies and efficiencies of the member county library systems. In each regional library district, the trustees shall be appointed by the joint action of the judges/executive of the respective counties or as may be agreed upon by contract. In any region in which there are four (4) or less counties, provision shall be made in the contract for rotation of members and an equitable adjustment of terms. If a region consists of an even number of counties, the trustees appointed by the judges/executive of the respective counties shall appoint an additional trustee whose term of office shall be four (4) years and whose successor shall be appointed by the trustees in office at the time of expiration of such term. Trustees shall be appointed from the governmental unit at large with special reference to their fitness for such office. Upon initial establishment of the board, members of the board shall be appointed to terms as follows: two (2) members for two (2) years, one (1) member for three (3) years, and two (2) members for four (4) years respectively, and thereafter trustees shall be appointed to serve terms of four (4) years. Trustees may serve for two (2) consecutive terms after which they shall not succeed themselves. They may be reappointed no earlier than twelve (12) months following the end of their last service. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired terms as soon as possible in the same manner as the original appointments. In the event that vacancies have existed for a period of at least six (6) months, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, upon the recommendation of the state librarian, may make such necessary appointments. After absence of a trustee from four (4) regular monthly meetings of the board during any one (1) year of the trustee’s term, the trustee shall be considered to have automatically resigned from the board. An advisory board may be appointed and serve as specified in bylaws of the public library board of trustees.

No board shall employ as a member of its library staff any member of the board or any person related closer than a second cousin to any member of the board.

The treasurer of the library board shall be required to execute bond with good and sufficient surety thereon for the faithful performance of his duties, the amount of the bond to be fixed by the board. If the bond has a corporate surety the premium shall be paid from the library fund. The board shall have exclusive control of expenditures, subject to an examination of accounts as may be required by the legislative body, and money shall be paid only upon vouchers approved by the board. The board shall not make expenditures or incur indebtedness in any year in excess of the amount of money appropriated and available for library purposes, except where a library board is the owner of real estate not used for library purposes, in which case they may borrow money secured solely by that property. Principal and interest on indebtedness on real estate owned by a library board not used for library purposes is not chargeable to the library funds derived from taxation.

        The roll-back provisions of KRS Ch. 132 apply to tax levies to maintain public libraries. Under KRS Ch. 132, a taxing district’s revenue from ad valorem taxes is limited; this chapter has the effect of rolling back the tax rate to maintain a constant revenue. Taxes levied to support a library created under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite> or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.450" target="_self">173.450</a></cite> would have to comply with KRS Ch. 132; however, where the library is not maintained by a tax levy, but by appropriation of funds from the local government, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite> does not mandate a levy to maintain libraries created thereunder. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government v. Hayse, 684 S.W.2d 301, 1984 Ky. App. LEXIS 586 (Ky. Ct. App. 1984).

       A city can appropriate money annually for library services by a special levy if the constitutional limit has not been reached or the money can be appropriated from the general fund. OAG 64-250.
      </p>
      <p>
       The special library tax levy must be included in determining the maximum tax levy permitted under Const., § 157. OAG 64-250.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city is legally authorized to appropriate public funds to the library board to pay various employees in the operation and control of the library. OAG 68-129.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1) of this section, which establishes the minimum tax rate which may be imposed by a municipality for library services, is subject to the compensating tax rate provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132s132.027" target="_blank">132.027</a></cite>, even when the compensating tax rate would require a tax levy that is less than the minimum established by this section. OAG 68-259.
      </p>
      <p>
       A library created under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite> is not a separate taxing district. The library tax must be included in the city’s general tax levy and the city’s legislative body establishes the library tax, under this section, at a rate which cannot be lower than five cents, subject to the rollback provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132s132.027" target="_blank">132.027</a></cite>. OAG 68-320.
      </p>
      <p>
       The minimum annual appropriation by the fiscal court for a library established under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite> is five cents on each $100 worth of property assessed for local taxation including net assessment growth. OAG 69-394.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where libraries were established under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite>, prior to the 1965 roll-back legislation, the city or county which established such libraries must reduce its respective library tax to the applicable compensating tax rate, or restricted budget, regardless of whether that rate or revenue would be less than five cents on $100. OAG 69-590.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county fiscal court is mandatorily required to levy a tax of not less than five cents on each $100 worth of property assessed for taxation by the county, for the county library. OAG 70-327.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a library district has been established under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite>, the fiscal court is required to appropriate money annually to furnish such library service, and the amount shall be not less than five cents nor more than 15 cents on each $100 worth of property assessed for local taxation, subject to the limitations of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.245" target="_blank">68.245</a></cite>. OAG 70-706.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a library is established, the legislative body may appropriate moneys from the general tax revenues or the question of a tax rate may be submitted to the voters as a special levy in addition to the existing property tax; thus, where it appeared that a city had made an appropriation, the appropriation had to come from the general tax revenues of the city. OAG 84-27.

        The roll-back provisions of KRS Ch. 132 apply to tax levies to maintain public libraries. Under KRS Ch. 132, a taxing district’s revenue from ad valorem taxes is limited; this chapter has the effect of rolling back the tax rate to maintain a constant revenue. Taxes levied to support a library created under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite> or this section would have to comply with KRS Ch. 132; however, where the library is not maintained by a tax levy, but by appropriation of funds from the local government, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.310" target="_self">173.310</a></cite> does not mandate a levy to maintain libraries created thereunder.

       It is the duty of the county clerk to list the county library tax on the tax rolls and, since computation of the library tax is part of the tax referred to in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132s132.550" target="_blank">132.550</a></cite>, he is not entitled to extra compensation for performance of the task.

       A library district created by the petition method can only be dissolved by the petition method, and a library district created by a vote of the people can only be dissolved by a vote of the people. OAG 67-263.

      <p>
       The increase or decrease in the tax rate must follow the identical method employed in the creation of such library district. OAG 67-263.

       Library districts organized under this section are not exempt from the payment of the sales tax provided in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc139" target="_blank">Chapter 139</a></cite> or the utility gross receipts license tax provided in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc160" target="_blank">Chapter 160</a></cite>.

       If, when submitting the question of the establishment of a library district and the imposition of a library tax to the voters, the question is stated on the ballot in substantially the form prescribed by subsection (2) of this section and the exact amount of the tax in cents is stated as required therein, it is permissible to express the tax also as a percentage. OAG 68-331.

OAG 68-606.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county library board can obtain the levy of a tax by the county fiscal court over and beyond the county’s general tax levy by either establishing a library district and thus a separate taxing district organized under this section or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.720" target="_self">173.720</a></cite> or it may request the county fiscal court, pursuant to the power of the fiscal courts under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.083" target="_blank">67.083</a></cite>, to present to the voters of the county the question of an additional tax levy which, if assented to by two-thirds of those voting upon the question, would be an intended, authorized “voting levy” and therefore not subject to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.245ol11" target="_blank">68.245(1)</a></cite> nor prohibited by Const., § 157. OAG 73-291.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there is no express statement in this section that the precise tax rate desired be indicated in the petition, a reading of this section in connection with KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.720" target="_self">173.720</a></cite>, which expressly requires the proposed rate be included in petitions under that section, implies that the rate be indicated in petitions under this section as well. OAG 79-102.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislative intent was for the precise ad valorem tax rate for support of the library district to be established by the petitioners under the petition method and by the voters under the ballot method and the fiscal court was not required or permitted to set such tax rate. OAG 79-102.

      Upon the creation of a district, the fiscal court of each county in the district shall at once notify the Department for Libraries and Archives of the establishment of the district and shall forward to the department a copy of the petition required pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.470" target="_self">173.470</a></cite>. The Department for Libraries and Archives shall then recommend to the county judge/executive of each county in the district the names of suitable persons from among the signers of the petition to be appointed to the board. The Department for Libraries and Archives in recommending persons to the county judge/executive for appointment to the board shall recommend twice as many persons for each county as the county is entitled to have members appointed, and the county judge/executive shall immediately, with the approval of the fiscal court, make the selection from those recommended. Where the district consists of one (1) county, the county judge/executive shall appoint five (5) persons from that county as members. The Department for Libraries and Archives shall prescribe by regulation the number of board members when the district consists of more than one (1) county, provided that the board shall consist of not less than one (1) nor more than four (4) members from each county, each county having such number of members as the proportion of its population bears to the total population in the district, and that the total membership of the board consists of not less than five (5) members. Where a county joins an already established district, the Department for Libraries and Archives shall, from among the signers of the petition, recommend to the county judge/executive of each county included in the new district for the first time twice as many persons for appointment to the board as the county is entitled to have appointed, and the county judge/executive shall select the members for the county from this list. The terms of the members of the counties composing the previously existing district shall expire immediately upon the organization of the new board and such vacancies shall be filled as provided in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.490" target="_self">173.490</a></cite>.

       Where all the territory in a county, including a town containing a library, was included in a library district the district could make an agreement with the existing library to pay it an annual fee for two years to expand the existing library. OAG 69-329.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment of a second library district within a county while another library district exists within the same county is contrary to the provisions of this section, since this section speaks in terms of authorization to organize all of the territory in a county into a library district and makes no provisions for there being more than one library district in the same county. OAG 81-257.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless a public library district plans to establish its own library, a public library district can only levy a tax to pay for contracting for library services from an existing library and, this being the case, there must be a contract for services before payment for services can be made; a public library district appears to be prohibited under either this section or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.460" target="_self">173.460</a></cite> from making payment to an existing library for services without first having a contract.

        Where the appellants circulated a petition to establish a library district prior to the 1979 general election and filed it after the election, and the petition contained the signatures of more than 51 percent of the number of qualified voters who voted in the 1978 general election, but only about 30 percent of the number of voters who voted in the 1979 general election, the petition was invalid under this section since the phrase “last general election” in subsection (1) of this section refers to the election prior to the filing of the petition rather than the election prior to the commencement of the petition, and the appellants, if they desired to have the 1978 general election control, could have started circulating the petition early enough to be filed before the 1979 general election. Dewey v. Wagers, 617 S.W.2d 55, 1981 Ky. App. LEXIS 245 (Ky. Ct. App. 1981) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Where the county library trustees filed a petition with the county fiscal court petitioning for a public library and a tax levy to support it, and the fiscal court declined to act on the petition, a mandamus was proper, for once a petition is filed with the fiscal court it cannot arbitrarily be ignored or denied and if technical deficiencies are found in the petition then there rests upon the court an obligation to inform those who filed it of such deficiencies.

        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A fiscal court’s adoption of an order establishing a library district as the result of petition is a nondiscretionary action which effectuates a statutory procedure, and a fiscal court has no power to rescind its order. Meredith v. Sears, 427 S.W.2d 813, 1968 Ky. LEXIS 694 (Ky. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the fiscal court adopted an order establishing a library district and subsequently found that the petition on which the action was instituted did not have sufficient valid signatures, the fiscal court had no authority to rescind its order establishing the district. Meredith v. Sears, 427 S.W.2d 813, 1968 Ky. LEXIS 694 (Ky. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The act of a fiscal court in approving a petition seeking the establishment of a library district is administrative or ministerial, or “political,” and not judicial, so the ordinary rules giving a court control over its judgments for a specified period are not applicable. Meredith v. Sears, 427 S.W.2d 813, 1968 Ky. LEXIS 694 (Ky. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the fiscal court had no authority to rescind its order establishing a library district and there was no appeal taken from that order, the sufficiency of the petition on which the order was adopted was not entitled to be questioned in an action to require the fiscal court to comply with its order. Meredith v. Sears, 427 S.W.2d 813, 1968 Ky. LEXIS 694 (Ky. 1968).

       <p>
        Tax imposed under this section on behalf of library district is imposed by the fiscal court as an agent of the district and it does not constitute a county tax. Consequently the fact that the amount of the tax when added to that of the county tax exceeds the maximum for counties does not make it violative of the Constitution. Boggs v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The petition must be signed by the number of people who would equal 51 percent of the people voting in the last general election in the district. OAG 67-229.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not the signers of the petition voted in the last general election is immaterial. OAG 67-229.
      </p>
      <p>
       The signers of the petition must be qualified and registered voters in the district at the time of signing. OAG 67-230.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “property” in the statute embraces both real and personal property having a situs in the library district and which is required to be assessed for local taxation and which is not exempted from taxation by a library district by statute or by the Constitution. OAG 67-230.
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.790" target="_self">173.790</a></cite> authorizing a decrease in the rate specified in the organizing petition could be effective in the year the library was organized only if the petitioned decrease coincided with or occurred prior to the regular county tax levying and collection program of events. OAG 67-234.
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition would be sufficiently “certified” if it contained a prefatory statement of the general nature and purpose of the petition and that it was being signed by duly qualified and registered voters of the particular county. OAG 67-234.
      </p>
      <p>
       If from the context of the petition the address of the petitioner can be fairly made out, and such that the signer reasonably may be located, it is sufficient. OAG 67-234.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the fiscal court decides it wants to accept or validate a defective petition, if it believes the petition is sufficient, it may do so by an appropriate order. OAG 67-234.
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioners must be qualified and registered voters at the precise time they sign the petition document. OAG 67-247.
      </p>
      <p>
       A library district created by the petition method can only be dissolved by the petition method, and a library district created by a vote of the people can only be dissolved by a vote of the people. OAG 67-263.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether the petition method or the vote method is utilized, if the fiscal court so determines that a petition, filed under either method, is valid, it is mandatory that the fiscal court take the required action in either case. OAG 67-263.
      </p>
      <p>
       The increase or decrease in the tax rate must follow the identical method employed in the creation of such library district. OAG 67-263.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where petitions are filed under both this section and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.470" target="_self">173.470</a></cite>, the first valid petition in time must control. OAG 67-263.
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining when the library tax is to be added to the tax bill by the clerk of the county court the key phrase is “the next annual tax bills.” A reasonable interpretation of this phrase is that the tax should be added to the nearest annual tax bill that will accommodate the regular tax collection schedule. This really says that it will be added to the tax bill as soon as practicable. OAG 67-383.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the library tax is to be added to the nearest tax bills of the county that will accommodate the regular tax collection schedule, the county clerk cannot add the library tax to the tax bills until the fiscal court orders the library tax levy. OAG 67-485.
      </p>
      <p>
       Library districts organized under this section are not exempt from the payment of the sales tax provided in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc139" target="_blank">Chapter 139</a></cite> or the utility gross receipts license tax provided in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc160" target="_blank">Chapter 160</a></cite>.

       A library district tax would be applicable to franchise assessments with a taxable situs within the library district. OAG 68-545.
      </p>
      <p>
       A district is created upon the filing of a valid petition and the fiscal court is mandatorily required to adopt a resolution ordering the tax levy. OAG 68-588.
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of the petition and the adoption of the resolution should be contemporaneous with an allowance of time for the fiscal court to determine the validity of the petition. OAG 68-588.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court has no authority to change the tax rate set up in the petition. OAG 68-588.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is mandatory and upon the submission of a petition complying with the requirements of this section, the fiscal court is required to order the tax levy. OAG 69-286.
      </p>
      <p>
       A library district organized pursuant to this section may contract with the fiscal court of an adjoining county to provide bookmobile service to that county provided it is done at no expense to the board or taxpayers of the county providing the service. OAG 70-296.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a petition is deemed by a fiscal court to be validly filed, the fiscal court is required to levy the specific library tax spelled out in the petition. OAG 70-578.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a petition is filed, it is the responsibility of the fiscal court to determine if it was validly filed under this section and to determine the validity of the signatures if they are questioned. OAG 70-578.
      </p>
      <p>
       The petition method of establishing a county library district is legal. OAG 70-578.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a petition by the required voters to dissolve a library district was filed, the dissolution of the library district would be effected upon the entry of a proper resolution of dissolution of the fiscal court. OAG 71-80.
      </p>
      <p>
       The signers of the petition need only be qualified voters within the territorial limits of the proposed district and need not be property owners. OAG 71-210.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although for libraries formed by the petition method the reports required under both KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.770ol12" target="_self">173.770(2)</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.38.html#tXXXVIIIc424s424.220" target="_blank">424.220</a></cite> are necessary, the library board, in making its report under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.770ol12" target="_self">173.770(2)</a></cite>, need only show the totals of amounts paid to each individual as salary and public utility bills with any other expenditures shown by individual voucher. OAG 71-438.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county library board can obtain the levy of a tax by the county fiscal court over and beyond the county’s general tax levy by either establishing a library district and thus a separate taxing district organized under this section or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.470" target="_self">173.470</a></cite> or it may request the county fiscal court, pursuant to the power of the fiscal courts under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.083" target="_blank">67.083</a></cite>, to present to the voters of the county the question of an additional tax levy which, if assented to by two-thirds of those voting upon the question, would be an intended, authorized “voting levy” and therefore not subject to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.245ol11" target="_blank">68.245(1)</a></cite> nor prohibited by Const., § 157. OAG 73-291.
      </p>
      <p>
       All taxes levied by a county in one year constitute one fund and are to be taken in the aggregate in computing the commission due the collecting officer except that where a special district is a separate taxing district and where commission procedure is not otherwise provided apart from KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc134s134.290ol12" target="_blank">134.290(2)</a></cite>, the county should be reimbursed for that portion of the sheriff’s commission allocated to the collection of such separate taxing district taxes and paid by the county as the library tax and the public health taxing district, under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc212s212.720" target="_blank">212.720</a></cite>, are not a part of the county tax within the prohibition of Const., § 157. OAG 73-647.
      </p>
      <p>
       A petitioner’s signature should be counted if the court in reviewing the signatures can reasonably determine that petitioner is a registered voter as shown on the registration records. OAG 74-357.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supplemental petitions can be filed until the 90-day expiration date. OAG 74-357.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “in the last general election” as formerly contained in subsection (1) of this section refers to the last general election preceding the time the 90 day petition signing period begins to run, which would be the time the first signature appears on the petition. OAG 76-608.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislative intent was for the precise ad valorem tax rate for support of the library district to be established by the petitioners under the petition method and by the voters under the ballot method and the fiscal court was not required or permitted to set such tax rate. OAG 79-102.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person who has signed a petition for a library district, before it is properly filed with the clerk, may revoke or obliterate his own signature by marking lines through the signature, stating that it is withdrawn and initialing the expungement, giving the fiscal court a documented basis for determining any such prefiling withdrawals. OAG 79-265.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a library district petition is filed, the fiscal court is responsible for determining whether or not the petition is valid and properly filed on its face including the checking of the names on the petition against the voters’ registration data in the county clerk’s office. OAG 79-265.
      </p>
      <p>
       The method of creation of a library district governs the method of dissolution and tax rate change; such methods must be the same. OAG 80-570.
      </p>
      <p>
       The members of the fiscal court would not be liable for the nonexpenditure of library funds collected and turned over to the library board under subsection (4) (now (2)) of this section, because the library board and its treasurer, and not the members of the fiscal court, are responsible for the expenditure of funds in accordance with KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.745" target="_self">173.745</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.755" target="_self">173.755</a></cite>. OAG 81-257.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (1) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.790" target="_self">173.790</a></cite> a library tax rate established by the petition method may be decreased, suspended or amended only by the petition method. OAG 81-257.
      </p>
      <p>
       The library tax imposed under this section is not a part of the county tax within the prohibition of Const., § 157; to the contrary, the library tax is a tax levied by a new authorized and separate taxing district pursuant to statutory authority. OAG 83-310.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “shall,” in the first sentence of subsection (1) of this section, is mandatory and where the petition is properly drawn and filed in every particular under this section, the fiscal court members, at a proper meeting by majority vote, are required to vote on and pass the resolution of a tax levy; any member failing to vote yes on such resolution would be in violation of this section. OAG 83-310.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the members of fiscal court fail or refuse to enter an order ordering the levy of a library tax pursuant to the filing of a petition, such inaction is in violation of this section and is arbitrary; Const., § 2 would also be violated, since it expressly prohibits the exercise of arbitrary power. If the fiscal court does not enter the order, as required, it may be subjected to a citizens’ suit in the local circuit court for mandamus or mandatory injunction to compel the fiscal court to do its duty. OAG 83-310.

       Where all the territory in a county, including a town containing a library, was included in a library district the district could make an agreement with the existing library to pay it an annual fee for two years to expand the existing library. OAG 69-329.

       The entire principal indebtedness would govern and not the amount of principal to be paid each year in measuring an obligation of the library district against the requirements of Ky. Const., § 157. OAG 71-34.

       Where a proposed library building would exceed the debt limitations of the library district, a holding company could be used to borrow the necessary funds and lease the library building to the library district. OAG 71-34.

       A library district can qualify to issue revenue bonds under KRS Ch. 58, since it is a special taxing district under Ky. Const., § 157 and is a “governmental agency” under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.07.html#tVIIc58s58.010ol13" target="_blank">58.010(3)</a></cite>; if it issues revenue bonds for a proposed project, the library district board can exercise the power to condemn real estate pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.07.html#tVIIc58s58.140" target="_blank">58.140</a></cite>. However, a library district which planned to use mortgage financing for library improvements had no power to condemn the real estate needed. OAG 82-343.
      </p>
      <p>
       While KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXIVc173s173.520ol11" target="_self">173.520(1)</a></cite> and subsection (1) of this section provide that the library district board shall “do all things necessary to provide efficient library service,” that language does not standing alone grant the power of condemnation. OAG 82-343.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the literal provisions of subdivision (2)(b) of this section, the library board’s authority to borrow money for the district operation is clearly limited to the anticipation of the revenue to be derived form taxes levied by the district for the fiscal year in which the money is borrowed; thus, the board could not borrow money in March of 1984 as a loan against tax revenues to be received during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1984.

        Circuit courts erred in rendering summary judgments in favor of two library districts because, while the applicable statutes were facially in conflict, they were both applicable to library districts formed by petition and could be harmonized in their application, where, if revenue from ad valorem taxes was to be increased above four percent, the increase had to be approved by petition of the voters.

        Prospective-only application of Ky. Rev. Stat.

OAG 72-384.

       Where a petition to rescind an increase in the library tax levy was filed several months after fiscal court had delivered the tax levy to the county clerk and the actual collection of the tax had already begun at the time the petition for decrease was filed with the clerk, the petition to decrease the library tax would be invalid under subdivision (3)(c) of this section, in that less than three years had passed since the county clerk received the fiscal court’s tax levy order.

        The library board having received more than sufficient funds from 1967 taxes to meet its contractual obligations as of the date the petition to dissolve was filed, any further levy or collection of taxes for its benefit was unauthorized and illegal.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The fiscal court should not permit the withdrawal of names from library petitions after the petitions have been filed, and even though the petition may be filed on a date prior to the deadline for filing. OAG 66-276.
      </p>
      <p>
       A library district created by the petition method can only be dissolved by the petition method, and a library district created by a vote of the people can only be dissolved by a vote of the people. OAG 67-263.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “contractual obligations” as used in subsection (5) of this section was intended by the Legislature to refer to actual financial obligations arising out of contract. OAG 67-524.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a resolution of dissolution is entered pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the library district is dissolved subject to the payment of accrued obligations and can no longer carry on its usual function of furnishing library services, and books and a bookmobile owned by the Department of Libraries (now Department for Libraries and Archives) in the possession of the dissolved district should be immediately returned. OAG 69-247.
      </p>
      <p>
       A dissolution cannot be completed until all contractual obligations, existing prior to the time of the filing of such petition for dissolution have been satisfied. OAG 69-552.
      </p>
      <p>
       A dissolution of the library district, effected after the execution of the loan documents and transfer of money to a nonprofit corporation to build a library would not operate to prevent the liquidation of the total contractual obligation of the construction corporation. OAG 69-552.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a petition by the required voters to dissolve a library district was filed, the dissolution of the library district would be effected upon the entry of a proper resolution of dissolution of the fiscal court. OAG 71-80.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a valid petition to dissolve has been filed and a resolution of dissolution adopted, such dissolution cannot operate to prevent the library board from paying its just debts or contractual obligations, but after such obligations have been paid, the dissolution would be complete. OAG 71-80.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a petition for dissolution is filed prior to the time the tax bills containing the first library levy are sent out, the tax must still be imposed if the library district has outstanding contractual obligations. OAG 71-210.
      </p>
      <p>
       The method of creation of a library district governs the method of dissolution and tax rate change; such methods must be the same. OAG 80-570.
