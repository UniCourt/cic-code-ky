      (6/25/2013). In subsection (24) of this statute, the list of KRS sections has been corrected. During the 2013 Regular Session of the General Assembly, the amendments to the Model State Code of Military Justice appeared in House Bill 362 and House Bill 167. The section numbers in these bills changed several times when alternative versions of the bills were introduced, but some of the internal references in subsection (24) of this statute ( 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 32, sec. 6) were inadvertently not corrected to correspond to those changes. Under the authority of
    KRS 7.136(1), the Reviser of Statutes has corrected those references to match the list that appears in Article 1(a)(14) of the Model State Code of Military Justice.

       Subject matter jurisdiction is established if a nexus exists between an offense, either military or non-military, and the state military force. Courts-martial have primary jurisdiction of military offenses of this code. A proper civilian court has primary jurisdiction of a non-military offense when an act or omission violates both this code and local criminal law, foreign or domestic. In such a case, a court-martial may be initiated only after the civilian authority has declined to prosecute or dismissed the charge, provided jeopardy has not attached. Jurisdiction over attempted crimes, conspiracy crimes, solicitation, and accessory crimes must be determined by the underlying offense.

The assessment of damages made by the board is subject to the approval of the commanding officer, and in the amount approved by that officer shall be charged against the pay of the offenders.

The injury in the case was real and irreparable because the son was being relocated during the school year to a distant state, and the father was unable to appear and oppose the mother's motion while serving his country.

      The General Assembly realizes the Commonwealth is subject at all times to disaster or emergency occurrences which can range from crises affecting limited areas to widespread catastrophic events, and that response to these occurrences is a fundamental responsibility of elected government in the Commonwealth. It is the intent of the General Assembly to establish and to support a statewide comprehensive emergency management program for the Commonwealth, and through it an integrated emergency management system, in order to provide for adequate assessment and mitigation of, preparation for, response to, and recovery from, the threats to public safety and the harmful effects or destruction resulting from all major hazards, including but not limited to: flood, flash flood, tornado, blizzard, ice storm, snow storm, wind storm, hail storm, or other severe storms; drought, extremes of temperature, earthquake, landslides, or other natural hazards; fire, forest fire, or other conflagration; enemy attack, threats to public safety and health involving nuclear, chemical, or biological agents or weapons; sabotage, riot, civil disorder or acts of terrorism, and other domestic or national security emergencies; explosion, power failure or energy shortages, major utility system failure, dam failure, building collapse, other infrastructure failures; transportation-related emergencies on, over, or through the highways, railways, air, land, and waters in the Commonwealth; emergencies caused by spill or release of hazardous materials or substances; mass-casualty or mass-fatality emergencies; other technological, biological, etiological, radiological, environmental, industrial, or agricultural hazards; or other disaster or emergency occurrences; or catastrophe; or other causes; and the potential, threatened, or impending occurrence of any of these events; and in order to protect life and property of the people of the Commonwealth, and to protect public peace, health, safety, and welfare, and the environment; and in order to ensure the continuity and effectiveness of government in time of emergency, disaster, or catastrophe in the Commonwealth, it is hereby declared to be necessary:

     Rationale and purpose of program — Division of Emergency Management.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly recognizes that the rationale and purpose of the comprehensive emergency management program of the Commonwealth has evolved from a program for response to threats to national security, enemy attack, and other national defense needs, to a program for response to all hazards, but primarily, domestic hazards and threats including natural, man-made, technological, industrial, or environmental emergencies or disasters, for which civil government is primarily responsible. Because of major changes in the rationale and necessity for emergency management capabilities, as well as the urgent requirement for multiagency participation and inter-agency coordination to ensure timely, effective, and appropriate disaster and emergency response in the Commonwealth, and to otherwise modernize and improve the administration, effectiveness, and relevance of the comprehensive emergency management program for the contemporary needs of the citizens of the Commonwealth, the General Assembly declares:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t0Vc39As39A.030ol11">
       A Division of Emergency Management is hereby created as the emergency management agency of state government which shall develop the comprehensive emergency management program of the Commonwealth on behalf of the Governor, and in consultation with the cabinet secretaries of state government, other appropriate state agency heads, local elected chief executives, local emergency management directors, and local emergency planning committees, for the purpose of developing and enhancing comprehensive emergency management program policies, plans, or procedures to provide for a coordinated responsive, and integrated emergency management system in the Commonwealth;

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this compact, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency disaster that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states’ National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.

        Article II. General Implementation.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Each party state entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       On behalf of the Governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.

     <p>
      (7/15/98). Although the introductory clause for 1998 Ky. Acts ch. 226, sec. 51 indicated that this statute was to be placed in KRS Chapter 39D, it is clear from context that KRS chapter 39C was intended because KRS Chapter 39D had its own penalty provision at 1998 Ky. Acts ch. 226, sec. 57. Therefore, to correct this manifest clerical or typographical error, KRS 7.136(1)(h), this statute has been codified in KRS Chapter 39C.

     <p>
      The General Assembly shall by law provide for the issuance and sale of bonds of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the limitation of indebtedness in Section 49 or any other section of the Constitution of Kentucky, which shall be in addition to all other bonds of the Commonwealth heretofore authorized. The proceeds of such additional bonds, or so many thereof as may be necessary for the purpose, shall be used and appropriated solely for the purpose of paying a cash bonus not to exceed $500 for service outside the continental limits of the United States, and $300 for service in the continental limits of the United States to the veterans, their widows or heirs, or next of kin, of the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, and the Korean conflict, who were residents of the Commonwealth at the time of their entry into the service and at least six (6) months prior thereto. The General Assembly at the same session authorizing the issuance of the bonds shall levy a tax upon all retail sales at such a rate as will pay the interest upon and retire the bonds in no less than thirty (30) years, provided that retail sales of food and food products, medicines, and clothing may be exempted from such tax.

        Veterans’ bonus legislation does not violate the federal Constitution or the Kentucky Constitution since the status of the veteran is not that of a soldier in the United States army but that of a Kentucky citizen whom the legislature and the people deem proper to recognize because of his past service, and the bonus is reimbursement to such Kentuckians for losses suffered by reason of military service and has nothing whatever to do with raising or supporting armies.

        The payment of money to those in a certain class for a recognizable public purpose does not violate either Const., §§ 3 or 171 and the designation of veterans as distinguished from those who did not serve is a reasonable classification. Stovall v. Gartrell, 332 S.W.2d 256, 1960

        Provision of Acts 1958, ch. 48 to the effect that it provided for the retirement of the bonds in “not more than thirty years” violated Const., § 50 wherein it is provided that bonds shall be retired “within 30 years”; however, since it was not materially substantial on the question of exceeding the debt limitation, this invalid provision could not be held to nullify the enactment or the vote of the people.

        The votes of veteran members of the legislature on a veterans’ bonus were not void since the legislation presented involved a broad classification of a substantial segment of the public and although veterans in the legislature might anticipate that someday they would benefit from the legislation, such benefits were not private or personal, but were benefits to be received as members of a class.

        It was the intention of the legislature that all beneficiaries entitled to a bonus should receive their share thereof, but that where the veterans’ division makes a determination as to the validity of a claim, though later found to be erroneous, and makes a conscientious though unsuccessful effort to recover an erroneous overpayment of a bonus, no additional funds can be paid out to other qualified beneficiaries.

        Plaintiff’s claim that Kentucky bonus law was repugnant to Constitution of Kentucky and Constitution of United States on ground that congress under exclusive power to enact laws relating to veterans’ benefits had pre-empted the field and that at some future date he might be required to pay a tax to sustain the purposes of the statute did not present a justiciable controversy within the meaning of the declaratory judgment law as plaintiff did not show that he would suffer some direct injury or that there was a threat that he might suffer such injury. Grise v. Combs, 183 F. Supp. 705, 1960 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5142 (E.D.

       <p>
        Law authorizing payment of a veteran’s bonus was constitutional since the military is a public service for which a grant of separate emoluments may be made under Const., § 3 and since the granting of the bonus to person who had been a resident of the state for six months before he entered the armed forces and was a resident of the state on the date the electorate approved the bonus proposal formed a proper integral classification.

        The General Assembly did not act unreasonably in generally classifying or confining “qualified veterans” to receive bonus payments to those who were residents of the Commonwealth for at least six months before entering the armed services and who were residents on November 3, 1959, the date the electorate approved the bonus proposal.

        In determining the veterans’ bonus to be paid, the difference in monthly allotments payable for service within the country and service without the country and the difference between $300 and $500 maximum amounts payable in the two categories are obviously fair and reasonable and do not invalidate the statute.

        If a veteran files an application by December 31, 1961, and qualifies for payment and dies before the bonus payment is made, the claim is not thereby extinguished and the bonus does not lapse and the pending application should be revived in the name of the first surviving beneficiary upon the filing, within a reasonable time, of an amended application by the beneficiary or by compliance with any other reasonable procedure which the division may require.

        It was the intention of the legislature that all beneficiaries entitled to a bonus should receive their share thereof, but that where the veterans’ division makes a determination as to the validity of a claim, though later found to be erroneous, and makes a conscientious though unsuccessful effort to recover an erroneous overpayment of a bonus, no additional funds can be paid out to other qualified beneficiaries.

        It was the intention of the legislature that all beneficiaries entitled to a bonus should receive their share thereof, but where the veterans’ division makes a determination as to the validity of a claim, though later found to be erroneous, and makes a conscientious though unsuccessful effort to recover an erroneous overpayment of a bonus, no additional funds can be paid out to other qualified beneficiaries.

       The Commonwealth of Kentucky recognizes the vast majority of honorable burials for Kentuckians who have served their state and nation in the Armed Forces are conducted by the veterans’ service organizations. The active military units in Kentucky, the Kentucky National Guard, and the military reserves are providing burial honors details as available manpower permits. Year 2000 data from the Department of Defense shows over 497,000 veterans died, but only 91,074 military funeral honors were performed. Although the veterans’ service organizations provide untold thousands of unofficial services, many Kentucky veterans are still being buried without honors, including firing details, color guard, and pallbearers.
