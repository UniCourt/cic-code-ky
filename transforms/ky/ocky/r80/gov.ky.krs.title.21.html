        The power to appoint members of boards and agencies within the executive department of government is an essentially executive power which cannot be exercised by any member of the legislative department; accordingly, the provisions in this section by which the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tem of the Senate are authorized to make appointments to the State Fair Board are an invalid unconstitutional incursion by the General Assembly, or in this case, its designees, into the separation of powers doctrine.

        The 1946 act amending the statutes relating to the state fair became effective as an act at the time prescribed by Ky. Const., § 55, regardless of fact that new state fair board provided for by act would not be completely organized until three and one-half years later; therefore, the provision of the 1946 act creating the position of manager of the state fair became effective when the act took effect, and was not postponed until time of organization of new board.

        The 1946 act amending the statutes relating to the state fair became effective as an act at the time prescribed by Ky. Const., § 55, regardless of fact that new state fair board provided for by act would not be completely organized until three and one-half years later; therefore, the provision of the 1946 act creating the position of manager of the state fair became effective when the act took effect, and was not postponed until time of organization of new board.

        The duty of the fiscal court to make appropriations for the farm bureau is subject to constitutional restrictions upon the creation of county debts and obligations for the legislature cannot impose upon the county a duty that in itself or under specific conditions would contravene the provisions of the Constitution.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that activities involving the use and exhibition of farm animals are engaged in by a large number of citizens of Kentucky and that these activities also attract to Kentucky a large number of nonresidents, significantly contributing to the economy of Kentucky. Since it is recognized that there are inherent risks in working with, exhibiting, and using farm animals which should be understood by participants in farm animal activities and which are essentially impossible for owners of farm animals or sponsors of farm animal activities to eliminate, it is the purpose of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc247s247.401" target="_self">247.401</a></cite> to 247.4029 to define the areas of responsibility and affirmative acts for which activity sponsors, professionals, and participants shall be responsible, to specify risks of injury for which activity sponsors, professionals, and participants shall not be responsible, and to specify areas of responsibilities of farm animal participants. Therefore, the General Assembly determines that to preserve and promote the long Kentucky tradition of activities involving farm animals and the health and safety of the citizens of Kentucky and visitors to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc247s247.401" target="_self">247.401</a></cite> to 247.4029 are necessary to instruct persons voluntarily engaging in farm animal activities of the potential risks inherent in the activities.

KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc247s247.401" target="_self">247.401</a></cite> to 247.4029 also establish the policy of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that persons do not have a duty to eliminate risks inherent in farm animal activities which are beyond their immediate control if those risks are or should be reasonably obvious, expected, or necessary to participants engaged in farm animal activities. Furthermore, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc247s247.401" target="_self">247.401</a></cite> to 247.4029 establish the policy that the sponsor, instructor, or other professional engaged in farm animal activities who breaches a duty to a farm animal activity participant and causes foreseeable injury to the participant shall be responsible for the injury in accordance with other applicable law.

        It was inappropriate for the appellate court to contradict Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 247.4015 and suggest liability for allegedly raising or waving one’s arms, as the statute includes “sudden movements” within the definition of “inherent risks of farm animal activities” assumed by farm animal activity participants like plaintiff. Consequently, no genuine issue of material fact existed as to defendants’ liability under the statute. Daugherty v. Tabor, 554 S.W.3d 319, 2018<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Associate members of a tobacco board of trade organized as a corporation could not properly serve as directors of the corporation or serve on those committees which perform functions normally performed by warehouse members or vote for directors, since all of those activities would constitute participating in management.

        Even though associate members on the board abstained from voting on warehouse-member functions, their presence at board meetings when these matters were discussed would constitute forbidden participation in the management and activities of the board.

       The Home Tobacco Warehouse Company, which owns four separate warehouses, clearly would be required under the terms of this section to pay a separate license fee of $250 for each warehouse building regardless of the fact that the company owns all four (4) buildings, and regardless of the fact that there may only be one general office, provided, of course, that tobacco is sold at each separate warehouse, but if some tobacco warehouse buildings are used solely for storing tobacco no license would be required for such buildings.<cite class="OAG">OAG 78-438</cite>.

      </h4>
      <p>
       In view of the fact that tobacco warehouses are public warehouses and in view of legislation which grants the department of agriculture power to license, supervise and regulate such warehouses, agents of the department are authorized to examine the records of tobacco warehouses.<cite class="OAG">OAG 76-175</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A warehouseman can offer such a service as lending money to tobacco growers only when such a service is extended to all those growers using his warehouse, and failure to do so violates this section.<cite class="OAG">OAG 78-536</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would appear to be a violation of the anti-discrimination provisions of subsection (1) of this section for a tobacco warehouse to charge a lower commission to tobacco farmers who elect to sell their tobacco by the bale method than it charges to tobacco farmers who elect to sell their tobacco by the tied method since the general assembly has eliminated flexibility and precluded the utilization of reasonable classifications in connection with the sale of tobacco by tobacco warehouses.<cite class="OAG">OAG 81-401</cite>.

Any funds designated to the Commonwealth from the settlement agreement or related federal legislation and all investment income accruing to the fund shall not be expended until appropriated by the General Assembly. The General Assembly’s highest priority for distributing any funds from this account shall be for tobacco farmers and tobacco-impacted communities and health-related areas. Moneys in the fund, including all investment income accruing to the fund, shall be distributed within twenty (20) days of April 26, 2000, and within twenty (20) days of receipt of any moneys deposited to the fund after April 26, 2000, as follows:

     <p>
      There is established in the State Treasury a fund to be known as the “Rural Development Fund.” This fund shall exist for the purpose of receipt and expenditure of moneys to improve and promote agricultural development for residents of the Commonwealth. The fund may receive state appropriations, gifts, grants, and federal funds and shall be disbursed by the State Treasurer upon the warrant of the chair of the rural development board. Before and after July 1, 2000, fifty percent (50%) of the proceeds in the tobacco settlement agreement fund shall be deposited in this fund as provided under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc248s248.654" target="_self">248.654</a></cite>. All investment income earned from moneys deposited in the fund shall accrue to the fund. The moneys in the fund shall not lapse at the close of any fiscal year but shall be carried forward in the next fiscal year for the purpose of the fund. The board shall develop and oversee the implementation of a strategic plan. The strategic plan shall identify both short-term and long-term goals and the appropriate oversights to measure progress toward achievement of those goals, and it shall be updated every two (2) years. The board shall submit an annual report to the Governor and the Legislative Research Commission by September 1 of each year for the preceding fiscal year, outlining its activities and expenditures. The Auditor of Public Accounts, on an annual basis, shall conduct a thorough review of all expenditures from the fund and, if necessary in the opinion of the Auditor, an audit of the operations of the fund. No money in the fund shall be allocated until the board has adopted a strategic plan.

Further, while manufacturing methamphetamine required that the defendant acted in the past, proving that the defendant possessed the anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine in the future required proving how the defendant was going to act; thus, the two crimes did not constitute a “continuing course of conduct” and did not violate double jeopardy.

        In a case involving a borrowed vehicle with a methamphetamine laboratory in the back seat, defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal because the evidence was sufficient to infer his knowledge of the methamphetamine laboratory, which had a strong odor.

       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction of possessing anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine because although the liquid anhydrous ammonia found in the freezer was not tested, the contents of the propane tank field-tested positive for anhydrous ammonia and a detective testified that the charge of possessing anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container was based on the anhydrous ammonia found in the propane tank, not the contents of the bowl found in the freezer. Furthermore, the fact that a manufacturing process was ongoing at the time of the search and that numerous other chemicals and items of equipment used in the manufacture of methamphetamine were found nearby, created a reasonable inference that defendant intended to use the anhydrous ammonia to manufacture methamphetamine.

        KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc250s250.991ol12" target="_self">250.991(2)</a></cite> refers to an enhanced penalty for a “subsequent offense” without defining it. In that circumstance, the Supreme Court of Kentucky has always interpreted such language to require a conviction-to-offense sequence, i.e., the second offense must occur after conviction of the first offense. The rationale behind this interpretation is that after punishment is imposed for the commission of a crime, the double penalty is held in terrorem over the criminal, for the purpose of effecting his reformation, and preventing further and subsequent offenses by him; the Supreme Court of Kentucky adopts this interpretation for subsequent offenses prosecuted under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc250s250.991ol12" target="_self">250.991(2)</a></cite>.

The board or the department shall provide for the collection of the assessment, under the provisions of this section, for the purpose of financing the Kentucky grain insurance fund, which is hereby created. Assessments shall be levied only on fund-covered grains.

       <p>
        In Chapter 12 case, brand placed on cattle by leasing party was not sufficient to establish ownership over party with security interest because brand was not registered and did not become part of state report until after bankruptcy petition was filed. In re Purdy, 2015 Bankr. LEXIS 2938 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. Sept. 2, 2015), aff'd, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107565 (W.D. Ky. Aug. 15, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankruptcy court properly concluded that a lessor did not own any of the cattle at the time of an auction because, all the cattle were delivered to the debtor, incorporated into his operation, were being fed, cared for, and producing milk before the lessor had signed a lease with the debtor, the leases at issue were found to be true leases, and the bankruptcy court did not violate the mandate rule by holding an evidentiary hearing to determine who owned the cattle that were auctioned, and, even if the lessor was correct as to the legal application of the branding statute, 289 out of 415 cattle bore two indicia of ownership at the time of the auction, which the bankruptcy court determined was inconclusive and “not probative” of ownership.

        A cattle guard, consisting of parallel pipes laid lengthwise over a ditch, is not a lawful fence. Burgin v.

        The test of a lawful fence is its height at the point where stock get over it, and it is immaterial in an action for damages from trespassing stock that the fence at another point was not of a lawful height, or that a gate was left open, if the fence was of lawful height at the place where the stock crossed it.

    suit under the Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act was vacated because, pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc256s256.042" target="_self">256.042</a></cite>, the district court has exclusive jurisdiction over all actions arising under the Act; thus, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the owners’

    claim under the Act was anchored in the district court, the neighbor’s counterclaim and the owners’
    common law claims, if any, should be addressed in the district court alongside the owners’

        Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act consists of two substantive statutes, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc256s256.030" target="_self">256.030</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc256s256.042" target="_self">256.042</a></cite>, and these statutes make clear that the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the act; however KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc24As24A.120ol11" target="_blank">24A.120(1)</a></cite>, which provides a general grant of jurisdiction to the circuit court in civil matters, specifically excludes from the purview of the district court matters affecting title to real estate. As such, a district court erred in not only determining the rights and obligations of the parties under the Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act but in also determining the location of the boundary line itself because such a determination is clearly beyond the bounds of the district court’s subject matter jurisdiction. Parsley v. McCauley, 338 S.W.3d 290, 2010<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 206</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2010).

       “One-half of the fence” means one-half (1/2) of each fence on either side of the right-of-way. One party cannot construct the entire fence on one side of the right-of-way and force the other party to construct the entire fence on the other side. Lexington &amp; E. R. Co. v. Russell, 177<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc79" target="_blank">Ky. 79</a></cite>, 197 S.W. 523, 1917<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 544</cite> (Ky. 1917).

       Railroad is bound to erect and maintain fence along one-half of division line, as required by this section, without written notice being given by landowner as provided in
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc256s256.120" target="_self">256.120</a></cite>. The purpose of written notice is to set criminal law in motion in order to find party in default.

      <p>
       Neither party can require the other to erect a division fence on its part of the line, or recover from the other the cost of erecting a fence, unless the petition alleges that written notice has been given and that the land is improved or inclosed or if unimproved that the land has been inclosed on three sides either by owner or natural barriers.

       Where a railroad company could reasonably anticipate that children would be upon its tracks, the railroad had a duty to prevent children from going upon the tracks and this duty could have been met either by stationing guardsmen at the place where children were entering the tracks, or by erecting a suitable fence; the law imposed such duty on the railroad, unless the cost of fulfilling that duty would have been unreasonable in relation to the risk involved. Kentucky &amp; I. T. R. Co. v. Mann, 312 S.W.2d 451, 1958<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 224</cite> (Ky. 1958).

       When a lawful fence has been constructed, the party constructing it is only required to exercise reasonable care to maintain it. Crawford v. Southern R. in Kentucky, 153<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 812</cite>, 156 S.W. 861, 1913<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 923</cite> (Ky. 1913); Hiens v.

       Because railroad owned nothing more than a right-of-way easement, upon abandonment of the easement, it could not be obligated to maintain fencing along the easement and its attempt to convey by quit-claim deed a certain stretch of the right of way to outside parties was ineffective; present owners of the servient estates hold the underlying strips of land discharged with the easement; owners generally holding to the center of the strip of land comprising the easement to be determined on remand.

         1. Cattle Guards.
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        “Cattle guard” means such an appliance as will prevent animals from escaping from inclosures and crossing railroad tracks into lands of others adjoining the right-of-way. Any neglect of railroad to keep cattle guards in proper condition for this purpose renders it liable for any injuries that may result therefrom, but cattle guards need not be so constructed that cattle can pass over them with safety as this would defeat purpose of their requirement. Louisville, H. &amp; S. L. R. Co. v. Beauchamp, 108<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc47" target="_blank">Ky. 47</a></cite>, 55 S.W. 716, 21<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        This section applies only to railroads, and does not by implication make a cattle guard a lawful fence within the meaning of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc256s256.010" target="_self">256.010</a></cite>.

        Cattle guards should be erected and maintained at all terminal points of fences parallel to railroad, not at terminal points of fences on one side only of the railroad, nor when the railroad enters or leaves a person’s inclosures or farm, unless this should be the terminal of the fencing on both or one side of the railroad. Parrish v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., 126<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 638</cite>, 104 S.W. 690, 31<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1020</cite>, 1907<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Railroad cannot be required to erect cattle guards except at points where construction of fencing may be required, nor until such fencing has been erected. Parrish v. Louisville &amp; N. R.

        A railroad is required to erect and maintain cattle guards at such places only as this section designates. Mansfield v. Frankfort &amp; C. R.

        Neglect of railroad to erect cattle guards at public crossings and keep them in repair renders it liable for injuries to cattle escaping from a highway upon its track. McGhee v. Guyn, 98<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc209" target="_blank">Ky. 209</a></cite>, 32 S.W. 615, 17<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

       </p>
       <p>
        Railroad cannot excuse itself, for failure to erect cattle guards at private passway, as against one other than the owner of the passway upon the ground that owner of the passway has not required the erection of guards or has not offered to contribute to their erection. Mansfield v. Frankfort &amp; C. R. Co., 193<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc95" target="_blank">Ky. 95</a></cite>, 234 S.W. 956, 1921<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Fact that type of cattle guard is in general use by railroads is not conclusive that such cattle guard is sufficient; cattle guard need not afford absolute protection against trespassing stock but must be reasonably sufficient to prevent cattle from crossing it.

        Owner of a private passway, over a railroad, cannot require railroad to erect and maintain cattle guards on each side of the passway unless he offers to pay one-half (1/2) cost of erection and maintenance.

        Owner cannot acquire prescriptive right to require railroad to maintain cattle guards at its sole expense on sides of his passway across tracks, on ground that railroad has for long period of time constructed and maintained such cattle guards at its sole expense. Payton v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., 115<cite class="ky_code">Ky. 53</cite>, 72 S.W. 346, 24<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L. Rptr. 1896</cite>, 1903<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Neglect of railroad to maintain cattle guard where stock may stray on track will render it liable for damage to stock. McGhee v. Gaines, 98<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.15.html#tXVc182" target="_blank">Ky. 182</a></cite>, 32 S.W. 602, 17<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

       </p>
       <p>
        It was duty of railroad to maintain cattle guard so as to attract attention of livestock, and permitting it to be overgrown with weeds and grass so that it could not be seen by livestock was negligence. Louisville, H. &amp; S. L. R. Co. v. Beauchamp, 108<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc47" target="_blank">Ky. 47</a></cite>, 55 S.W. 716, 21<cite class="ky_rptr_code">Ky. L.

        Railroad has as much duty to maintain cattle guards as it has to erect them. Nashville C. &amp; S. L. R. Co. v.

       (7/15/2010). A reference to the “Kentucky Horse Racing Authority” in subsection (9) of this section, as created by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 106, sec. 1, has been changed in codification to the “Kentucky Horse Racing Commission” to reflect the reorganization of certain parts of the Executive Branch, as set forth in Executive Order 2009-535 and confirmed by the General Assembly in 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 24. This change was made by the Reviser of Statutes pursuant to 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 24, sec. 1938.

      <p>
       (7/15/2010). The proposed Senate Committee Substitute to House Bill 398, which became 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 106, attached the text of Senate Bill 105/HCS to HB 398 and made several changes to the existing provisions, including the addition of paragraph (c) to subsection (9) of this statute. As drafted, paragraph (c) contained the phrase, “commission authorized under this Act.” After examination of the materials in the bill folder and consultation with the drafter, “this Act” was changed to “this chapter” during codification, as all sections of 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 106 are located in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc257" target="_self">Chapter 257</a></cite>. This substitution was made by the Reviser of Statutes under the authority of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136ol11f" target="_blank">7.136(1)(f)</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Where KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.095" target="_self">258.095</a></cite> in defining owner as any person who accepts custody of a dog, operated to insulate the legal owner from liability against another owner of the dog, the trial court properly entered judgment against the dog groomer who accepted the owner’s dog which later bit the groomer’s face. Jordan v. Lusby, 81 S.W.3d 523, 2002<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 1399</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parent of one of the dog owners, who was waiting by request at the owners’
    residence for an animal control officer to arrive and take the dog, was a statutory owner under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.095ol15" target="_self">258.095(5)</a></cite> when the parent saw the officer in a truck parked two blocks away from the owners’
    house, walked up to the truck with the dog, and motioned for the officer to get out of the truck. However, the officer did not become an owner of the dog for then getting out of the truck. Fetchko v. Morgan, 2008<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 195</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. June 27, 2008), review denied, ordered not published, 2009<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 134</cite> (Ky. Feb. 11, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Landlords were the statutory owners under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.095ol15" target="_self">258.095(5)</a></cite> of a tenant’s dog for purposes of establishing liability under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.235ol14" target="_self">258.235(4)</a></cite> because the statute unambiguously stated that a person who permitted a dog to remain on the premises that he owned was deemed an owner for purposes of the dog-bite liability statute, and the landlords knew that the dog was on the leased premises, but did not take any affirmative steps to make sure the dog was removed from the property after revoking the tenant’s permission to keep it. Benningfield v. Zinsmeister, 367 S.W.3d 561, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 83</cite> (Ky. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where ownership of a dog is premised on permission for the dog to remain on property, there must be an element of tenancy, even for a short period of time, in order to establish liability; therefore, liability would not extent to temporary excursions onto another’s property, even when done so with the landowner’s permission, for example when a dog entered a public park in which dogs were allowed. Benningfield v. Zinsmeister, 367 S.W.3d 561, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 83</cite> (Ky. 2012).

        County ordinance that banned the possession of pit bull terriers was not invalid. It was supplemental to, rather than inconsistent with, KRS ch. 258, which banned vicious dogs generally, since it did not limit the statute’s application but instead provided a more comprehensive plan of protection. Bess v. Bracken County Fiscal Court, 210 S.W.3d 177, 2006<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 347</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).

       While the state imposes a license fee on dogs pursuant to this section, there is nothing under the state dog act prohibiting a city from also imposing a license fee and from regulating dogs. In fact, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.365" target="_self">258.365</a></cite> provides, in effect, that nothing under the act shall be construed to prohibit or limit the right of any city to pass or enforce any ordinance regulating dogs, the provisions of which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.<cite class="OAG">OAG 71-160</cite>.

       Under this section and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.195" target="_self">258.195</a></cite>, a county dog warden paid by the fiscal court a salary of $1,200 per year is entitled to retain the sum of 25¢ for each dog license issued and, in addition, if he operates the county dog pound at his own expense, he is entitled to reimbursement for his expenses actually so incurred in addition to his salary and the 25¢ fees he is entitled to retain.<cite class="OAG">OAG 73-557</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An operator of a pet store who sells dogs under a permit from a city must also comply with state requirements pertaining to the licensing of dogs by obtaining from the dog warden a license under this section for each dog six (6) months old or over owned or kept by him or he must obtain a kennel license from the dog warden pursuant to former KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.165" target="_self">258.165</a></cite> (now repealed) for the dogs required to be licensed under this section.<cite class="OAG">OAG 74-699</cite>.

      <p>
       The department of agriculture, with the approval of the Governor, could authorize members of 4-H clubs throughout the state to act as agents of the department for the purpose of selling dog licenses and receive for such services a 25¢ fee for each license sold.<cite class="OAG">OAG 77-578</cite>.

      <p>
       The fiscal court could appoint, as the county dog warden, a deputy sheriff who is presently serving in this capacity without there existing an incompatible situation.<cite class="OAG">OAG 66-398</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the fiscal court failed to designate the position of a deputy sheriff to serve as dog warden, if the sheriff has not appointed all the deputies that he is permitted by law, he can appoint the present dog warden as one of his deputies.<cite class="OAG">OAG 66-398</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A dog warden appointed by the fiscal court pursuant to this section is not a peace officer and consequently does not possess the powers of a peace officer.<cite class="OAG">OAG 68-18</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A dog warden may seize unlicensed dogs running at large but may not go on private premises to apprehend these dogs without a warrant.<cite class="OAG">OAG 68-93</cite>;<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-597</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kentucky law does not impose a general requirement upon either a local health department or a city for the payment of the expense of housing animals that have bitten people.<cite class="OAG">OAG 68-387</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city could contract with the county to supplement the county dog warden’s salary for the purpose of utilizing his services in helping enforce the provisions of an ordinance regulating dogs within the city.<cite class="OAG">OAG 70-492</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court can require the dog warden to pick up dogs that are unlicensed and running loose upon the public ways in the city as well as in the county, particularly under a contract with the city.<cite class="OAG">OAG 70-492</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.135" target="_self">258.135</a></cite>, a county dog warden paid by the fiscal court a salary of $1,200 per year is entitled to retain the sum of 25¢ for each dog license issued and, in addition, if he operates the county dog pound at his own expense, he is entitled to reimbursement for his expenses actually so incurred in addition to his salary and the 25¢ fees he is entitled to retain.<cite class="OAG">OAG 73-557</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section would not apply to a city dog warden, which is a position created solely by ordinance.<cite class="OAG">OAG 74-320</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A dog warden appointed by the fiscal court is not a peace officer, unless separately made so by, for example, being appointed a deputy sheriff, and has no power of arrest, unless made a peace officer, to enforce the provisions of the dog laws, although the fiscal court may require him to seize unlicensed dogs running at large as well as to perform other duties not inconsistent with the dog laws or in conflict with other statutory provisions.<cite class="OAG">OAG 75-383</cite>;<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-597</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “shall” as used in subsection (1) of this section is mandatory and thus the fiscal court is required to employ a dog warden and establish and maintain a dog pound.<cite class="OAG">OAG 78-756</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1) of this section provides in part that the fiscal court of each county shall employ a dog warden and that the fiscal court of each county shall establish and maintain a dog pound, and since the word “shall” is mandatory, the fiscal court is required to employ a dog warden and to establish and maintain a dog pound.<cite class="OAG">OAG 79-161</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are no express statutory provisions in this section requiring the county dog warden to pick up dogs anywhere in the county, the fiscal court pursuant to its regulatory powers may require the dog warden to pick up such dogs that are unlicensed and loose upon the public way and if the dog warden has been so instructed by the fiscal court, the service should be supplied to the entire county and not just to unincorporated areas, particularly where the city or cities in the county do not have a dog ordinance.<cite class="OAG">OAG 79-161</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the state department of agriculture does have certain responsibilities in connection with this chapter, the fiscal court, and not the department, is responsible for the appointment of a dog warden and the establishment and maintenance of a dog pound.<cite class="OAG">OAG 79-161</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city cannot, through a city ordinance, impose duties and responsibilities on the county dog warden since his basic duties are set forth in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258" target="_self">Chapter 258</a></cite> and any additional duties could only be imposed by the fiscal court.<cite class="OAG">OAG 80-330</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the county dog pound is located on the private premises of the county dog warden pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the dog warden, as a minor county officer, is required to make his facilities available to the public for the transaction of legitimate business activities at least five (5) days a week for seven to eight (8) hours per day, as required by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.160" target="_blank">61.160</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 81-251</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Counties may enact ordinances relative to dog control but whether they do or not, they must fulfill their statutory obligations as set forth in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258" target="_self">Chapter 258</a></cite>. While cities have the authority to enact dog control measures they cannot impose obligations upon a county which the county does not agree to and which are in excess of the county’s duties and obligations under the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258" target="_self">Chapter 258</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-447</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county has definite and prescribed obligations under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258" target="_self">Chapter 258</a></cite> but they do not include the duty to accept dogs at its pound picked up by municipal dog control authorities, particularly where violations of municipal ordinances are involved. While the cities and the county have the authority to enter into a joint or cooperative agreement concerning dog control and the use of the county dog pound, which could include a boarding fee for dogs delivered to the pound by city dog control officers, the cities, in the absence of an agreement with the county, cannot require the county to accept dogs picked up for violations of municipal ordinances; absent an agreement between the cities and the county relative to dog control, the cities will enforce their ordinances only, and the county and all peace officers will enforce the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258" target="_self">Chapter 258</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-447</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither this section nor any other section of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258" target="_self">Chapter 258</a></cite> makes a dog warden a peace officer and, therefore, he does not possess the powers of a peace officer; he could be made a peace officer by being appointed, for example, a deputy sheriff but such an appointment could not involve an increase in the number of deputy sheriff positions beyond the number established by the fiscal court pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.530" target="_blank">64.530</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-597</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a dog warden does not possess the power of a police officer unless he is made a peace officer by being appointed as such, a dog warden who has not acquired the status of a peace officer cannot utilize the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.40.html#tXXXXc431s431.015" target="_blank">431.015</a></cite> and has no legal authority to issue a citation.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-597</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are no express statutory provisions requiring the dog warden to pick up dogs anywhere in the county, the fiscal court pursuant to its regulatory powers under this section could require the dog warden to pick up such dogs as are unlicensed and loose upon the public way; however, a dog warden has no authority to enter upon private premises for the purpose of picking up an owner’s unlicensed dog without a warrant.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-597</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are no express statutory provisions requiring the dog warden to pick up dogs anywhere in the county, the fiscal court pursuant to its regulatory powers under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.195" target="_self">258.195</a></cite> may require the dog warden to pick up unlicensed or unidentified dogs found running at large.<cite class="OAG">OAG 83-209</cite>.

       A city ordinance providing that any dog without a proper license tag or other legible identification and which is found running at large may be seized by a peace officer is valid under this section, but such ordinance should also contain a provision, in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, requiring that unlicensed dogs that are picked up be impounded for seven days before they are destroyed.<cite class="OAG">OAG 73-105</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Destruction of a dog in a humane manner” would include shooting which would not constitute cruelty as long as death was instantaneous.<cite class="OAG">OAG 73-105</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although only those dogs six months of age or older are required to be licensed, any dog which does not bear either a proper license tag or other legible identification may be seized and impounded by a peace officer if it is found to be running at large.<cite class="OAG">OAG 76-149</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to the clause in this section about “sold in accordance with other provisions of this chapter,” there are no provisions in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258" target="_self">Chapter 258</a></cite> relative to the selling of dogs which have been held for the seven-day period and not claimed.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-595</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are no express statutory provisions requiring the dog warden to pick up dogs anywhere in the county, the fiscal court pursuant to its regulatory powers under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.195" target="_self">258.195</a></cite> may require the dog warden to pick up unlicensed or unidentified dogs found running at large.<cite class="OAG">OAG 83-209</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While an unlicensed dog loose and unattended on the public way is clearly running at large and subject to being picked up by a peace officer or a dog warden (when he has been so instructed by his employing governmental entity), the status of a dog which is loose and unattended on the private property of someone other than his owner is not clear.<cite class="OAG">OAG 83-209</cite>.

        County ordinance that banned the possession of pit bull terriers was not invalid. It was supplemental to, rather than inconsistent with, KRS ch. 258, which banned vicious dogs generally, since it did not limit the statute’s application but instead provided a more comprehensive plan of protection. Bess v. Bracken County Fiscal Court, 210 S.W.3d 177, 2006<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 347</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2006).

    dog while she was being watched by the homeowners in the pursuit of a day care business. The child was too young to be contributorily negligent, and no third party could be implicated for liability. May v. Holzknecht, 320 S.W.3d 123, 2010<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

Carmical v. Bullock, 251 S.W.3d 324, 2007<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 257</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).

        Landlords were the statutory owners under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.235ol14" target="_self">258.235(4)</a></cite> of a tenant’s dog for purposes of establishing liability under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.095ol15" target="_self">258.095(5)</a></cite> because the statute unambiguously stated that a person who permitted a dog to remain on the premises that he owned was deemed an owner for purposes of the dog-bite liability statute, and the landlords knew that the dog was on the leased premises, but did not take any affirmative steps to make sure the dog was removed from the property after revoking the tenant’s permission to keep it. Benningfield v. Zinsmeister, 367 S.W.3d 561, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 83</cite> (Ky. 2012).

        Although landlords were the statutory owners under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.235ol14" target="_self">258.235(4)</a></cite> of a tenant’s dog, they were not liable under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc258s258.095ol15" target="_self">258.095(5)</a></cite> for injuries a minor sustained when attacked by the dog because the dog attack occurred off the premises, and liability could only arise for attacks occurring on or about the premises. Benningfield v. Zinsmeister, 367 S.W.3d 561, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 83</cite> (Ky. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where ownership of a dog is premised on permission for the dog to remain on property, there must be an element of tenancy, even for a short period of time, in order to establish liability; therefore, liability would not extent to temporary excursions onto another’s property, even when done so with the landowner’s permission, for example when a dog entered a public park in which dogs were allowed. Benningfield v. Zinsmeister, 367 S.W.3d 561, 2012<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 83</cite> (Ky. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly instructed the jury to determine a dog owner's liability under a negligence standard because the proper inquiry was whether the owner had reason to anticipate the victim's presence or whether he failed to exercise ordinary care in controlling the dogs for the safety of others. Maupin v. Tankersley, 2016<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 165</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 16, 2016), rev'd, 540 S.W.3d 357, 2018<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 84</cite> (Ky. 2018).

        Language of subsection (4) is clear, but equally clear is the language of subsequent case law interpreting and applying that clear language; this case law applies a general negligence standard where an unexpected visitor wanders onto an owner's property and is attacked.

        Under this section the owner of hogs must restrain them from unenclosed lands and the landowner may recover for damages because of trespassing hogs in spite of the fact that he has not constructed a lawful fence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        After plaintiffs established that their automobile ran into a cow on the public highway and that defendant owned the cow, the defendant is required to come forward with the facts of how the cow got loose or permit the plaintiff’s prima facie case to go to the jury. Ellington v. Strader, 285 S.W.2d 497, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 81</cite> (Ky. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a person is damaged by an animal at large, the plaintiff has made a prima facie case by proving the accident and the defendant’s ownership or control. Campbell v. White, 357 S.W.2d 849, 1962<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 146</cite> (Ky. 1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The unexplained presence of a cow on a highway creates against the owner a rebuttable presumption of negligence. Sparks v. Doe, 379 S.W.2d 252, 1964<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 235</cite> (Ky. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence of the owner of the cattle presented to the jury a question of credibility as to whether or not he had inspected the fence and whether it was in rotten condition at a time prior to the accident when he either knew about it or should have known about it and should have repaired it, the question of the owner’s negligence was properly submitted to the jury. Oliver Trucking Co. v. Harris, 441 S.W.2d 775, 1969<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 330</cite> (Ky. 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The unexplained presence of livestock on the highway creates against the owner or custodian of the livestock a rebuttable presumption of negligence which will entitle an injured plaintiff to a directed verdict as to the defendant’s negligence unless the animal’s keeper adduces rebutting evidence on that issue. Rankin v. Blue Grass Boys Ranch, Inc., 469 S.W.2d 767, 1971<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 312</cite> (Ky. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the plaintiff presented evidence that a pony and a mule owned by the defendant were turned into a pasture but were on the adjoining road when the plaintiff hit the mule, such proof made out a prima facie case against the defendant. Rankin v. Blue Grass Boys Ranch, Inc., 469 S.W.2d 767, 1971<cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 312</cite> (Ky. 1971).

        Where animals owned by the defendant were on a road without explanation of how they got there although they might have gotten there by several means, it was not within the ambit of forbidden speculation for the jury to find that the animals escaped by reason of the defendant’s failure to exercise ordinary care to prevent their escape.

       Where cattle are roaming over a road which is not a county road, the owner of the cattle claims fee simple ownership of the road, and the cattle are contained on the landowner’s premises, including the road, by means of cattle guards, whether this section has been violated or not depends on the status of the road. If it is in fact the private property of the cattle’s owner, there is no violation; on the other hand, if the road has attained the status of a public road, then the other property owners along the road may have a cause of action.<cite class="OAG">OAG 88-59</cite>.

       Section 1. Statement of purpose, findings, and declaration of policy.
      </h4>
      <p>
       The purpose of this compact is to recognize the interstate character of the southern dairy industry and the prerogative of the states under the United States Constitution to form an interstate commission for the southern region. The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the South, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is an essential agricultural activity of the South. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors, and retailers, are an integral component of the region’s economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential, and they are an integral part of the region’s rural communities. The farms preserve land for agricultural purposes and provide needed economic stimuli for rural communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price that southern dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the southern dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the southern dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action had been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The system of federal orders, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum prices paid to producers for raw milk, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established.
      </p>
      <p>
       In today’s regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual, state action is needed to more effectively address the market disarray. Under our constitutional system, properly authorized states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region’s fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the system of federal orders nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the system of federal orders be discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission may regulate the marketplace in lieu of the system of federal orders. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the system of federal orders.

It is the intent of this compact to establish a basic structure by which the commission may achieve those purposes through the application, adaptation, and development of the regulatory techniques historically associated with milk marketing and to afford the commission broad flexibility to devise regulatory mechanisms to achieve the purposes of this compact. In accordance with this intent, the technical terms which are associated with market order regulation and which have acquired commonly understood general meanings are not defined in this compact, but the commission may further define the terms used in this compact and develop additional concepts and define additional terms as it may find appropriate to achieve its purposes.

      </span>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of a soil and water conservation district is to conserve and develop all renewable natural resources within the district. In so doing, the district is authorized to undertake, sponsor, or participate in projects and activities which promote the conservation, development, maintenance and use of the land, water, trees and other renewable natural resources of the district. Such projects and activities shall include but not be limited to conservation practices on agricultural lands, the control of soil erosion, retardation of water runoff, the construction of flood prevention and control reservoirs, the maintenance of flood plains, the promotion of projects to assure an adequate municipal, industrial and agricultural supply of water, watershed stabilization, the avoidance and abatement of sedimentation and pollution in streams and other bodies of water, forestation and reforestation, the establishment of parks and outdoor recreation areas, the protection of open space, greenbelt areas and scenery, the preservation of wilderness areas, the protection of fish and wildlife, working for the location of highways, industries, housing developments, airports and other structures as are consistent with the district’s objectives and will offer the least possible interference with the conservation and best multiple use of the renewable natural resources, and all other activities consistent with the total natural resources development of the district.

       This section, as amended in 1972 by ch. 99, § 3, seems to indicate from the use of the term “upon” that the fiscal court has the option of examining the budget of the board and that the budget provisions must be agreed to by the fiscal court and the board and it is only after formal approval of the budget by the court that it becomes mandatory upon it to provide the necessary operating funds.<cite class="OAG">OAG 72-335</cite>.

      <p>
       Under this section, as amended in 1980, once the district board’s budget has been submitted to and finally approved by the fiscal court, it is mandatory that the fiscal court fund the budget either from the county’s general fund or by levying the millage ad valorem tax, not to exceed $25,000 for a fiscal year, because subsection (4) of this section says that the funds “shall be supplied;” since the millage ad valorem tax is not a voted levy, and since the tax is characterized by subsection (4) of this section as a “county tax,” the roll-back restrictions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.245" target="_blank">68.245</a></cite> apply.<cite class="OAG">OAG 80-260</cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       The amendment of subsection (4) of this section to limit the maximum total tax revenue from real property millage tax to $25,000 per year does not unconstitutionally impact upon KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.11.html#tXIc132s132.023" target="_blank">132.023</a></cite>, since the General Assembly may constitutionally levy rates which lessen taxes.<cite class="OAG">OAG 81-174</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a soil conservation district had previously levied a real property tax on all taxable real estate parcels of five (5) acres or more, the amendment of subsection (4) of this section to tax all real property would not, as applied, distinguish between old and new property, including houses and lots under five acres.<cite class="OAG">OAG 81-174</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funds derived from a soil conservation tax imposed under this section are not included in the computation of the 4% increase in revenue permitted under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.245" target="_blank">68.245</a></cite>. Since the soil and water conservation tax is not subject to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.245" target="_blank">68.245</a></cite>, it necessarily follows that the revenue it produces should not be included in the calculations of permissible rates for other taxes that are subject to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.245" target="_blank">68.245</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 92-113</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tax authorized by this section is not subject to the rate rollback provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.245" target="_blank">68.245</a></cite>. Since this section’s tax already contains its own rollback provision, there is no need to subject it to the additional rollback mechanism in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.245" target="_blank">68.245</a></cite>. To do so would render the expressed $25,000 ceiling in this section meaningless.<cite class="OAG">OAG 92-113</cite> (overruling<cite class="OAG">OAG 80-260</cite> to the extent of conflict).

       A member of the board of supervisors of a conservation district is a local, subdivisional officer and may potentially receive per diem and expenses for serving as such and a state officer could not hold the supervisor’s position because of the prohibition of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.080ol11" target="_blank">61.080(1)</a></cite> and Ky.

       <p>
        A district may condemn land for projects built without federal aid, and it was not necessary for the trial court to join any federal officials or to make a final determination on condemnee’s allegations concerning federal law where federal funds had not yet been made available to district, since it was irrelevant at that time whether the benefits outweighed the cost under the federal formula or whether the environmental impact statement then existed.

       A watershed conservancy district, with its defined though limited powers of government, including the authority to tax, borrow money, issue bonds, purchase land and construct necessary structures, is a separate entity and not a department, instrumentality or agency of a city or county or of the commonwealth in the sense contemplated by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.37.html#tXXXVIIc416s416.560ol11" target="_blank">416.560(1)</a></cite>, (2) and (3).

       If there has been a general enhancement of values in the district by reason of watershed improvement projects, this can be sufficient basis for the board of supervisors to determine that the land in question is benefited and should not be detached from the district.<cite class="OAG">OAG 65-460</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as real property that it is claimed is not benefited remains within the area of the watershed conservancy district and is not detached pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc262s262.785" target="_self">262.785</a></cite>, the board of directors must levy the annual tax on the property at an equal rate with all other real property within the district.<cite class="OAG">OAG 65-460</cite>.

       Where a watershed conservancy district was established in 1957, but that district never levied taxes or otherwise became active, nevertheless it continues to exist as a public body corporate and must be dissolved under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc262s262.791" target="_self">262.791</a></cite> before a new district may be formed, unless the new district could be established under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIc262s262.707" target="_self">262.707</a></cite>, since this section forbids an area in one such district from being embraced in a second such district.<cite class="OAG">OAG 79-434</cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       Revenue bonds issued by a watershed conservancy district pursuant to KRS ch. 58 would not require a referendum before they can be issued, since they do not constitute an indebtedness of the political subdivision under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.07.html#tVIIc58s58.040" target="_blank">58.040</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG">OAG 63-637</cite>.

       Since the legislature, by this section, granted a watershed conservancy district condemnation power authorizing such districts to condemn land in the same manner as municipal corporations are permitted under subsection (2) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.37.html#tXXXVIIc416s416.115" target="_blank">416.115</a></cite> (repealed), it is apparent that it did not consider such districts to be municipal corporations under the terms of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.37.html#tXXXVIIc416s416.115" target="_blank">416.115</a></cite> (repealed).<cite class="OAG">OAG 70-517</cite>.

       A watershed conservancy district has no express power to sell surplus real estate.<cite class="OAG">OAG 71-129</cite>.

       Inasmuch as this section does not permit the issuance of bonds on a year-by-year basis, the board of directors of a watershed conservancy district could not submit a proposed bond issue adequate to meet the maintenance needs of the district over a period of 25 years where sufficient bonds would be sold each year to cover the maintenance costs for that particular year.<cite class="OAG">OAG 77-610</cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       A watershed conservancy district, with its defined though limited powers of government, including the authority to tax, borrow money, issue bonds, purchase land and construct necessary structures, is a separate entity and not a department, instrumentality or agency of a city or county or of the commonwealth in the sense contemplated by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.37.html#tXXXVIIc416s416.560ol11" target="_blank">416.560(1)</a></cite>, (2) and (3). A watershed conservancy district may, therefore, initiate condemnation proceedings on its own behalf, since KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.37.html#tXXXVIIc416s416.560ol11" target="_blank">416.560(1)</a></cite>, (2) and (3) have no application, assuming, of course, that the watershed conservancy district has received prior approval from the Board of Supervisors of the soil conservation district pursuant to this section.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-272</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of directors of a watershed conservancy district could apply to the fiscal court of the county for the necessary easement or flowage right to permit the flooding from time to time, at very infrequent times of heavy rains, of a certain portion of a county road and the fiscal court had the authority to execute an instrument of easement or flowage right covering such situation, as applicable to the specifically designated right-of-way of the subject county road. Moreover, in view of the authority and responsibility of the watershed conservancy district under subsection (2) of this section, such district would be required to acquire the easement or flowage right, or otherwise, necessary when private property holders’ lands would be likewise flooded in such situation.<cite class="OAG">OAG 82-540</cite>.

       It is the policy of the state to conserve, protect and to encourage development and improvement of its agricultural lands for the production of food and other agricultural products. It is also the policy of this state to conserve and protect the agricultural land base as a valuable natural resource which is both fragile and finite. The pressure imposed by urban expansion, transportation systems, water impoundments, surface mining of mineral resources, utility rights-of-way and industrial development has continually reduced the land resource base necessary to sufficiently produce food and fiber for our future needs.

       The Commonwealth is hereby authorized to acquire agricultural conservation easements or other property interests. The property interest acquired may be any less-than-fee-simple interest, including an easement, life estate, covenant, or other contractual right. Acquisition may be accomplished by purchase, gift, grant, bequest, devise, covenant, or contract but only at a price that is equal to or less than the appraised value as provided in this section. The Commonwealth shall purchase these property interests only upon voluntary application of the landowner.

       If the landowner so elects, the Commonwealth is authorized to pay the purchase price in a lump-sum single payment at the time of closing, to enter into contracts for pay outs over a term of years against the purchase price, or to enter into installment purchase agreements. When pay outs over time are made, the Commonwealth is authorized to pay interest consistent with prevailing market conditions at the time of the execution of the contract.
