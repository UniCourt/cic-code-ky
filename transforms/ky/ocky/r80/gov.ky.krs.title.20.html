        Allowing in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers in certain circumstances while prohibiting out-of-state wineries from doing the same has no differential effect on the shipment of wine into dry territories; the statutory scheme under former KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc241s241.010ol122" target="_self">241.010(22)</a></cite> and (45), KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.155ol12" target="_self">243.155(2)</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.156" target="_self">243.156</a></cite> (repealed effective January 1, 2007) discriminates based upon where the wine originates, not upon where it ends up; therefore, the in-state eligibility requirements are not narrowly tailored towards achieving temperance in dry territories.

        The exercise of such discretionary power as finding facts and administering the law, by the alcoholic beverage control board, is a quasi-judicial act, but not exercise of judicial power within the meaning of Const., §§ 27, 28 and 109. Keller v. Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Countrol Board, 279<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.272" target="_blank">Ky. 272</a></cite>, 130 S.W.2d 821, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS293" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 293</a></cite> (Ky. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, in authorizing the board to limit the number of licenses to be issued, and to restrict locations, does not delegate legislative authority in violation of the Constitution. Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Klein, 301<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.757" target="_blank">Ky. 757</a></cite>, 192 S.W.2d 735, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS531" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 531</a></cite> (Ky. 1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (6) of this section which gives the alcoholic beverage control board power to padlock a place of business upon the finding of a single violation of chapter 241 or chapter 244 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes is invalid. Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Jacobs, 269 S.W.2d 189, 1954<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS951" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 951</a></cite> (Ky. 1954) (decision prior to 1966 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the statute not only gives the alcoholic beverage control board authority to stop the sale of whiskey on the premises, but also confers upon it authority to prevent the premises from being used for any purpose, it amounts, in effect, to the taking of private property, which cannot be done even by the state without due process of law. Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Jacobs, 269 S.W.2d 189, 1954<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS951" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 951</a></cite> (Ky. 1954) (decision prior to 1966 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        While subsection (6) of this section which gives the alcoholic beverage control board power to padlock a place of business upon a finding of violation of certain statutes is not lacking in procedural due process, the failure of the statute to make the padlocking order contingent upon a finding by the board of the existence of a nuisance renders it unconstitutional. Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Jacobs, 269 S.W.2d 189, 1954<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS951" target="_blank">Ky.

        Legislature, under police power, could provide that board had right to adopt reasonable regulations regarding issuance of permits or licenses to prevent unlawful traffic in intoxicating liquor. Commonwealth v. Williams, 287<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.489" target="_blank">Ky. 489</a></cite>, 153 S.W.2d 985, 1941<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS569" target="_blank">Ky.

        The legislature has the power to limit the number of places at which alcoholic beverages may be purchased by the drink or by the package. Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Klein, 301<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.757" target="_blank">Ky. 757</a></cite>, 192 S.W.2d 735, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS531" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        The power of the state, with respect to the regulation of a traffic in alcoholic beverages, is supreme, and the fact that the state has not acted does not eliminate that power; therefore, any local regulation of the alcoholic beverage industry must be specifically authorized by either the General Assembly or the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. Whitehead v. Estate of Bravard, 719 S.W.2d 720, 1986<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS289" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 289</a></cite> (Ky. 1986).

        Where parties to a local option election contest stipulated to take no further proceedings until a certain date, both parties believing that liquor could not be sold after that date, the stipulation would not be set aside for mutual mistake because of a subsequent ruling by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, allowing liquor licenses to be issued after the stipulated date. Jett v. Holland, 276<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.718" target="_blank">Ky. 718</a></cite>, 124 S.W.2d 1055, 1939<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS572" target="_blank">Ky.

        A license application is not “on file with the board” merely because an application had been filed with the city administrator. Shearer v. Spadie, 260 S.W.2d 648, 1953<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS979" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 979</a></cite> (Ky. 1953).

        Under the alcoholic beverage control act the licensees have a privilege granted to them, but in no sense is a right given them to attack the broad power of the board to fix quotas.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where intoxicating liquor licenses are authorized, even though the regulating public body has a broad discretion in fixing the number, a restriction which constitutes an absolute or practical prohibition is unauthorized and arbitrary. Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Helm Hotel Cocktail Lounge, Inc., 357 S.W.2d 891, 1962<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS164" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 164</a></cite> (Ky. 1962).

        The alcoholic beverage control board must be governed by its own regulations. Although it has broad discretion in the administration of alcoholic beverage control, and has authority to adopt reasonable regulations, the rules it promulgated must conform to some standard and must have some stability of operation. Krenitz v. Baron, 252 S.W.2d 58, 1952<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS987" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 987</a></cite> (Ky. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        The alcoholic beverage control board may regulate generally under the provisions of this section where the regulation is in the limits set by statute, but the regulations adopted must not exceed the specific powers delegated to the board by the legislature. Oertel Brewing Co. v. Portwood, 320 S.W.2d 317, 1959<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS234" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 234</a></cite> (Ky. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the legislature by this section vested the alcoholic beverage control board with certain regulatory and administrative powers board does not have authority to adopt regulations extending beyond the scope of statutes which it attempts to administer. Roppel v. Shearer, 321 S.W.2d 36, 1959<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS254" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 254</a></cite> (Ky. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The regulatory power conferred by this section upon the board does not give the board the right to place rules in force that exceed the limitations of the particular statute it undertakes to administer. Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Hunter, 331 S.W.2d 280, 1960<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS119" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 119</a></cite> (Ky. 1960).

        Where voters in county local option election voted to legalize sale of alcoholic beverages and the county was allotted a quota of retail package liquor licenses and the number of applicants substantially outnumbered the quota, letter sent to all applicants that explained the criteria that would be used to determine successful applicants, not only permitted the administrator to exercise discretion in his selection but also put the applicants on notice as to what factors the administrator would consider before making a decision; a regulation adopted pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc13" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> (now repealed) could do no more and moreover, it would be difficult for the board to promulgate regulations adopting definite criteria to be applied in every case because criteria may differ according to locale.

        Although KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.130" target="_self">243.130</a></cite> specifically prohibited promotional activities for the sale of alcoholic beverages on the part of distillers, rectifiers, and vintners and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc244s244.050" target="_self">244.050</a></cite> prohibited similar activities by any retail licensee but there was no statute prohibiting such activities on the part of brewers and beer distributors, alcoholic beverage control board was not authorized to adopt a regulation prohibiting the promotion of alcoholic beverage brands by brewers and distributors in retail stores for enactment of specific statutory legislation in the field as to distillers, rectifiers, vintners and retail licensees dispels any notion that the legislature impliedly delegated to the board power to legislate similarly as to brewers and beer distributors. Oertel Brewing Co. v. Portwood, 320 S.W.2d 317, 1959<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS234" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 234</a></cite> (Ky. 1959).

        Since the legislature did not by statute prohibit retailers of malt beverages from selling for credit, taking orders by telephone or from making deliveries the alcoholic beverage control board cannot do so by regulation. Roppel v. Shearer, 321 S.W.2d 36, 1959<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS254" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 254</a></cite> (Ky. 1959).

        The legislature in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.040" target="_self">243.040</a></cite> dealt directly with the problem of incompatibility of licenses, which established a legislative intent not to prohibit cross-licensing in the areas not expressly prescribed; therefore, the Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Board exceeded its authority by issuing a regulation prohibiting interlocking interests between malt beverage wholesalers, distributors and manufacturers.

       An urban-county ordinance requiring a $.05 refund on all beverage containers would not be preempted by statutes or regulations of the department of alcoholic beverage control since there is nothing in the language of this section to indicate that restrictions of some sort cannot be applied to beverage containers, especially where the regulation has nothing to do with the alcoholic nature of the beverage and since the alcoholic beverage control board has jurisdiction over only a segment of the types of beverages, i.e., alcoholic beverages, included in such a proposed bottle bill.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG80-502" target="_blank">OAG 80-502</a></cite>.

       Where a resolution limiting by regulation the number of licenses of each kind or class for the county was not approved by the state alcoholic beverage control board, an attempted limitation on the local alcoholic beverage licenses by the county fiscal court was without authority and was invalid.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG64-905" target="_blank">OAG 64-905</a></cite>.

       If the county judge (now county judge/executive), who is also the county administrator, leaves the county and state for an extended time and the circuit judge does not appoint an interim administrator, the ABC board would be authorized to go ahead and issue a county license.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG65-471" target="_blank">OAG 65-471</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county judge (now county judge/executive) who has appointed himself county administrator leaves the county and the state for a prolonged period of time during which time licenses must be renewed, he has disqualified himself from acting as administrator until his return and the circuit judge can appoint an interim county administrator.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG65-471" target="_blank">OAG 65-471</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       The county judge/executive has no authority to act as the local alcoholic beverage control administrator if the fiscal court has failed to pass a resolution declaring that regulation of traffic in alcoholic beverages is necessary, since a resolution of this type is a condition precedent to the assumption of authority as alcoholic beverage control administrator by the county judge/executive.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG83-63" target="_blank">OAG 83-63</a></cite>.

       A county cannot collect license fees from package store owners in a city of the first four classes for the authority for issuing such licenses rests exclusively with the city authorities to the absolute exclusion of the county authorities.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG61-31" target="_blank">OAG 61-31</a></cite>.

       Although there is no statutory prohibition against appointing as city alcoholic beverage administrator an insurance agent representing a company presently doing business with the city and who may do business with the city in the future, there would be a common-law conflict of interest.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-33" target="_blank">OAG 74-33</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A councilman in a fourth-class city may be assigned the duties of alcoholic beverage control administrator for the city and receive compensation from both positions but he should not vote on either the question of his selection as alcoholic beverage control administrator or on the compensation fixed for the performance of the additional duties assigned to him, as this might create a common-law conflict of interest.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-68" target="_blank">OAG 74-68</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A member of the city council may serve concurrently as the city alcoholic beverage commissioner if such duties are assigned by the city council to one of the council members, but if the office of alcoholic beverage commissioner is created by ordinance, the office is a municipal office and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.080" target="_blank">61.080</a></cite> and Ky Const., § 165 prohibit a person from filling two municipal offices at the same time.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-82" target="_blank">OAG 74-82</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where councilman is assigned duties of alcoholic beverage control administrator under this section, such assignment did not violate KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.080" target="_blank">61.080</a></cite> in that said councilman would not be occupying two city offices at the same time, since the council was assigning the duties of the office and not creating a new office.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-292" target="_blank">OAG 74-292</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A member of a town board of trustees can be legally assigned the duties of the office of alcoholic beverage control administrator under authority of this section as the board member would not be holding another municipal office in violation of Ky. Const. § 165 and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.080" target="_blank">61.080</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-576" target="_blank">OAG 74-576</a></cite>.
      </p>

       If a city creates a separate office of alcoholic beverage control administrator or assigns the duties of the office to a present city office, such as mayor or city council member, such action must be taken by ordinance.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG76-97" target="_blank">OAG 76-97</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An ordinance which created the office of city alcoholic control administrator in a fourth class city and vested the powers and duties of the administrator in the mayor was in violation of this section, which provides that such office may either be created or its duties assigned to an existing office, and also violated subsection (3) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.080" target="_blank">61.080</a></cite> and Const., § 165 which prohibit any person from filling two municipal offices at the same time; however, the city council could amend or revise the ordinance to state that the duties of the administrator should be assigned to the office of the mayor, thereby avoiding the creation of a separate municipal office.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG81-390" target="_blank">OAG 81-390</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fifth-class city has the authority to enact an ordinance imposing license fees on the manufacturing and trafficking of alcoholic beverages; the administration of such licenses is the responsibility of the county alcoholic beverage administrator.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG84-117" target="_blank">OAG 84-117</a></cite>.

        Under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc241s241.200" target="_self">241.200</a></cite>, a liquor store owner was entitled to an administrative hearing on an applicant’s request for liquor license; therefore, the trial court properly remanded the case to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the city administrator’s issuance of the license violated KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.450" target="_self">243.450</a></cite> because the applicant’s premises did not comply with the city’s regulations.

        Where plaintiff’s liquor license had been renewed by the city alcoholic beverage control administrator and was subsequently withdrawn by the city council by a letter from the city clerk-treasurer, court erred in dismissing complaint, since the issue was not merely administrative discretion but a question of law involving withdrawal of the administrator’s approval by deference to the city council.

        NOTES TO DECISIONS
       </span>
      </h4>
      <p>
       KRS Ch. 242, being substantially a reenactment of the old local option law, would be controlled by construction placed on old law. Long v. Smith, 281<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.512" target="_blank">Ky. 512</a></cite>, 136 S.W.2d 789, 1940<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS74" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 74</a></cite> (Ky. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       One charged with selling or trafficking in liquor in local option territory must be prosecuted under this chapter and not under the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, KRS ch. 241. Strunk v. Commonwealth, 302<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.284" target="_blank">Ky. 284</a></cite>, 194 S.W.2d 504, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS649" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 649</a></cite> (Ky. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is mandatory, but the jurisdiction of the court is not defeated because the judge refuses to observe the mandatory provisions of the statute. Bays v. Bradley Mills, 254 S.W.2d 348, 1953<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS585" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 585</a></cite> (Ky. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent some special issue as to the existence of local option, the trial court will take judicial notice of the county’s status in this respect. Rogers v. Commonwealth, 424 S.W.2d 130, 1968<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS445" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 445</a></cite> (Ky. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is apparent that in all its manifestations this section is procedural and merely provides a vehicle to set in motion procedures to call an election where authorized by the substantive portion of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242" target="_self">Chapter 242</a></cite>, that is, KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.125" target="_self">242.125</a></cite>. Howard v. Salyer, 695 S.W.2d 420, 1985<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS247" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 247</a></cite> (Ky. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature meant by “territory” or “territory to be affected,” first a county, second a city, third a district, and fourth a precinct. Herron v. McMurray, 303<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.190" target="_blank">Ky. 190</a></cite>, 197 S.W.2d 55, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS803" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 803</a></cite> (Ky. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       A city of the first four classes is a “territory” and is an independent unit for the purpose of voting and determining its status on the prohibition question. However, with respect to the calling of a county-wide election a city is simply a segment of the county. Mastin v. Cornett, 373 S.W.2d 424, 1963<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS159" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 159</a></cite> (Ky. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The form of the issue, as stated in the petition, need not conform literally to the form of the question on the ballot. Hessler v. Garner, 266<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.507" target="_blank">Ky. 507</a></cite>, 99 S.W.2d 461, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS693" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 693</a></cite> (Ky. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       The units of a petition need not be bound together. Wilson v. Lawrence, 268<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.179" target="_blank">Ky. 179</a></cite>, 103 S.W.2d 955, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS427" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 427</a></cite> (Ky. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petition need not state that county has not had local option election within three years. Morgan v. Walker, 289<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.92" target="_blank">Ky. 92</a></cite>, 158 S.W.2d 5, 1941<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS23" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 23</a></cite> (Ky. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary that each sheet of the petition contain a caption identifying its purpose. Hessler v. Garner, 266<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.507" target="_blank">Ky. 507</a></cite>, 99 S.W.2d 461, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS693" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 693</a></cite> (Ky. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is necessary to set forth the purpose of the petition, including a description of the territory in which the election is to be held, and it is sufficient to do this at the beginning of the first page of each unit. Karloftis v. Mills, 312<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.722" target="_blank">Ky. 722</a></cite>, 229 S.W.2d 477, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS746" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 746</a></cite> (Ky. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order reciting the filing of the petition with the clerk is not required by the statute. Epperson v. Harper, 271<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.326" target="_blank">Ky. 326</a></cite>, 112 S.W.2d 45, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS243" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 243</a></cite> (Ky. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Presentation of the petition to the clerk will be treated as a filing thereof. Rodgers v. Campbell, 267<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.261" target="_blank">Ky. 261</a></cite>, 101 S.W.2d 937, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS301" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 301</a></cite> (Ky. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       The petition need not be filed during a regular term, but may be filed with the clerk at any time. Goodwin v. Anderson, 269<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.11" target="_blank">Ky. 11</a></cite>, 106 S.W.2d 152, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS566" target="_blank">Ky.

    Barger v. Ward, 407 S.W.2d 397, 1966<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS152" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 152</a></cite> (Ky. 1966); Campbell v.

LEXIS 644</a></cite> (Ky. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order calling an election which recites that the petition had been “lodged and received by the court” is not evidence that the petition was not duly filed with the clerk. Epperson v. Harper, 271<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.326" target="_blank">Ky. 326</a></cite>, 112 S.W.2d 45, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS243" target="_blank">Ky.

       When petition is filed with the clerk and the court calls election pursuant to petition, it will be presumed that court was satisfied that signers of petition were legal voters. Hawkins v.

       Voters residing in magisterial districts which had been rendered dry by magisterial district elections were qualified to sign petition demanding a local option election in every voting precinct in county except specified cities, since they were voters of territory to be affected.

       Where county judge (now county judge/executive) did not show himself to be qualified as a handwriting expert, he had no authority, on the basis of his own comparison of the signatures on the petition with the signatures on the registration books of the county, to strike names from the petition on the ground that the signatures were not genuine, particularly where there was direct positive testimony by the persons in question that they did sign the petition.

       In the absence of a showing that the county judge (now county judge/executive) was sufficiently acquainted with signatures to qualify as an expert, his decision that certain signatures should be stricken is not entitled to any weight.

       If the county judge/executive is satisfied with the petition for a local option election prima facie, or has personal knowledge without hearing evidence, that signatures and petitioners are what and whom they purport to be, and constitute the required percent of voters, he is authorized to order the election.

       Where there were 46 separate papers or units of petition for local option election circulated over the county and the number of voters signing all these petitions aggregated the sum of approximately 2,200 and clerk on receipt of the bundle of petitions placed his indorsement on the back of the outside petition there was substantial compliance with the statutory requirements and contention that only the petition indorsed by the clerk could be counted was in error. Rodgers v. Campbell, 267<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.261" target="_blank">Ky. 261</a></cite>, 101 S.W.2d 937, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS301" target="_blank">Ky.

      </p>
      <p>
       A local option election ballot designating voting precinct by name only, was not fatally defective for failure to set out precinct number and name of county, where election order, signed by the county judge (now county judge/executive), directing the sheriff to advertise order in county newspaper, and post notices in precinct, clearly identified the county and the precinct number, and there was no evidence that voters did not know location of precinct. Robinson v. Spradlin, 303<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.451" target="_blank">Ky. 451</a></cite>, 197 S.W.2d 919, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS866" target="_blank">Ky.

       Voters living in magisterial districts which were dry territory by reason of previous district elections were qualified voters of the “territory to be affected” within the meaning of this section, as concerned petition for county-wide local option election, notwithstanding that adoption of county-wide prohibition would not change status in such districts. Widick v. Pursifull, 299<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.773" target="_blank">Ky. 773</a></cite>, 187 S.W.2d 447, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS791" target="_blank">Ky.

       The legislature did not intend that the voters of one district, city, or precinct could petition for an election in another city, district, or precinct. Herron v.

       There is nothing in the words of this section to suggest a legislative intent that a precinct once established is irrevocably fixed in perpetuity as a local option voting unit. Reeves v.

       Where the county voted dry as a unit, another vote on the question by less than the county unit would be contrary to law. Stice v. Milliken, 343 S.W.2d 824, 1961<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS440" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 440</a></cite> (Ky. 1961).

       It is not mandatory that the order be made at the current or next regular term, it being permissible to make the order at a subsequent regular term, yet it must be done a sufficient length of time before the election is held to amount to a substantial compliance with the statute.

       Where a proper petition for a local option election was filed during a special term of the county court and an order calling an election was immediately entered, and, during the second succeeding regular term, the county judge (now county judge/executive) withdrew the void order (an order calling an election must be entered during a regular term), but refused to permit petitioners to withdraw the petition and refile same, or to sustain their motion to enter an order calling an election based upon the petition as originally filed, mandamus issued directing county judge (now county judge/executive) to follow the latter procedure. Martin v. Cheek, 309<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.319" target="_blank">Ky. 319</a></cite>, 217 S.W.2d 785, 1949<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS700" target="_blank">Ky.

       Where a county judge fails to comply with the mandatory provisions of this section and does not call an election at the current or next regular term after the filing of the petition, this failure should be regarded as a clerical misprision which may be corrected as such.

       Since present statute does not except druggists as did former law, clause “shall apply to druggists” in the court order calling an election under this section is mere surplusage and did not invalidate the court order.

White, 266<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.648" target="_blank">Ky. 648</a></cite>, 99 S.W.2d 785, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS730" target="_blank">Ky.

       When the order calling the election is not recorded upon the order book until after the election is held, the election is void. Hardigree v. White, 266<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.648" target="_blank">Ky. 648</a></cite>, 99 S.W.2d 785, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS730" target="_blank">Ky.

       The fact that the judge did not sign the order book until after the election is not fatal. Hardigree v. White, 266<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.648" target="_blank">Ky. 648</a></cite>, 99 S.W.2d 785, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS730" target="_blank">Ky.

      </p>
      <p>
       Local option election was not void because county judge (now county judge/executive) failed to sign order book before election, where he signed original order before entry and also signed order book after election. Harris v. Cannon, 304<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.3" target="_blank">Ky. 3</a></cite>, 199 S.W.2d 429, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS927" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 927</a></cite> (Ky. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of the county court, at the term at which petition was filed, to enter an order on the order book noting the filing of the petition, did not render the election void, where the court, on the first day of the next regular term, had entered an order calling the election and filing the petition. Hall v. Sturgill, 305<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.445" target="_blank">Ky. 445</a></cite>, 204 S.W.2d 496, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS827" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 827</a></cite> (Ky. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the order calling the election was misdated is not fatal, since it can be shown that it was actually made at a regular term. Campbell v. Mason, 269<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.128" target="_blank">Ky. 128</a></cite>, 106 S.W.2d 100, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS555" target="_blank">Ky.

      <p>
       A judgment nunc pro tunc calling an election cannot be entered after the election is held when no prior entry of record of any kind has been made. Hardigree v. White, 266<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.648" target="_blank">Ky. 648</a></cite>, 99 S.W.2d 785, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS730" target="_blank">Ky.

       An election should be called by the county court of the county, the larger portion of whose territory was embraced by the town. Ray v. Spiers, 281<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.549" target="_blank">Ky. 549</a></cite>, 136 S.W.2d 750, 1940<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS65" target="_blank">Ky.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the judge has found the petition is regular, the calling of the election is merely ministerial, and the entry of such an order may be made retroactively so long as the actual entry of the order precedes the date of the election. Bays v. Bradley Mills, 254 S.W.2d 348, 1953<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS585" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 585</a></cite> (Ky. 1953).

       It was the intention of the legislature to treat a city election as one to be held as a unit in all the precincts embracing that city. Howard v. Carty, 275 S.W.2d 68, 1955<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS349" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 349</a></cite> (Ky. 1955).

      <p>
       The phrase “qualified voter” as used in this section means a voter who is constitutionally qualified and properly registered, so that a person who signs a local option petition must be 18 years of age, a resident of the state for one year, of the county for six months, and of the precinct for 60 days as prescribed by Ky Const., § 145, and be a duly registered voter, but need not have voted in the last election.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG66-190" target="_blank">OAG 66-190</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While under subsection (1) of this section, a petition may consist of one or more separate units, each unit should clearly indicate that it is part of a single petition calling for a local option election on a certain date.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG66-190" target="_blank">OAG 66-190</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a county-wide local option election, cities of the first four classes vote separately and are not controlled by the vote in the rest of the county.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG66-309" target="_blank">OAG 66-309</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once an entire county has voted dry, no smaller unit of that county can hold a separate election for voting wet except for cities of the first four classes. Accordingly, a county court should not order a local option election to be held in a county that has voted dry even though the petition filed with the court meets all the requirements of this section.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG70-500" target="_blank">OAG 70-500</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the addresses following the names on a petition are not specific, such signatures should be counted in determining the number of valid signatures unless the names are challenged.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG73-64" target="_blank">OAG 73-64</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a petition for the holding of a local option election has been filed with the county court clerk, the petition containing the signatures of the petitioners becomes a record of the county clerk and the petition signer no longer possesses the right to enjoin or prohibit the use of his name without his consent, so that a citizen or a group of citizens could obtain all of the names on a local option petition calling for an election on the sale of alcoholic beverages and publish the names of the signers without the consent of the signers.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG73-134" target="_blank">OAG 73-134</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the boundaries of a precinct are changed in order to decrease the number of registered voters to the legal maximum of 700 as provided by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.10.html#tXc127s127.050" target="_blank">127.050</a></cite> (repealed), a local option election can be validly called in the new precinct only upon a petition of qualified voters of the new precinct equal to 25 percent of the votes cast by the voters in the new precinct at the last preceding general election.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG73-300" target="_blank">OAG 73-300</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no time limit as to when a petition must be filed after the first petitioner signs the petition, but all signers of the petitions for local option elections must be registered voters so that the signature of anyone who has moved out of the territory or who has died prior to the filing date of the local option election petition cannot be considered the signature of a “constitutionally qualified voter.”<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG73-707" target="_blank">OAG 73-707</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A local option election may not be held for an annexed portion of a city where the portion is less than a whole precinct as the smallest division encompassed by the term “territory” is a precinct.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-451" target="_blank">OAG 74-451</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, subsequent to local option election in city in which city voted “wet,” territory was annexed to city, application for a malt beverage license should have been denied since the annexed territory encompassing the location of the business for which the malt beverage license was being sought remained “dry” after becoming annexed to the city and an election would have to be held in the entire precinct encompassing the annexed territory and therefore in the location of the business for which the malt beverage license was sought in order to redetermine the local option status of the annexed territory, including the business location in question.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG76-644" target="_blank">OAG 76-644</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any part of a “wet” magisterial district that is subsequently reapportioned into another magisterial district will remain “wet” and any part of a “dry” magisterial district that is subsequently reapportioned to another magisterial district will remain “dry.”<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG77-10" target="_blank">OAG 77-10</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holding of a city-wide election which produces a vote against prohibition does not prevent a local option election from thereafter being held in any precinct of the city.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG79-382" target="_blank">OAG 79-382</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smallest area considered and defined as a territory is a precinct and no smaller political unit or area of a city or county can hold a local option election.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG79-382" target="_blank">OAG 79-382</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where three commercial liquor establishments located in a county precinct about to have a local option election were annexed by a “wet” city the day before the election, they were no longer a part of that precinct and would be unaffected by the outcome of the election.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG79-580" target="_blank">OAG 79-580</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A voter who signs a petition for a local option election must indicate his address opposite his name for identification purposes that can either be his exact residence or a post office address, since such designation has been held to be directory rather than mandatory and the clerk may exercise his own discretion as to whether the designation is sufficient in order to identify the petitioner as a qualified voter.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG80-431" target="_blank">OAG 80-431</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition for a local option election is a public record and may be inspected by any person and the petition may be published in a newspaper or in any other manner, including the names of the persons who signed the petition; unless a person purported to have signed a petition has had the court declare that his name was placed on the petition without the person’s authority and should therefore be removed, the person has no legal recourse if his name is made public as a signer of the petition and there is no liability for the disclosure of the petition and the names thereon.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG80-450" target="_blank">OAG 80-450</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a local option election is confined to the corporate limits of the city, only those qualified voters residing within the city are entitled to sign the petition or to vote in the election; the clerk, in sending out the registration lists to the split precincts, should indicate which voters live within or without the city so that the election officers can lockout the local option election for those voters who may appear but who are not entitled to vote in the city election by virtue of being nonresidents.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG80-466" target="_blank">OAG 80-466</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a local option petition is filed, it is the responsibility of the clerk, on behalf of the county judge/executive who calls the election, to check the petition to see if the correct percentage of the qualified voters have signed as required by this section; following the filing of the petition it can be challenged in court by any qualified voter in opposition to the election.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG80-466" target="_blank">OAG 80-466</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A local option election petition must be signed by voters who are duly registered and thereby presumed to be constitutionally qualified to vote.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG80-492" target="_blank">OAG 80-492</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the county judge/executive who is responsible for examining the petition for a local option election on its face to determine whether the petition is correctly filed under the express terms of this section, but the county judge/executive can call on the clerk to assist him in comparing the petition with the voters’ registration data on file in the clerk’s office; where the county judge/executive has good reason to believe that a particular signature is not genuine, he may ask the person with that name to voluntarily come to the county judge/executive’s office to give evidence about it, one way or the other, and if it appears to the county judge/executive, after such evidence, that someone other than the so-called petitioner signed his name without authority, the county judge/executive may eliminate such name by an order in his executive order book, and such signature will not be counted as a petitioner.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG80-495" target="_blank">OAG 80-495</a></cite>; 82-538.
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as it appears a signer is a constitutionally qualified voter in the county and that he signed his own name, a misstatement as to his residence would not be a basis for the county judge/executive’s ordering the elimination of that name from the local option election petition.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG80-495" target="_blank">OAG 80-495</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county judge/executive has no authority to issue subpoenas in connection with the examination of a petition for a local option election.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG80-495" target="_blank">OAG 80-495</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smallest territory in which a local option election may be held is a precinct.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG81-399" target="_blank">OAG 81-399</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition for a local option election is to be kept by the county clerk, as he is the one with whom the petition is required to be filed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG83-134" target="_blank">OAG 83-134</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county clerk cannot be held liable in a civil suit for making a petition for a local option election available to the public for inspection or having a copy made since, by law, it becomes a public record when it is filed subject to both inspection and copying; the mere fact that the petition is subsequently declared invalid for insufficient compliance with the statute would have no bearing on the clerk’s civil liability.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG83-134" target="_blank">OAG 83-134</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a petition for a local option election is filed and duly recorded, it becomes a public record irrespective of whether or not it is found to meet the statutory requirements for validity and cannot be withdrawn. Thus, where the petition was ruled invalid for not containing a sufficient number of signatures, those favoring a referendum on the subject would be required to start over and submit an entirely new petition.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG83-134" target="_blank">OAG 83-134</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the petitioner is registered to vote prior to the filing of the petition, his signature should be counted as a valid signature, even though at the time he may have signed the petition he had not registered.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG85-60" target="_blank">OAG 85-60</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition is valid if it contains sufficient information to determine if a sufficient number of qualified voters request the election, regardless of whether the petition strictly complies with the provisions of the statute.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-174" target="_blank">OAG 91-174</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a petition could be valid despite the omission of Social Security numbers, it necessarily follows that an irregularity in the inclusion of the numbers, such as using voter’s files from the clerk’s office to add the numbers to the signed petition, would not necessarily invalidate the petition.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-174" target="_blank">OAG 91-174</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The complete omission of a Social Security number or date of birth would not necessarily invalidate a petition, as long as the county judge/executive can make the required determination of whether a sufficient number of voters request the election.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-174" target="_blank">OAG 91-174</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The petition must state the petitioner’s address, and the date on which he signed, and either the petitioner’s Social Security number or date of birth.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-174" target="_blank">OAG 91-174</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the date may be omitted entirely without disqualification of the voter’s signature, it follows that a mere alteration to the date does not necessarily disqualify the petition or the signature.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-204" target="_blank">OAG 91-204</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the signers were in fact registered as of the original date on the petition and not the altered date, then the names may be counted.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-204" target="_blank">OAG 91-204</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A local option petition may be supplemented at any time before the county judge/executive has made a determination regarding the sufficiency of the petition. After the county judge/executive has determined that the petition either is or is not sufficient, the petitioners may not tender supplemental signatures.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-132" target="_blank">OAG 92-132</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The petition is filed with the clerk, since the clerk is the official custodian of such records, and the clerk then delivers the petition to the county judge/executive.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-132" target="_blank">OAG 92-132</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The petitioner must state his social security number or date of birth. If this information is given, the clerk should be able to determine the identity of the person signing even though the actual signature may be illegible. Therefore an illegible signature should be disallowed only if the clerk or the county judge/executive is unable to determine the petitioner’s identity after consulting the other information given on the petition.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-132" target="_blank">OAG 92-132</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of the local option statute requiring petitioners to state their address and date of signing were “directory” rather than mandatory, and therefore the names of petitioners should be counted even if they omitted the address or date entirely.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-132" target="_blank">OAG 92-132</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, in conjunction with the general law on petitions, requires that a petitioner be a qualified voter both at the time the petition is signed and at the time it is filed.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG92-132" target="_blank">OAG 92-132</a></cite>.

        The purpose of this section, in requiring that at least 60 days elapse after filing of petition before holding of local option election, is to give ample time for investigation of signers of petition to determine validity of signatures. Therefore trial court, in contest of local option election, did not err in failing to grant contestants more than five days additional time in which to take proof concerning insufficiency of signatures on petition.

        The county court may order the election held on a date other than that named in the petition, provided it is not earlier than 60 nor later than 90 days after the filing of the petition and the court’s discretion in selecting a suitable date is not abused.

       </p>
       <p>
        Election may be held earlier than 60 days after the date of entry of the order calling the election, since this section only prohibits holding the election earlier than 60 days after the date the petition is filed.

        The county judge (now county judge/executive) has the right to fix the date for the election, within the statutory period. Harris v.

        Under Ky. Const. § 61, the General Assembly was given the authority to determine policy and draft laws regulating alcohol, and to that end, the General Assembly drafted KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.030" target="_self">242.030</a></cite> setting forth the requirements for a local option election about whether the sale of alcohol would be permitted and dictating that no local option election could be held in the same territory more than once in every three years. Accordingly, the precinct could not hold a local option election approximately five weeks after one had just been held, as KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.010" target="_self">242.010</a></cite> barred counties within which the precincts were located from holding a local option election so soon after the last local option election.

        Contestants had burden of showing that election held three days before local option election was “regular political election.” Buchanan v. Clark, 275<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.311" target="_blank">Ky. 311</a></cite>, 121 S.W.2d 681, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS413" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Election of members of school board is a “regular political election”; hence local option election held seven days after school election would be set aside. Norton v. Letton, 271<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.353" target="_blank">Ky. 353</a></cite>, 111 S.W.2d 1053, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS242" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Since election to fill vacancy caused by resignation of congressman was a “special” and not a “regular political election,” holding of local option election in same territory within 30 days thereafter did not violate subsection (3) of this section. Buchanan v. Clark, 275<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.311" target="_blank">Ky. 311</a></cite>, 121 S.W.2d 681, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS413" target="_blank">Ky.

        Where local option election was held in precinct and a year later such an election was held in the county the two elections were not held in the same territory in violation of subsection (5) of this section. Bennett v. Day, 271<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.676" target="_blank">Ky. 676</a></cite>, 113 S.W.2d 38, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS43" target="_blank">Ky.

        County election on question of adoption of local option law did not bar similar election in subdivision of county or city in county within three years following county election. Long v.

        The statute prohibiting a second vote within three years has reference to an election in the identical territory. Franklin v.

        Where election was held in entire magisterial district the result being against prohibition, an election less than three years later in three precincts of the district the result being for prohibition was not prohibited by subsection (5) of this section.

        Three (3)-year moratorium on local option elections provided for in subsection (5) of this section did not apply to a precinct located within a fourth class city which had voted to abolish prohibition; a precinct within a fourth class city is not the same territory as the city. Parrott v. Belcher, 884 S.W.2d 634, 1994<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS25" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 25</a></cite> (Ky. 1994).

       <p>
        Voters of individual precincts of a county not containing a city of the first four (4) classes which had abolished prohibition had the right to separately vote, without regard to the three (3)-year moratorium, whether it should reinstate prohibition.

        Publication of newspaper notices on July 8 and July 15, followed by posting of printed handbills, for election called for September 16, was a substantial compliance with this section, it not being required that the publication and posting be done during the two weeks immediately preceding the election.

        The posting and publishing by the sheriff of his synopsis of order calling election instead of the order itself rendered election invalid, and his signature to his synopsis did not give it verity.

        When local option election is held in a city, the posting of five notices, plus publication in a newspaper, is sufficient notice. Dance v.

        Where September 16 was last day for posting notices of local option election, and, with the exception of seven (7) precincts, such notices had been posted in time, but in six (6) of the seven (7) precincts notices were posted between 12 o’clock and 1 a.m. on September 17, and in other precinct they were posted on the afternoon of September 17, there was a substantial compliance with this section. Hall v. Sturgill, 305<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.445" target="_blank">Ky. 445</a></cite>, 204 S.W.2d 496, 1947<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS827" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        This section is mandatory as to the publication and posting of the notices of an election, but the provision is directory only, and a substantial compliance therewith is sufficient. Hall v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the sheriff admitted that he failed to post any handbills prior to a special local option election in a city, the trial court erred in holding the election valid since it was mandatory that the election be advertised by both types of publication required in this section. The election was invalid for improper advertisement despite the extensive publicity that the impending election received which resulted in the voters being adequately informed. Chumley v. Williams, 639 S.W.2d 557, 1982<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS252" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 252</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).

        Even if sheriff’s written report of posting of notices was not sufficient to meet requirement of this section, negative testimony of 25 witnesses that they had failed to see the requisite number of notices in any one precinct, and that in some precincts they had failed to see any notices, was insufficient to overcome the positive testimony of the sheriff and his deputies that they had posted the notices in each precinct as required by this section. Donohue v. Swindler, 299<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.119" target="_blank">Ky. 119</a></cite>, 184 S.W.2d 348, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS1031" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        In local option election contest, testimony of various witnesses from all sections of county, that they failed to see any notices of the election in any public place prior to election, was negative evidence, and insufficient to overcome weight of returns, positive testimony of deputies that notices were duly posted, and testimony of numerous witnesses that they saw posted notices. Booth v. McKenzie, 302<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.215" target="_blank">Ky. 215</a></cite>, 194 S.W.2d 63, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS609" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        In suit contesting local option election, negative testimony by contestant’s witnesses that they failed to see any notices posted in public places or elsewhere during two-week period prior to election, was insufficient to overcome positive testimony of sheriff and deputies that notices were posted in five conspicuous places in each precinct over 14 days before election. Harris v. Cannon, 304<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.3" target="_blank">Ky. 3</a></cite>, 199 S.W.2d 429, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS927" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the places selected by officers for posting notice of local option election were not the most conspicuous, but were at least public places, the court was not convinced that such places were so inconspicuous as to fail to meet the requirements of this section, especially since the city wherein the election was held was small and nearly 1,000 people out of a total population of 2,375 voted in the election. Ligon v. Beeny, 258 S.W.2d 454, 1953<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS828" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 828</a></cite> (Ky. 1953).

       <p>
        The doctrine of substantial compliance may be used to uphold the validity of a local option election if the appropriate authority attempts to comply with the statutory prerequisites concerning notice, but the compliance is in some way defective. However, where an official makes no effort to comply with the statute, that failure is fatal and the doctrine of substantial compliance cannot be utilized. Chumley v.

       <p>
        A sheriff’s report that he “has had such bills posted” is sufficient, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Campbell v. Mason, 269<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.128" target="_blank">Ky. 128</a></cite>, 106 S.W.2d 100, 1937<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS555" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 555</a></cite> (Ky. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the statute requires the sheriff to report in writing to the county court that such notices have been published and posted, yet such provision is not mandatory, and the failure of the sheriff to technically comply with the statute in that respect will not render the election invalid. Hawkins v. Walton, 271<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.487" target="_blank">Ky. 487</a></cite>, 112 S.W.2d 661, 1938<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS3" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 3</a></cite> (Ky. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Report of sheriff stating “Executed by posting notices and advertising in Harlan Daily Enterprise as directed” was a sufficient report that the sheriff had posted the notices required by this section, and in the absence of an allegation of fraud or mistake the report could not be collaterally attacked. Jackson v. Bolt, 292<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.503" target="_blank">Ky. 503</a></cite>, 166 S.W.2d 831, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS92" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 92</a></cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        If no report of the sheriff is filed, evidence may be heard as to whether notices were posted, but when report has been filed it is conclusive in absence of showing of fraud or mistake. Jackson v. Bolt, 292<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.503" target="_blank">Ky. 503</a></cite>, 166 S.W.2d 831, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS92" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 92</a></cite> (Ky. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provision of this section requiring a written report of the sheriff on posting of notices to be filed with the county court is directory and not mandatory. Steele v. Perry County, 299<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.827" target="_blank">Ky. 827</a></cite>, 187 S.W.2d 302, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS781" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defect in sheriff’s return, in stating that he had advertised that “election would be held at least five times in conspicuous places in each precinct,” instead of stating that the handbills were posted in five conspicuous places in each precinct, was cured by amended answer and sheriff’s testimony in contest suit, showing proper advertisement. Peel v. Boyle County, 301<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.655" target="_blank">Ky. 655</a></cite>, 191 S.W.2d 923, 1945<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS744" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of sheriff to report in writing to county courts that the notices of proposed election had been published and posted, which was an important process that should be observed, was not a mandatory provision after the election had been held, and issue as to whether notices were posted and published as required by law could be raised in a contest, though sheriff did not file his report, the difference being in the matter of the burden and weight of evidence.

        Where there was no allegation that sheriff failed to publish the required newspaper advertisements, sheriff’s return on back of printed notice certifying that the notice was printed and at least five were placed in each of the voting precincts, was sufficient compliance with this section and since there was no allegation of fraud or mistake truth of sheriff’s return could not be questioned collaterally under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.060" target="_blank">61.060</a></cite>.

        The form in which the question should or may be printed on the ballot is given in this section, but it is not necessary that it should be stated in the order calling the election. Cassady v.

        It is not necessary for the order calling the election to set forth the form of the question to be submitted to the voters. Keeling v.

        In order calling election it was unnecessary to state the question to be submitted to vote, and order stating that a “local option election” was directed to be held in a designated precinct was sufficiently clear and unambiguous.

        Since the Constitution does not prescribe the form in which the issue is to be stated on the ballot, it is sufficient when it conforms to the statute, since that form is sufficiently clear. Laswell v. Cooper, 266<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.524" target="_blank">Ky. 524</a></cite>, 99 S.W.2d 709, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS701" target="_blank">Ky.

        Question on ballot, “Are you in favor of adopting the local option law in Green County?” was proper where intoxicating liquor was sold in the county at the time of the election. Ennis v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Statement of question to be voted on in language prescribed by this section, on ballots and in order calling election, was proper although petition for election and order calling election were made prior to time Revised Statutes became effective, the only difference between this section and previous law being in the use of “prohibition” instead of “local option.” Keeling v. Coker, 294<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.199" target="_blank">Ky. 199</a></cite>, 171 S.W.2d 263, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS423" target="_blank">Ky.

        Provision in this section that in any election the form of the proposition “shall” be “Are you in favor of the sale of alcoholic beverages in (name of county or city)?”, is directory, and local option election is not invalid where question appearing upon the ballot was: “Are you in favor of adopting prohibition in Howard Voting Precinct, No. 50, which is in Bell County, Kentucky?”.

        This section is directory and not mandatory and a three day premature appointment of officers to conduct the election does not void the election. Kelly v. Gruelle, 298<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.450" target="_blank">Ky. 450</a></cite>, 183 S.W.2d 39, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS924" target="_blank">Ky.

        Since the provision of this section as to time of appointing election officers is directory and not mandatory the appointment of officers 19 days before election would not invalidate the election, in the absence of a showing of fraud or prejudice. Donohue v. Swindler, 299<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.119" target="_blank">Ky. 119</a></cite>, 184 S.W.2d 348, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS1031" target="_blank">Ky.

        Where county board of election commissioners made bona fide effort to appoint election officers within time prescribed by this section, but were unable to obtain persons willing to serve from list nominated by “wet” committee, and so were required to call for a new list, with result that officers were not appointed until five (5) days before election, the delay in appointing officers did not void the election in the absence of a showing of fraud or undue advantage in favor of successful side.

        Even if service of unqualified election officer constituted grounds for declaring a local option election void, the side which was responsible for the selection of the unqualified officer could not take advantage of the error. Bauer v. Wakefield, 299<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.42" target="_blank">Ky. 42</a></cite>, 184 S.W.2d 222, 1944<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS1017" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that one of election officers in a local option election was not qualified because he was not a resident of the precinct was not grounds for declaring the election void, where there was no evidence that his service had any effect on the result of the election and no fraud or prejudice was shown.

        In suit to restrain certification of returns or entry of order putting local option law into effect based on alleged insufficiency of steps preliminary to the election, court cannot inquire into latent defects in steps preliminary to the calling of the election.

        Where it is sought after a local option election to destroy the effect of petitions therefor, fair on their faces, through attacking the validity of the signatures thereon, the statutory method of contest is exclusive.

        Where some voters in a local option election were deprived of right of suffrage by reason that polls were not opened in four precincts, election would not be set aside where result would not have been changed even if all votes in such precincts had been cast for loser.

        Where, in local option election contest suit, six illegal voters testified they had voted in favor of prohibition, but before trial they executed written affidavits stating that they had voted against prohibition, and there was no evidence other than the affidavits to indicate that they had voted against prohibition, it was error to deduct their votes from the side opposed to prohibition.

        Order of circuit court, suspending operation of prohibition pending appeal from judgment in contest suit, was invalid insofar as it conditioned the suspension upon the appellants not pleading or relying upon the order of suspension in any prosecution brought against them for violating the local option law during the period of suspension.

        In an action to contest a local option election, in which the members of the county board of election commissioners were required to be made parties defendant, service of summons by the sheriff, on the two (2) appointive members of the board, constituted valid service as to them notwithstanding that sheriff was ex officio member of the board; and a written acceptance of service by the sheriff, on a summons directed to the coroner and delivered to the sheriff, constituted a valid entry of appearance by the sheriff, even though acceptance did not comply with requirements of statutes as to acknowledgment of service.

        Plaintiff’s conclusory allegation that the number of illegal subscriptions to petition calling for the election were sufficient to reduce the number of signers below 25 percent of the number of votes cast in the territory at the last preceding general election is insufficient to warrant injunction on ground that election was void, although the election might be voidable by proper contest. Neal v. Manning, 266<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.683" target="_blank">Ky. 683</a></cite>, 99 S.W.2d 766, 1936<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS722" target="_blank">Ky.

        In absence of pleading or proof that election was not properly advertised, or that attempt was made to exclude voters from election, the mere fact that polls were not opened in four precincts would not invalidate election.

        A general allegation that voters in certain precincts were prevented from casting their ballots, not setting forth the names of the voters involved, is not sufficient. Jackson v.

       <p>
        Where it is sought to have votes eliminated on the ground that they were illegal because they were cast openly in the presence of other persons, the names of the persons casting the illegal votes must be alleged. This is true even though the allegation is that all of the votes cast in the precinct were illegal. Jackson v. Bolt, 292<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.503" target="_blank">Ky. 503</a></cite>, 166 S.W.2d 831, 1942<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS92" target="_blank">Ky.

        The negligent omission or wilful failure of the board of election commissioners to answer within the prescribed time a petition contesting a local option election will not justify a default judgment. In such case the court may reasonably extend the time for answering, and if no answer is filed the court should treat the petition as controverted. Keeling v.

       When “dry” territory is annexed to “wet” territory, the annexed territory is not automatically “wet” and a local option election may be held in the precinct, including the annexed territory, and the outcome of this election will determine the “wet” or “dry” status of the entire precinct, as the way the majority of the voters in either the annexed territory or the original territory voted has no effect on the “wet” or “dry” status of the annexed territory.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG73-650" target="_blank">OAG 73-650</a></cite>.

       Every city of the first four classes that establishes home rule by compliance with subsection (1) of this section may only thereafter change its status by holding another separate, special local option election under subsection (1) of this section and, since it cannot hold such an election more often than once in every three (3) years, such city would not vote in a county-wide election where it had held an election establishing home rule within three (3) years; moreover, such city having independently determined its own local option status, the outcome of a county-wide election would not affect the city.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG76-624" target="_blank">OAG 76-624</a></cite>.

LEXIS 746</a></cite> (1950), case stands for the proposition that every city of the first four (4) classes may independently determine its own local option status and thus establish home rule and therefore, every city of the first four (4) classes in a dry county must separately and independently establish home rule under subsection (1) of this section and because one city has made an independent determination of its local option status and established home rule under the statute, this does not automatically establish home rule for any other such city similarly situated.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG76-624" target="_blank">OAG 76-624</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a city of the first four (4) classes has established home rule by conducting a local option election in which it votes in favor of prohibition, it will thereafter always independently determine its own local option status under subsection (1) of this section and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.200" target="_self">242.200</a></cite> and in the event prohibition is repealed in a local option election held in the county, the outcome of the county election will not affect the city.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG76-624" target="_blank">OAG 76-624</a></cite>.

       Where, subsequent to local option election in city in which city voted “wet,” territory was annexed to city, application for a malt beverage license should have been denied since the annexed territory encompassing the location of the business for which the malt beverage license was being sought remained “dry” after becoming annexed to the city and an election would have to be held in the entire precinct encompassing the annexed territory and therefore in the location of the business for which the malt beverage license was sought in order to redetermine the local option status of the annexed territory, including the business location in question.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG76-644" target="_blank">OAG 76-644</a></cite>.

       A city-wide election would convert “dry” annexed territory into “wet” territory if a city voted “wet.”<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG79-382" target="_blank">OAG 79-382</a></cite>.

       “Dry” territory annexed to the “wet” remains “dry” until some action is taken to change its status.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG79-382" target="_blank">OAG 79-382</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The annexation of the dry territory into the wet city precinct creates an enlarged precinct with both wet and dry areas, which is located within a “wet” city, and which may conduct a precinct election, and if the majority of voters are opposed to prohibition, convert the territory into an entirely “wet” precinct.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG79-382" target="_blank">OAG 79-382</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county has previously held a county-wide local option election at which it voted in favor of prohibition, a fourth-class city located within that county is a separate territorial unit under subsection (1) of this section for the purpose of determining its status on the issue of prohibition, and the city may proceed immediately with a city-wide local option election without waiting for three years as specified in subsection (5) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.030" target="_self">242.030</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG81-271" target="_blank">OAG 81-271</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a city previously held a local option election which resulted in the city being designated a “wet territory” despite the fact that two (2) precincts voted for prohibition and where a small portion of a “dry” county was then annexed to one (1) of the two (2) precincts which had voted for prohibition, the annexed territory assumed the “wet” status of the precinct pursuant to subsection (2) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.190" target="_self">242.190</a></cite>; however, a local option election could then be held to determine the “wet” or “dry” status of the precinct pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, despite the prior city-wide election.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG81-399" target="_blank">OAG 81-399</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since subsection (1) of this section authorizes a local option election in any city of the first four (4) classes in a dry county, but does not provide for separate voting by such cities when a county-wide election is called in a dry county, the votes for a fourth-class city could not be tabulated separately from the remaining county votes outside the corporate limits of the city.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG82-534" target="_blank">OAG 82-534</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county-wide local option election was held in a county that was dry prior to and remained dry after the election, even though a majority of the votes within a city were against prohibition, the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.220" target="_self">242.220</a></cite> to<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.430" target="_self">242.430</a></cite> were applicable to the city and such city could immediately proceed with a separate local option election pursuant to subsection (1) of this section to take the sense of the people as to discontinuance of prohibition within the city.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG82-534" target="_blank">OAG 82-534</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local option elections are within state “licensing and regulatory laws” for which an included city should be deemed to exist even after the adoption of an urban-county form of government. Therefore, the county unit rule would still apply to all of a county outside of that city, which would remain an independent unit for purposes of local option elections. The urban-county government charter may provide that future local option elections will not be bound by the “county unit” rule.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG88-40" target="_blank">OAG 88-40</a></cite>.

The petition may consist of one (1) or more separate units and shall be filed with the mayor of the city. In addition to the name of the voter, the petition shall also state the voter’s post office address and the correct date upon which the voter’s name is signed. Upon receipt of the petition, the mayor shall present it to the governing body of the city at its next regularly scheduled meeting and, after verifying that the petition is in compliance with the requirements of this section, the governing body shall by ordinance immediately designate the precinct to be a limited sale precinct.

       <p>
        Subdivision (10)(a) of this section is clearly premised on a finding by the governing body that the economy of a certain precinct has been adversely affected by the prohibition against the sale of alcoholic beverages; accordingly, the subdivision bears a reasonable relationship to the purpose of the act, which is to help the precinct’s economy, and is constitutional. United Dry Forces v. Lewis, 619 S.W.2d 489, 1981<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS260" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 260</a></cite> (Ky. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (10)(b) of this section bears no relationship to the statutory purpose of helping the precinct’s economy and is unconstitutional as special and local legislation, and elections held pursuant to that subdivision were void; however, because of the implied severability clause in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXXXXIc446s446.090" target="_blank">446.090</a></cite>, the remainder of this section is constitutional.

       <p>
        With the exception of subdivision (10)(b), this section is constitutional. United Dry Forces v. Citizens for Progressive Community, 635 S.W.2d 478, 1982<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS272" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 272</a></cite> (Ky. 1982).

        This section does not deal with government organizations or structure; accordingly, it does not fall within the exception provided by Ky.

         1. Suspension of Prohibition.
        </span>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Order of circuit court, suspending operation of prohibition pending appeal from judgment in contest suit, was invalid insofar as it conditioned the suspension upon the appellants not pleading or relying upon the order of suspension in any prosecution brought against them for violating the local option law during the period of suspension. Keeling v. Coker, 294<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.199" target="_blank">Ky. 199</a></cite>, 171 S.W.2d 263, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS423" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 423</a></cite> (Ky. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts have no power to postpone the date on which prohibition is to take effect but they may upon a showing of necessity for an injunction grant a temporary stay of enforcement of the prohibition law against the person seeking such a stay. Barger v. Ward, 407 S.W.2d 397, 1966<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS152" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 152</a></cite> (Ky. 1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Enforcement of prohibition is not automatically suspended by the filing of a suit to contest the election. Barger v. Ward, 407 S.W.2d 397, 1966<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS152" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 152</a></cite> (Ky. 1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a court has no inherent equity power with regard to election contest cases it does have equity powers where election contests involve property rights that are in need of protection. Barger v. Ward, 407 S.W.2d 397, 1966<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS152" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 152</a></cite> (Ky. 1966).

      <p>
       Where a city previously held a local option election which resulted in the city being designated a “wet territory” despite the fact that two precincts voted for prohibition and where a small portion of a “dry” county was then annexed to one of the two precincts which had voted for prohibition, the annexed territory assumed the “wet” status of the precinct pursuant to subsection (2) of this section; however, a local option election could then be held to determine the “wet” or “dry” status of the precinct pursuant to subsection (1) of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.125" target="_self">242.125</a></cite>, despite the prior city-wide election.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG81-399" target="_blank">OAG 81-399</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1980 amendment to this section, which added subsection (2), would obviously modify the holding in Rich-Hills Catering Co. v. Slattery, 448 S.W.2d 379, 1969<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS54" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 54</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1969), particularly in view of the conclusion reached therein to the effect that the legislature had provided no method of changing the status of a territory other than by an election as provided in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.200" target="_self">242.200</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG82-153" target="_blank">OAG 82-153</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where annexed territory is incorporated in and made a part of a “wet” precinct within a city, it will assume the status of the “wet” precinct.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG82-153" target="_blank">OAG 82-153</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where territory is annexed by a city and becomes part of a city precinct that has recently voted itself “dry,” the annexed property takes on the local option status of the precinct it is made a part of, in this case a dry precinct, notwithstanding the fact that the city’s local option status is “wet.”<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG83-171" target="_blank">OAG 83-171</a></cite>.

        To be guilty of illegally possessing intoxicating liquor within the meaning of the local option law such liquor must not only be kept for the purpose of sale but it must be subject to the control and management of the accused.

        Possession of liquor in dry territory constitutes an offense if (1) it is for sale, barter or loan, or (2) if the liquor was unlawfully acquired, or (3) if the liquor is intended to be used unlawfully.

        While possession of a large quantity of alcoholic beverages may give rise to an inference of intent to sell or other illicit purpose, mere possession of five cases of beer was not a “large quantity” so as to raise such an inference.

        In prosecution for possession of alcoholic beverages for purposes of sale under this section, introduction of search warrant and affidavit containing information regarding other offenses committed by the defendants over defendants’ objections was reversible error.

        Proof of possession by defendant of some 44 bottles of liquor and 35 cases of beer, particularly when combined with testimony as to defendant’s reputation in the community, presented sufficient evidence to support a finding that possession was for sale or some other illegal purpose.

        Conviction of person on charge of selling whiskey in dry territory was no bar to a prosecution of the same person for possessing liquor, where first prosecution was based on sale of two pints of whiskey and second prosecution was based on possession of several pints of gin, found on premises on search under search warrant made one hour after the sale of the whiskey. The fact that the gin was in possession at the time of the sale of the whiskey did not restrict the conduct to one offense, since continuing to retain possession of the gin after the sale of the whiskey constituted a separate offense.

        A record is the “best evidence” to prove that a county has adopted local laws, and in a prosecution for a violation of a local option law, the Commonwealth should prove that the local option law was in effect at the time of the commission of the offense charged. Minx v. Commonwealth, 283<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.14" target="_blank">Ky. 14</a></cite>, 140 S.W.2d 658, 1940<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS283" target="_blank">Ky.

       <p>
        Where Commonwealth offered no proof that local option law was in force in county, such failure of proof necessitated a reversal of judgment of conviction. Howard v.

       <p>
        Where defendant is prosecuted for the offense of selling alcoholic beverages in a dry territory it is incumbent upon the Commonwealth to prove local option was in effect in the county at the time of the occurrence of the offense, and failure to prove this fact is reversible error.

       </p>
       <p>
        Absent some special issue as to the existence of local option, the trial court will take judicial notice of the county’s status in this respect. Rogers v. Commonwealth, 424 S.W.2d 130, 1968<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS445" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 445</a></cite> (Ky. 1968).

        Where the appellant claimed the indictment was defective but failed to state how, he did not make a sufficient showing of error to entitle him to review. Baker v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment charging local option violation with two prior convictions need only state that the convictions followed one another. It is not necessary for it to state that the second offense was committed after the first conviction. House v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment setting out the details of a local option offense and alleging that this was defendant’s third offense of that type was sufficient as setting out the essential facts constituting the specific offense charged.

        Evidence which did not show that accused had possession of intoxicating liquor for any of the purposes prohibited by either KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.020" target="_self">243.020</a></cite> or KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.230" target="_self">242.230</a></cite>, was insufficient as matter of law to show violation of such sections.

        Where evidence showed defendant had purchased whiskey unlawfully, for personal consumption, and had in fact consumed most of it, there was no violation of this section, and the defendant was entitled to a peremptory instruction. Bray v. Commonwealth, 302<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.846" target="_blank">Ky. 846</a></cite>, 196 S.W.2d 725, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS768" target="_blank">Ky.

       <p>
        Conviction under this section reversed where only evidence was that defendant, while visiting prisoner in jail, was seen by deputy jailer standing close to bars with hand in bosom talking to inmate, and on being searched was found to be carrying a half-pint of whiskey. Sims v. Commonwealth, 308<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.281" target="_blank">Ky. 281</a></cite>, 214 S.W.2d 400, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS931" target="_blank">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where an amount of alcoholic beverages larger than normal for personal use was found in the trailer occupied by the defendant and he admitted purchasing the beverages and that they were his property and he had a reputation for violating the local option law, the proof was sufficient for the jury to find him guilty of a violation of the statute. Miller v. Commonwealth, 432 S.W.2d 638, 1968<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS347" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 347</a></cite> (Ky. 1968).

        Possession of 60 or more cases of beer in an automobile in local option territory raises an inference that it was not for personal or other legitimate use and constitutes circumstantial evidence of illicit purpose.

        Where the arresting officer claims he purchased nine cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and three cans of Drewry’s beer from the defendant, in addition to a half pint of whiskey, but at trial introduces 11 cans of Pabst and one can of Drewry’s, it is sufficient to convict the defendant of selling alcohol in dry territory under this section when the officer satisfactorily explained the extra cans of Pabst and the absence of two cans of Drewry's. Patton v. Commonwealth, 473 S.W.2d 144, 1971<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS153" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 153</a></cite> (Ky. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where search of defendant’s car revealed he had 17 cases of beer in the trunk of his car, the quantity was sufficient to support a conviction for offense of transporting alcoholic beverages for purpose of sale in local option territory.

        Where the only evidence that the liquid which was sold, if any, was alcohol was the testimony of the trooper who participated in the purchase and no chemical analysis of the liquid was made to determine if in fact it was an alcoholic beverage, nor was any testimony introduced that consuming that particular liquid in sufficient quantity would cause intoxication, the Commonwealth did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt. that the liquid was one prohibited under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242" target="_self">Chapter 242</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Where the officers seized 48 cans of beer, five pints of whiskey, and one pint of vodka, there was an apparent attempt to destroy the evidence, and the defendant had previously pleaded guilty to a similar offense, there was sufficient evidence to overcome a directed verdict and to give the case to the jury, and there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury’s verdict of conviction.

        Circuit clerk’s testimony concerning court record reflecting first conviction, showing entry of judgment of conviction on June 7, 1956, and indictment charging a liquor law violation assertedly committed on or about October 1, 1969, “second offense, former conviction: Clay Circuit Court Indictment #8109 June 7, 1956, fined $40.00 sentenced 30 days in jail” made clear that the alleged second violation of local option law occurred subsequently to the commission and conviction of the first alleged violation.

        Where the judgment book showed the dates of the two previous convictions without showing the dates of the commission of those offenses but there was three (3) years between the two convictions, there was abundant circumstantial evidence of the required progressive sequence.

        The evidence of defendant’s illegal possession of beer with proof of appellant’s bad reputation respecting violation of liquor laws was adequate to create a jury issue as to his proprietary connection with the beer and it was not necessary to establish appellant’s legal title to the premises on which beer was found.

        In prosecution for selling intoxicating liquors in dry territory giving of instruction that included the penalty for trafficking in alcoholic beverages without a license instead of the penalty for selling intoxicating liquors in dry territory was reversible error. Holt v. Commonwealth, 283<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.138" target="_blank">Ky. 138</a></cite>, 140 S.W.2d 1013, 1940<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS302" target="_blank">Ky.

       <p>
        Where jury was instructed it could fine or imprison the accused, instead of imposing a fine and imprisonment as provided in this section, if it found him guilty, and the jury returned with a fine only, the judge should not have permitted the entry of the verdict and granted a new trial. Chandler v. Commonwealth, 293 S.W.2d 717, 1956<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS86" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 86</a></cite> (Ky. 1956).

       <p>
        In prosecution of three defendants for possessing liquor for sale in dry territory where arresting officers testified that when they entered defendants were breaking bottles in the stove and sink and there was glass in the sink and stove, one defendant testified that he had only two bottles in the house belonging to him and that he threw them in the stove and his defense as to the other bottles was simply a general denial, two other defendants were not entitled to an instruction that on theory of defense that whiskey found on their premises belonged to other defendant. White v. Commonwealth, 310 S.W.2d 277, 1958<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS384" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 384</a></cite> (Ky. 1958).

        The defendant was not entitled to reversal of her conviction on grounds that she was entitled to an affirmative instruction on her defense that the room in which the alcoholic beverages were found and its contents were rented and in the possession of another and that she had no possession of them, where she failed to object to the instructions given and failed to raise the question in her motion and grounds for a new trial or at any time before her appeal. Jarrett v. Commonwealth, 434 S.W.2d 808, 1968<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS249" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 249</a></cite> (Ky. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instructions which failed to require a finding that the beer was possessed for sale and did not properly submit the sequence as to prior offense constituted reversible error. Duff v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no specific objection to the instructions, either during the trial or in the motion and grounds for new trial, directed to the specific point complained of on appeal, the issue was not preserved for review. Baker v. Commonwealth, 465 S.W.2d 305, 1971<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS464" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 464</a></cite> (Ky. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction which failed to require that each successive offense had been committed after conviction of the previous one in case involving local option violation with two previous convictions was erroneous.

       </p>
       <p>
        Technical objection to judge’s instructions not made at the time instructions were given and not presented on motion for new trial was not of sufficient magnitude to warrant reversal, as evidence clearly established that defendant had committed prior offenses and been convicted of them.

       It is not permissible to transport beer into dry territory in order to give it away or sell it to another person notwithstanding the lack of any profit.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG63-576" target="_blank">OAG 63-576</a></cite>.
      </p>

       If in dry territory, a county jailer could arrest anyone delivering liquor to an inmate of the jail without a warrant if the offense was committed in the jailer’s presence.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG65-183" target="_blank">OAG 65-183</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A beverage which contains less than one percent of alcohol by volume is not an “alcoholic beverage” as the term is defined by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.010ol11" target="_self">242.010(1)</a></cite> and its distribution in dry territory is not regulated by this section.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG68-334" target="_blank">OAG 68-334</a></cite>.

       An inferior court under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.40.html#tXXXXc439s439.550" target="_blank">439.550</a></cite> may probate the fine or the jail sentence or both for violations of the local option statute.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG70-694" target="_blank">OAG 70-694</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever any person has been found guilty of a crime, upon verdict or plea, in any court inferior to the Circuit Court, the jail sentence cannot be probated where KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.40.html#tXXXXc439s439.550" target="_blank">439.550</a></cite> has not been or cannot be complied with.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG70-694" target="_blank">OAG 70-694</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       Drinking of alcoholic beverages in a private place, whether wet or dry, is not disorderly conduct and is not a crime. This section only prohibits the possession of alcoholic beverages when the possession is for the purpose of sale or possession has been acquired unlawfully. However, if there is evidence that the possession is unlawful, that is, for the purpose of sale, such evidence would not support a charge of disorderly conduct.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG70-831" target="_blank">OAG 70-831</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not a violation of the local option law for persons belonging to a private club to have their own beverages, individually marked, stored at the club to be consumed when the members of the club so desire, provided that the club possesses no such beverages and that there is no sale of them.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG70-831" target="_blank">OAG 70-831</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of the local option law do not prohibit persons from bringing their own alcoholic beverages to a private dance. The local option law does not prohibit a person from possessing alcoholic beverages for his own personal consumption, nor does it prohibit him from consuming these beverages in a private place.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG70-831" target="_blank">OAG 70-831</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private club would not be permitted to sell malt beverages if it is located in dry territory.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG72-216" target="_blank">OAG 72-216</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since only the possession of liquor for the purpose of trafficking in liquor is prohibited, a member of a private club may bring his own liquor for his own personal consumption provided that he does not sell, barter, loan, give away, procure or furnish alcohol to another regardless of whether club members are required to sign an agreement not to violate the law.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG73-820" target="_blank">OAG 73-820</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An employee-member of a private club in charge of the club premises would not be in violation of this section by permitting the club members to drink their personally owned alcoholic beverages on the private club premises.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-313" target="_blank">OAG 74-313</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private club would not be in violation of this section in allowing its adult club members to bring their own alcoholic beverages into the club for their own personal consumption as the mere possession of legally produced, legally possessed and legally purchased alcoholic beverages by a person at least 21 years of age for his “own personal consumption” is not in violation of this section.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-313" target="_blank">OAG 74-313</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bartender of a private club cannot keep a member’s bottle with his name or club number on the bottle behind the bar and pour a drink for the member and for his guest in a set up sold by the club.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-574" target="_blank">OAG 74-574</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An adult member of a private club can legally procure and store his legally produced and legally possessed individual beer and whiskey in his owned, furnished or rented private individual locker on the club’s premises without being in violation of the alcoholic beverage control laws as the mere possession of the beverage for his own private consumption is not illegal, but the member cannot give a friend or a guest a drink from the member’s private bottle.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-574" target="_blank">OAG 74-574</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private club can cool a member’s private beer in its own regular cooler without private sections for each member provided the member’s name appears on the beverage container, thereby identifying the real owner.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-574" target="_blank">OAG 74-574</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private club can sell and charge for nonalcoholic set ups without violating the alcoholic beverage statutes.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-574" target="_blank">OAG 74-574</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private club member may bring in warm beer earlier and ask the bartender to cool the beer for later use that night but the member’s name must appear on the container.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-574" target="_blank">OAG 74-574</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private club member owning and keeping alcoholic beverages on the club premises should be prepared to prove that the alcoholic beverages were legally procured by him.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-574" target="_blank">OAG 74-574</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to avoid a law violation a private club must be prepared to prove that the name of each member keeping alcoholic beverages on the premises properly appears on each container.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-574" target="_blank">OAG 74-574</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two private club members may be assigned one locker and may keep their privately owned beverages in the joint locker providing the names of the owners appear on the containers.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG74-574" target="_blank">OAG 74-574</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private country club located in “dry” territory may not establish a bar and sell alcoholic beverages solely to its members.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG75-208" target="_blank">OAG 75-208</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there is no specific quantity of alcoholic beverages that serves as a line of demarcation between unlawful possession or transportation of such beverages for the purpose of sale and lawful possession or transportation, as covered by this section, and each case must rest on its own particular facts, evidence of transportation of a large quantity of alcoholic beverages in dry territory raises an inference that such beverage was not possessed for personal or other legitimate use and is sufficient to support a conviction of the offense of transporting such beverages for the purpose of sale.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG76-279" target="_blank">OAG 76-279</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any messenger or delivery service used to acquire alcoholic beverages to be transported into dry territory would be in direct violation of this section, regardless of whose money was used to purchase the beverages and regardless of ownership.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG79-389" target="_blank">OAG 79-389</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private club where each member purchases and stores his own bottle of liquor for his personal use on the premises is legal; mere possession of alcoholic beverages in dry territory is not a violation of the local option laws.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG79-389" target="_blank">OAG 79-389</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this section prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages in dry territory, a sheriff who has executed upon a large quantity of such goods under a general order of execution could not sell the beverages as other property.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG79-581" target="_blank">OAG 79-581</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A private club located in dry territory can make a club member’s whiskey available to him for his consumption in the club house.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG84-185" target="_blank">OAG 84-185</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere possession of alcoholic beverages in local option territory does not constitute an offense and it is not a criminal offense to transport alcoholic beverages by either public or private conveyance into dry territory for personal use.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG84-185" target="_blank">OAG 84-185</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drinking of alcoholic beverages in a private club, whether in a wet or dry county, is not a crime; this section only prohibits the possession of alcoholic beverages when that possession is for the purpose of sale in a dry territory or the possession has been unlawfully acquired.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG84-185" target="_blank">OAG 84-185</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, to be applicable, involves possession for the purpose of trafficking in liquor in dry territory; thus liquor lawfully acquired and lawfully used is outside of this prohibition.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG84-185" target="_blank">OAG 84-185</a></cite>.

        A proceeding under this section is special, preventive rather than punitive in its nature and effect, and if substantially followed will sustain an action for abatement. Commonwealth v.

        A forfeiture proceeding is, though civil in form, in the nature of a criminal proceeding. Barnes v.

        This section does not contemplate forfeiture of property not used for unlawful purposes condemned by it; only tracts of land where nuisance existed should be sold. Froedge v.

        Whatever the interest vested in the Commonwealth by this section to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.350" target="_self">242.350</a></cite>, it is not equal to or superior to that held by an innocent creditor whose interest in the property existed prior to the violation of this section. Bratcher v. Ashley, 243 S.W.2d 1011, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS1197" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 1197</a></cite> (Ky. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was not intended by itself alone to place the Commonwealth in a better position than, or give it a right superior to, an innocent creditor who unquestionably held an interest in the property prior to the arrest of the wrongdoer. Bratcher v. Ashley, 243 S.W.2d 1011, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS1197" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 1197</a></cite> (Ky. 1951).

        It was the intention of the Legislature to protect the interests of innocent parties in the property to be forfeited and sold. Bratcher v. Ashley, 243 S.W.2d 1011, 1951<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS1197" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 1197</a></cite> (Ky. 1951).

       <p>
        Evidence relating to a single illicit sale of liquor, with attendant circumstances, was sufficient to constitute a nuisance under this section. Beavin v. Commonwealth, 308<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.522" target="_blank">Ky. 522</a></cite>, 215 S.W.2d 119, 1948<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS985" target="_blank">Ky.

        To warrant a conviction for maintaining a liquor nuisance, the Commonwealth must prove the accused, by his ownership or control of the premises, was either maintaining the place or was connected with its maintenance in some way and knew its character. Adkins v. Commonwealth, 313<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.110" target="_blank">Ky. 110</a></cite>, 230 S.W.2d 453, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS819" target="_blank">Ky.

        In action under this section evidence must clearly establish existence of all conditions rendering property subject to forfeiture and one of these conditions is that owner of property must know or intend that the property is being or is to be used for the unlawful purpose charged. Chaney v. Commonwealth, 314<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.279" target="_blank">Ky. 279</a></cite>, 234 S.W.2d 960, 1950<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS1079" target="_blank">Ky.

        Allegation couched solely in the words of this section was not sufficient as it did not apprise the defendant of the particular acts on the basis of which a nuisance was claimed to exist and for which reason a forfeiture was sought.

        Where there was considerable testimony as to open and continuous manufacture, storage and sale of liquor at a private residence, the testimony of the woman who owned and resided in the residence that she had no knowledge that her husband was making or selling liquor there was not sufficient to avoid a forfeiture. Moore v. Commonwealth, 293<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.55" target="_blank">Ky. 55</a></cite>, 168 S.W.2d 342, 1943<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS558" target="_blank">Ky.

        This section is a drastic measure and before property may be forfeited under it, evidence must clearly establish the existence of all the requirements of the statute, one of which is that the owner of the property must know, or intend, the use to which the property is to be put is for the unlawful purpose charged.

        It was not necessary to make wife of defendant a party to action for forfeiture for she had only an inchoate right of dower in property and her right would not be affected by sale of her husband’s interest.

        Mere fact that the affiant was charged with failing to qualify as “reputable citizen” because he was only 17 years old, unlettered, and evinced some lack of average intellect was not sufficient showing on the record to quash search warrant on the basis that the warrant was issued on affidavit of one not a “reputable citizen.” Duff v.

       Since this section causes a contraband alcoholic beverage to lose its character as property a value judgment convicting defendant of offense under local option law does not result in any forfeiture which could constitute an additional penalty creating an excess above the maximum fine of $100 authorized by KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.990" target="_self">242.990</a></cite>, thus the quarterly court has jurisdiction to try such an offense under local option law when alcoholic beverages in the possession of defendant were seized at the time of the arrest.

        Conviction for third offense was improper because indictment was fatally defective in that, though charging that the second offense was committed and conviction had thereon prior to the commission of the third offense, it failed to charge that the second offense was committed subsequent to the commission of and conviction for the first offense.

        The indictment, the evidence, and the instructions should make it clear that the commission and conviction of the second crime were subsequent to the commission of the first and the commission of the third crime was after the commission and conviction of the second.

        Conviction of a third offense under this section may be had notwithstanding the second conviction was had in the quarterly court whose jurisdiction is limited to the imposition of a fine of not more than $100 and 60 days in jail. Defendant cannot complain that the additional penalty for the second offense was not imposed. Spears v.

        This section provides more severe penalties for successive convictions for violation of the local option law and a number of offenses as well as a number of prior convictions are properly chargeable in the indictment.

        Where the order book containing a 1952 judgment of conviction against the defendant was not signed until the trial for the 1970 violation, the judgment was sufficient for the enhanced penalty of subsection (1) of this section to be imposed.

       </p>
       <p>
        The increased punishment authorized by statute for a third violation is predicated upon the showing of the two (2) previous convictions and it is not material that the sentence imposed for the previous convictions was improper or that a jail sentence, if imposed thereon, was not served.

        While the burden is on the Commonwealth under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.230" target="_self">242.230</a></cite> to prove that the prior crimes and the one with which the defendant is now charged were committed successively after each conviction, where the second conviction recited in an indictment was itself an earlier conviction under the enhancement provision for a third offense, the determination of successiveness had already been made at a prior trial and proof that such trial resulted in conviction was sufficient to support enhancement of the penalty. Owsley v. Commonwealth, 556 S.W.2d 451, 1977<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.App.LEXIS818" target="_blank">Ky. App. LEXIS 818</a></cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).

      <p>
       The police court of a fifth-class city has jurisdiction in local option cases.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG63-754" target="_blank">OAG 63-754</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A judge of the police court of a fourth-class city can probate the jail sentence in a local option violation case so long as he follows the provisions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.40.html#tXXXXc439s439.550" target="_blank">439.550</a></cite>.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG66-84" target="_blank">OAG 66-84</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In local option violations where the quarterly court and justices of the peace have concurrent jurisdiction, the quarterly court should try the case if that was the court before which the defendant was first brought.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG67-39" target="_blank">OAG 67-39</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The justice court has no authority, where a second or third offense is involved, to reduce the charge to a first offense.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG70-623" target="_blank">OAG 70-623</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The justices’ courts only have jurisdiction of the first offense under this section.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG70-623" target="_blank">OAG 70-623</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides a mandatory jail sentence and a fine for natural persons pleading guilty to or who are convicted of a violation of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.230" target="_self">242.230</a></cite>, but the justice court may, under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.40.html#tXXXXc439s439.550" target="_blank">439.550</a></cite>, probate the jail sentence, provided that the requirements of the latter statute are met.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG70-623" target="_blank">OAG 70-623</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the quarterly court has no jurisdiction in “second offense” cases, the quarterly court has no jurisdiction or authority to pass on any preliminary motion in such a case.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG71-119" target="_blank">OAG 71-119</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The quarterly court has no jurisdiction of second offense cases involving violations of KRS ch. 242.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG71-119" target="_blank">OAG 71-119</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An inferior court may probate a defendant as a first or second offender under subsection (1) of this section by suspending judgment as to the fine and the jail sentence provided that all the stautory conditions of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.40.html#tXXXXc439s439.550" target="_blank">439.550</a></cite> are met.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG72-221" target="_blank">OAG 72-221</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section limits the jurisdiction of inferior courts to the first offenses arising under this chapter.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG72-677" target="_blank">OAG 72-677</a></cite> (modifying<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG72-221" target="_blank">OAG 72-221</a></cite>).

        The provisions of the alcoholic beverage control law forbidding the transportation of liquor by carriers other than licensed common carriers, and forbidding distillers to deliver to an unauthorized carrier, are not invalid under the commerce clause, or the due process and equal protection clauses, of the federal constitution, as applied to a contract motor carrier, licensed as such under federal law, desiring to transport liquor from Kentucky to other states in interstate commerce. Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves, 308 U.S. 132, 60 S. Ct. 163, 84 L. Ed. 128, 1939 U.S. LEXIS 96 (U.S. 1939).

        Where sole charge against truck operator was transportation of alcoholic beverages without a transporter’s license, in violation of this section, and there was no allegation in the record that the place where the offense occurred was in local option territory, the provisions of the local option law with reference to confiscation of property used in illegal liquor traffic could not be invoked, nor could jurisdiction of quarterly court to try the offense be determined by provisions of local option law.

       (7/15/2020). This statute was amended by

       (7/15/2016). A reference to “KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.895" target="_self">243.895</a></cite>” in this statute has been changed in codification to read “KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.890" target="_self">243.890</a></cite>.” In
    2016 Ky. Acts ch. 80, sec. 5, subsection (8)(b)2. refers to “tax collections imposed pursuant to
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.710" target="_self">243.710</a></cite> to
   <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.895" target="_self">243.895</a></cite>.” It is obvious from the context that the citation of this range should not include the final section,
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.895" target="_self">243.895</a></cite>, which is a statute on an unrelated topic. Under the authority of

       (6/25/2013). 2013 Ky. Acts ch. 121, sec. 50, made changes to subsection (3) of this statute. It is apparent from consultation with the drafter, examination of the bill folder, and from context that the second use of the phrase “sell and serve malt beverages” should have been deleted from subsection (3), now subsection (5). The Reviser of Statutes has deleted the phrase “may sell and serve malt beverages” under the authority of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136" target="_blank">7.136</a></cite>.

        Since this section authorizes a city legislative body to impose license fees for the privilege of selling alcoholic beverages by the drink at retail, and since KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc244s244.290" target="_self">244.290</a></cite> authorizes the city to establish the hours of sale, there is no violation of the statutes by reason of the fact that a city issues two types of licenses to carry on the same retail drink business at different operating hours.

        The fact that alcoholic beverage control board, after finding wholesaler guilty of violating O.P.A. ceilings in sale of whiskey, merely suspended his license for 25 days instead of revoking the license, did not bar the board, on ground of res adjudicata or double punishment, from refusing subsequent application of wholesaler for renewal of his license for the following year, particularly where there was evidence that suspension was given at request of federal officials prosecuting licensee and confederates in federal court, and the proceedings in the federal court subsequently developed the serious extent of the licensees’ violations.

        Allowing in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers in certain circumstances while prohibiting out-of-state wineries from doing the same has no differential effect on the shipment of wine into dry territories; the statutory scheme under former KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc241s241.010ol122" target="_self">241.010(22)</a></cite> and (45), KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.155ol12" target="_self">243.155(2)</a></cite> and KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.156" target="_self">243.156</a></cite> (repealed effective January 1, 2007) discriminates based upon where the wine originates, not upon where it ends up; therefore, the in-state eligibility requirements are not narrowly tailored towards achieving temperance in dry territories.

       A transporter’s license may be issued as a primary license to a motor carrier authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth by the Transportation Cabinet or the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or to another person engaged in business as a common carrier. A person holding a transporter’s license may transport alcoholic beverages to or from the licensed premises of any licensee under this chapter to an individual consumer if both the consignor and consignee in each case are authorized by the law of the states of their residence to sell, purchase, deliver, ship, or receive the alcoholic beverages.

When the shipper requests adult-signature-only service, it shall be a violation for a common carrier not to inspect government-issued identification for proof of age.

        In determining on which street premises are located, and distance contemplated in prohibiting granting of license within 200 feet of church, school or hospital, the controlling factor is not the entrance to either building nor how they face, but the land on which the buildings are located, and the distance must be measured in a straight line from and to nearest points of respective properties.

        The fact that residents of dry counties may have to purchase liquor at anticompetitive prices does not overcome the regulatory interests of the Commonwealth under the Twenty-First Amendment.

        The determination of whether “substantial aggregations of population would otherwise not have reasonable access to a licensed vendor” is a matter of factfinding and not one of the exercise of discretionary power. Angel v. Palmer-Ball, 461 S.W.2d 105, 1970<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS613" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 613</a></cite> (Ky. 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The alcoholic beverage control board was without authority to issue a license to sell distilled spirits and wine by the package under this provision of the statute without first making a specific finding of fact that substantial aggregations of populations would not have reasonable access to a licensed vendor if such license was not issued, and a general finding of ultimate fact that “the premises * * * meet all of the requirements of the laws and regulations * * * for a * * * license” was not sufficient to authorize the issuance of the license. Pearl v. Marshall, 491 S.W.2d 837, 1973<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS608" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 608</a></cite> (Ky. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the board merely recited “substantial aggregations of population would otherwise not have reasonable access to a license vendor unless the license sought by the applicant here is issued,” the Circuit Court was correct in holding that just recitation of an ultimate fact was insufficient to withstand judicial review. Simms v. Angel, 513 S.W.2d 176, 1974<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS370" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 370</a></cite> (Ky. 1974).

        Where one of the applicants for a license was barred by res judicata and the other was not, the license could not be granted to the unbarred applicant alone, for that was not how the application was filed. Angel v. Palmer-Ball, 461 S.W.2d 105, 1970<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS613" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 613</a></cite> (Ky. 1970).

       <p>
        Where one of the applicants had previously applied with another individual for a license for the same location and was denied, he was barred by the doctrine of res judicata on a second application.

        A denial of an application five years earlier due to inadequate police protection and the existence of an adequate number of licensed vendors to serve the area was not res judicata as to another application by the same applicants where there was sufficient proof of changed conditions.

       <p>
        The words “aggregations of population” of subsection (3) (now subsection (6)(a)) of this section connote a relatively fixed and stable body of people in the immediate vicinity of the rural premises involved and do not include casual transients nor the residents of an adjacent dry territory. Simms v. Angel, 513 S.W.2d 176, 1974<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS370" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 370</a></cite> (Ky. 1974).

        The words, “aggregations of population,” as used in subsection (3) (now subsection (6)(a)) of this section do not include the residents of adjacent dry territory. Simms v. Angel, 513 S.W.2d 176, 1974<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS370" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 370</a></cite> (Ky. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the present holder of a valid retail package liquor license issued for premises situated in the rural or nonincorporated area of a county applies “to transfer” the license to another rural location in the same county and within the same general geographic area, it is within the discretionary power of the alcoholic beverage control board to approve and authorize such “transfer” if the applicant for the new license has previously shown that substantial aggregations of population would not otherwise have reasonable access to a licensed vendor. Hagan v. Knippenberg, 549 S.W.2d 509, 1976<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS151" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 151</a></cite> (Ky. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is only where there is a distinction between the area being served and the area to be served that a finding that substantial aggregations of population would not otherwise have reasonable access to a vendor would be required. Hagan v. Knippenberg, 549 S.W.2d 509, 1976<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS151" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 151</a></cite> (Ky. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record is devoid of any evidence showing that substantial aggregations of population would not have reasonable access to a vendor if application to transfer is denied, the granting of a retail package liquor license for premises not located within a city was an abuse of discretion. Higdon v. Knippenberg, 549 S.W.2d 513, 1976<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS152" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 152</a></cite> (Ky. 1976).

       Subsection (4) of this section, added by the 1984 amendment, should not be interpreted as a grandfather clause which, in effect, exempts from the $5,000 inventory provision those retail malt beverage licensees selling gasoline and lubricating oil, whose licenses are renewed prior to the effective date of the amendment (July 13, 1984).<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG84-272" target="_blank">OAG 84-272</a></cite>.

       The phrase “This section,” in subsection (4) of this section, must be interpreted to refer to the 1984 amendment of the statute, which added subsections (3), (4) and (5), and not the entire statute. The legislative intent of this statute is clear from subsection (2); any other construction of the term “section” in subsection (4) would essentially render subsection (2) meaningless.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG84-272" target="_blank">OAG 84-272</a></cite>.

        Where notice described location as “12 miles from Lebanon on the north side of Kentucky highway 208 in Marion County, Kentucky” and evidence showed general knowledge in the community that application had been made, notice was sufficient.

        Where an applicant for a malt beverage distributor’s license describes his premises in his notice of application by referring to the number of miles from a named city on the south side of a named highway, the applicant has fulfilled the requirement of subsection (1) of this section.

        Where voters in county local option election voted to legalize sale of alcoholic beverages and the county was allotted quota of retail package liquor licenses which quota was filled, nonsuccessful applicants who were admittedly qualified and to whose application no protest was made had standing to appeal administrator’s refusal to grant them licenses; however, trial court’s error in finding that there was no appeal from such refusal was harmless since the quota of licenses had been filled and the appeal would thus be an exercise in futility.

       <p>
        Authority of the alcoholic beverage control board to refuse to renew a distiller’s license must be based upon sound discretion rather than upon some arbitrary whim. Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Pebbleford Distillers, Inc., 302<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.96" target="_blank">Ky. 96</a></cite>, 193 S.W.2d 1019, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS602" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 602</a></cite> (Ky. 1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither the administrator nor the board may arbitrarily reject an application. Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Woosley, 367 S.W.2d 127, 1963<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS12" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 12</a></cite> (Ky. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature has, under this section, expressed a clear intent to leave to the reasonable judgment of the state administrator not only the determination of the propriety of granting a particular license but the determination of what material facts are important in reaching this decision. Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Woosley, 367 S.W.2d 127, 1963<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS12" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 12</a></cite> (Ky. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, the board has discretion on whether to grant or refuse a license, and only for abuse of that discretion will the board’s decision be reversed. Angel v. Moberly, 425 S.W.2d 538, 1968<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS416" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 416</a></cite> (Ky. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although subsection (2) of this section grants a state administrator the right to refuse a license for any reason which he, in the exercise of his sound discretion, may deem sufficient, his denial must be based upon the exercise of a sound discretion and it must be for a cause reasonably related to the propriety of granting the license. Bickett v. Palmer-Ball, 470 S.W.2d 341, 1971<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS276" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 276</a></cite> (Ky. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence before the board was primarily speculation and hearsay and where there was no evidence before the board affording any reasonable ground upon which the board might have refused to grant the license, the board’s refusal was an abuse of discretion. S. W. Palmer--Ball v. Esquire Liquors, Inc., 490 S.W.2d 472, 1973<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS626" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 626</a></cite> (Ky. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence did nothing but state an ultimate conclusion that the area was being adequately served by the present retail outlets and no reasons were given other than the familiarity of the witnesses with the location of other liquor outlets in the area, such evidence did not show any reasonable grounds upon which the board might have refused to issue the licenses and such refusal was an abuse of discretion. Dolan v. Shoppers Village Liquors, Inc., 492 S.W.2d 201, 1973<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS510" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 510</a></cite> (Ky. 1973).

       <p>
        The alcoholic control board was acting within its sound discretion in refusing to renew a distiller’s license because a 50% stockholder therein was convicted in federal court for violating O.P.A. regulations respecting whiskey sales in his own brokerage business, even though such conviction was not final. Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Pebbleford Distillers, Inc., 302<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.96" target="_blank">Ky. 96</a></cite>, 193 S.W.2d 1019, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS602" target="_blank">Ky.

       <p>
        An applicant for a malt beverage distributor’s license cannot be refused a license under subdivision (1)(b) of this section for having violated rules and regulations of the alcoholic beverage control board where the evidence during the board hearing was far from convincing and no finding was made that the applicant had violated any of the rules and regulations of the board. Bickett v. Palmer-Ball, 470 S.W.2d 341, 1971<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS276" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 276</a></cite> (Ky. 1971).

        Where the premises on which the applicant for a liquor license intended to locate his business was in an area zoned residential but there was testimony that the premises had been utilized for commercial purposes before the date of the zoning regulation, there was no error in a finding that the premises were commercial.

        The fact that alcoholic beverage control board, after finding wholesaler guilty of violating O.P.A. ceilings in sale of whiskey, merely suspended his license for 25 days instead of revoking his license, did not bar the board, on ground of res adjudicata or double punishment, from refusing subsequent application of wholesaler for renewal of his license for the following year, particularly where there was evidence that suspension was given at request of federal officials prosecuting licensee and confederates in federal court, and the proceedings in the federal court subsequently developed the serious extent of the licensee’s violations.

       The law prohibits an arbitrary selection or rejection of applicants for licenses and requires the exercise of sound discretion in such action and, since a lottery system is an arbitrary method of rejecting or selecting an application and involves no discretion, this method is not permitted under the law.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG83-306" target="_blank">OAG 83-306</a></cite>.

       This section allows the refusal of a license only after the administrator has exercised his or her discretion by considering certain substantive factors, several of which are listed and the section does not provide the administrator with the authority to reject applicants for licenses by any other means; therefore, the administrator does not possess the statutory authority to accept or reject certain applicants by use of a lottery system.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG83-306" target="_blank">OAG 83-306</a></cite>.

        Authority of the alcoholic beverage control board to refuse to renew a distiller’s license must be based upon sound discretion rather than upon some arbitrary whim. Alcoholic Beverage Control Board v. Pebbleford Distillers, Inc., 302<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.96" target="_blank">Ky. 96</a></cite>, 193 S.W.2d 1019, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS602" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 602</a></cite> (Ky. 1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        The board clearly has discretion under the statute and is not mandatorily required to suspend or revoke a license for the violation of its terms. Brown v. Carey, 442 S.W.2d 566, 1969<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS270" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 270</a></cite> (Ky. 1969).

       (6/29/2017). This statute was amended by 2017 Ky. Acts chs. 61 and 62. Where these Acts are not in conflict, they have been codified together. Where a conflict exists, Acts ch. 62, which was last enacted by the General Assembly, prevails under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXXXXIc446s446.250" target="_blank">446.250</a></cite>.

       Although references to the sale of “shares” were deleted in the Senate committee substitute, due to a clerical error, such reference was not deleted in subsection (7) of this section. The Reviser of Statutes, pursuant to KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.02.html#tIIc07s7.136" target="_blank">7.136</a></cite>, has removed the words “or shares” to conform.

        Where a handbook was found in a garage, and the garage and the tavern were but 15 feet apart but there was no entrance connecting them, nor was it shown that the person operating the handbook had any interest in the operation of the tavern nor the person operating the tavern had any interest in the handbook, there was no substantial evidence to establish gambling on premises licensed for the retail sale of beer and liquor which would justify the revocation of tavern operator’s license.

        Testimony of field agents that they bought whiskey at establishment, and owner’s admission that he had federal permit but not corresponding state and local licenses, was sufficient to establish guilt of trafficking in whiskey, and authorize revocation of beer license.

      Within three (3) days after any order of revocation of a license becomes final, notice of revocation shall be given to the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises. A notice mailed to the licensee and to the owner of the licensed premises at the address shown in the last application for a license or in the last statement supplemental to the application shall be deemed sufficient compliance with this section. The licensee shall at once surrender its license to the department.If the license revoked is for premises located in any city that has a police force of its own, the department, immediately upon mailing notice of the revocation of the license to the licensee, shall mail to the chief of the police department of that city a written notice stating the fact of the revocation, the name of the licensee whose license was revoked, the address of the premises that had been licensed under the revoked license, and the date of the revocation. If the license revoked is for premises that are not located in any city with a police force of its own, the department shall in like manner and at like time mail a similar notice to the sheriff of the county in which the premises are located. If the revoked license is not surrendered at once by the licensee, the chief of the police department or sheriff shall, at the request of the department, immediately cause one of its officers to take physical possession of the license and return it to the department.

        Where voters in county local option election voted to legalize sale of alcoholic beverages and the county was allotted quota of retail package liquor licenses which quota was filled, nonsuccessful applicants who were admittedly qualified and to whose application no protest was made had standing to appeal administrator’s refusal to grant them licenses; however, trial court’s error in finding that there was no appeal from such refusal was harmless since the quota of licenses had been filled and the appeal would thus be an exercise in futility.

        Legislature did not contemplate administrative punishment of unlicensed parties because it failed to provide non-licensees with any appellate remedy of a decision by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board; nowhere in KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.560" target="_self">243.560</a></cite>, nor any other statute in KRS Chs. 241 to 244, is appellate review of the Board’s decision mentioned in the context of a non-licensee who has been aggrieved by the imposition of administrative fines.

        As the Kentucky Alcoholic Beverage Control Board is not an administrative department separate from the Kentucky Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), the designation of the ABC as a party to an appeal to the circuit court is sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.560ol13" target="_self">243.560(3)</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature never intended an appeal under this section by an aggrieved citizen, who is not an applicant, from an order of the board granting the application for a liquor license; the citizen is heard by filing a “protest” under the provision of KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.360" target="_self">243.360</a></cite> on the granting of a license.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where voters in county local option election voted to legalize sales of alcoholic beverages and the county was allotted 21 retail package liquor licenses, nonapplicant aggrieved citizens could allege no violation of any property rights and thus they had no standing to complain against actions of administrator and board in granting the licenses.

        Under KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc241s241.200" target="_self">241.200</a></cite>, a liquor store owner was an aggrieved citizen entitled to an administrative hearing on an applicant’s request for liquor license; therefore, the trial court properly remanded the case to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the city administrator’s issuance of the license violated KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.450" target="_self">243.450</a></cite> because the applicant’s premises did not comply with the city’s regulations.

        An appeal to the circuit court by “citizen feeling himself aggrieved” by an order of the board granting a license does not afford any right to relief from such order on the ground that public interest considerations would have justified a refusal of the license by the administrator.

        Where application for city and county license had been refused by city council and county alcoholic beverage administrator, applicant who did not appeal to state board, could not maintain an action in local circuit court to compel issuance of licenses and to restrain prosecution against him, since appeal to state board and hence to Franklin County Circuit Court is sole remedy.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The term “party” as used in this section clearly means a party of record in the proceedings. Bartholomew v. Paniello, 287 S.W.2d 616, 1956<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS476" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 476</a></cite> (Ky. 1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only a “party” may appeal to the Court of Appeals from the circuit court under this section. Kelly v. Marino, 358 S.W.2d 519, 1962<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS188" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 188</a></cite> (Ky. 1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Kentucky state racing commission is charged with the duty of protecting substantial public interest and is therefore a representative of this interest in all proceedings, it was a “party aggrieved” within the purview of this section and can maintain the appeal. Kentucky State Racing Com. v. Fuller, 481 S.W.2d 298, 1972<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS250" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 250</a></cite> (Ky. 1972).

       (11/5/90). The text of this section originated in Senate Committee Substitute No. 2 for 1982 House Bill 571,
    see
    1982 Senate Journal 2026. In this substitute, Section 4 had two subsections. Floor Amendment No. 4 to this substitute deleted subsection (1) of Section 4 and removed (2) from the remainder of the text.
    See
    1982 Senate Journal 2207-08. The Senate adopted these two items in its treatment of House Bill 571,
    see
    1982 Senate Journal 2212, and the Free Conference Committee Report on House Bill 571 subsequently also incorporated this language,
    see
    1982 Senate Journal 2415, 1982 House Journal 3258-3259. It was in this form that House Bill 571 passed both Houses.
    See
    1982 Senate Journal 2425, 1982 House Journal 3259. For this reason, the words “subsection (2) of” that appeared before
    KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc243s243.884" target="_self">243.884</a></cite> were retained in this section by a manifest clerical error in failing to make the necessary comforming amendment. These words have been deleted by the Reviser of Statutes pursuant to

        Where complaint in action for wrongful death alleged that vendor knew when he sold the liquor to the intoxicated person that such person intended to drink all of it without ceasing and that the vendee could not be safely trusted with it, the vendor could reasonably foresee what might result, and the defense of contributory negligence was not available because the act of the vendor was alleged to be intentionally wrongful. Nally v. Blandford, 291 S.W.2d 832, 1956<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS405" target="_blank">Ky. LEXIS 405</a></cite> (Ky. 1956).

        Where the complaint seeking damages resulting from an automobile accident alleged a malicious sale of intoxicating beverages to minors whose ages and whose physical condition and the degree of intoxication, if any, were not stated and the conditions under which the sale was made were not revealed, the complaint, for procedural purposes, stated a sufficient claim upon which relief could be granted.

        Since the crime of selling to a minor is a malum prohibitum offense and intent and knowledge are neither elements, in absence of expressed legislative requirement, it is no defense that the vendor in good faith believed the infant purchaser was an adult.

      <p>
       The statute forbids a licensee to “procure or permit” a third party on the licensed premises to sell, give or deliver alcoholic beverages to a minor, regardless of where the beverages were obtained.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG64-281" target="_blank">OAG 64-281</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A licensee permits alcoholic beverages “to be sold, given away or delivered” when he has actual knowledge that such is being or will be done or when the circumstances are such that as a reasonably prudent man he should have had such knowledge.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG64-281" target="_blank">OAG 64-281</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       That portion of a city ordinance which imposed a lesser punishment for the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors than the state statute on the same subject was unconstitutional.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG67-273" target="_blank">OAG 67-273</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislative intent of this section is obviously to prohibit retail licensees as well as their employees working under their direct supervision and control from selling alcoholic beverages to minors; the statute is sufficiently broad to include the employees acting in their scope of employment as well as the retail licensees themselves.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-51" target="_blank">OAG 91-51</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section appears to be directed more toward retail businesses, while KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tXXXXXc530s530.070" target="_blank">530.070</a></cite> appears to be directed toward private persons acting in their private capacities.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-51" target="_blank">OAG 91-51</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section prohibits a person acting as an employee of a retail licensee from selling alcoholic beverages to a person under twenty-one years of age.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-51" target="_blank">OAG 91-51</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employee of a retail licensee sells alcoholic beverages to a minor the retail licensee is held to a strict liability standard for the direct illegal acts of his employee. Although the offense might be directly committed by the employee, the retail business is held accountable. For this reason, both the retail licensee and the employee should each be charged with the same offense.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG91-51" target="_blank">OAG 91-51</a></cite>.

       A brewery cannot pursuant to 804 KAR 1:080 (1) place any advertisements in a college student directory published by a noneducational, private business concern and therefore the placing of advertisements by such an alcoholic beverage licensee in a college student directory would not come within the exception to the prohibition against advertising contained in subsection (2) of this section.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG76-625" target="_blank">OAG 76-625</a></cite>.

        Former KRS<cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXc242s242.390" target="_self">242.390</a></cite> (now repealed), authorizing admission of evidence as to defendant’s reputation for engaging in illegal traffic in liquor, applies only to prosecutions under the local option law, and there is no similar statute governing prosecutions under the alcoholic beverage control law. Therefore, in prosecution for illegal possession of a still, under this section, it was prejudicial error to admit evidence as to defendant’s general reputation for selling liquor. Stephens v. Commonwealth, 303<cite class="ky_code"><a href="#Ky.108" target="_blank">Ky. 108</a></cite>, 196 S.W.2d 968, 1946<cite class="ky_app_code"><a href="#Ky.LEXIS792" target="_blank">Ky.

        In a prosecution under this section, where the only evidence of guilt of defendants was that they were found in the vicinity of the still with a sack of jars or jugs, and another person admitted he was the sole owner of the still, the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction, since the evidence at most indicated that defendants were prospective customers of the still owner.

       The legality of a retailer’s proposal to sell alcoholic beverages on a “lay-away” plan depends upon whether the terms of the “lay-away” plan at the outset involve a contract to sell rather than a present sale, with title passing on payment and delivery. If the transaction represents a contract to sell on the part of the retailer or an option to purchase on the part of the customer-purchaser, title has not passed and no binding sale for credit has occurred; on the other hand, if the lay-away plan involves a present sale with only payment and delivery postponed, the retailer-seller would clearly have completed a sale and passed title without receiving full remuneration thereby violating this section.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG83-416" target="_blank">OAG 83-416</a></cite>.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Whether the vertical restraint created by this section violates the antitrust laws would depend on whether the restraint poses a significant injury to competition and the anti-competitive conduct clearly overrides any procompetitive redeeming benefit.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG82-514" target="_blank">OAG 82-514</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In enacting this section, the 1982 General Assembly clearly articulated its policy to supplant the free and open market determination of distributor arrangements by requiring a written agreement between the distributor and brewer or supplier which defines the distributor’s exclusive territory; however, the section fails to provide for adequate state supervision over this policy since the determination of the exclusive territories is accomplished by private parties rather than by the state and the state does not regulate or “police” the enforcement of these exclusive territorial arrangements entered into by private parties. Thus, even though the exclusive territories for distributors are required by this section, the arrangements are not immune from antitrust scrutiny under the state action doctrine; whether the conduct contemplated by the section violates the antitrust laws would depend upon the factual circumstances surrounding the particular arrangement and the existence of an illegal restraint of trade.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG82-514" target="_blank">OAG 82-514</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section represents a vertical restraint between the brewer or supplier and the distributor by confining the distributor to a particular area of operation (plus various other restrictions relating to sale and quality control); these vertical nonprice restraints contained the potential to promote interbrand competition by allowing the manufacturer to achieve certain efficiencies in the distribution of his products and, moreover, society’s increasing demand that manufacturers directly assume responsibility for the safety and quality of their products constitutes a legitimate reason or justification for manufacturer control over the manner in which his product is sold. Accordingly, there is a rational relationship, for equal protection purposes, between the classification and the objectives justifying it; the statute also withstands a due process analysis in that it bears a reasonable relationship to the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG82-514" target="_blank">OAG 82-514</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to effectuate the intent of this section and to construe subsection (3) of this section in harmony with the other subsections, the phrase “brewer and supplier” in the last sentence of subsection (3) must be interpreted as “brewer or supplier” and thus subsection (3) must be interpreted to require the prior written approval of the supplier or brewer for the sale of a particular brand of malt beverage.<cite class="OAG"><a href="#OAG82-572" target="_blank">OAG 82-572</a></cite>.
