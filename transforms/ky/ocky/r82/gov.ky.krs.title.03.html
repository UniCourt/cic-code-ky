     <p>
      Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

        The purpose and function of the Kentucky Code of Legislative Ethics and the Executive Branch Code of Ethics is not to restrict or prohibit appropriate and protected communications of the lobbyists; instead, the Commonwealth’s compelling interest in insuring the proper operation of a democratic government and deterring corruption is protected by these narrowly tailored sections, which require only that one who receives compensation and/or expends funds in lobbying must register and report the nature and extent of his activities.

       It is the public policy of this Commonwealth that a public servant shall work for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth. The principles of ethical behavior contained in this chapter recognize that public office is a public trust and that the proper operation of democratic government requires that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="tIIIc11As11A.005ol11a">
         A public servant be independent and impartial;
        </li>
        <li id="tIIIc11As11A.005ol11b">
         Government policy and decisions be made through the established processes of government;
        </li>
        <li id="tIIIc11As11A.005ol11c">
         A public servant not use public office to obtain private benefits; and
        </li>
        <li id="tIIIc11As11A.005ol11d">
         The public has confidence in the integrity of its government and public servants.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="tIIIc11As11A.005ol12">
       The principles of ethical behavior for public servants shall recognize that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="tIIIc11As11A.005ol12a">
         Those who hold positions of public trust, and members of their families, also have certain business and financial interests;
        </li>
        <li id="tIIIc11As11A.005ol12b">
         Those in government service are often involved in policy decisions that pose a potential conflict with some personal financial interest; and
        </li>
        <li id="tIIIc11As11A.005ol12c">
         Standards of ethical conduct for the executive branch of state government are needed to determine those conflicts of interest which are substantial and material or which, by the nature of the conflict of interest, tend to bring public servants into disrepute.

      (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky. Acts ch. 107), did not comply with the three-readings rule of Kentucky Constitution Section 46 and that the legislation is, therefore, constitutionally invalid and declared void. That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.

Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

      (12/1/2000). The contingency on the effectiveness of this statute set by
    2000 Ky. Acts ch. 417, sec. 18, was met, the voters of the Commonwealth having ratified at the general election on November 7, 2000, a constitutional amendment (see
      2000 Ky. Acts ch. 399) abolishing the Railroad Commission.
     </p>
     
     <p>
      (7/15/98). A reference to “KRS 11A.010(9)(a) to (i)” in the former subsection (6) of this statute (now subsection (7)) has been changed in codification to “KRS 11A.010(9)(a) to (h)” under KRS 7.136(1)(e) and (h). 1998 Ky. Acts ch. 429, sec. 1, eliminated the former paragraph (g) of KRS 11A.010(9) and renumbered the remaining subsections accordingly. Other actions within Acts Chapter 429 used the “(a) to (h)” range in new language and modified existing language to use the “(a) to (h)” range. It seems clear from context, and this has been confirmed by the drafter of the bill, that this change was intended here as well but was inadvertently overlooked.

     <p>
      (12/1/2000). The contingency on the effectiveness of this statute set by
    2000 Ky. Acts ch. 417, sec. 18, was met, the voters of the Commonwealth having ratified at the general election on November 7, 2000, a constitutional amendment (see
      2000 Ky. Acts ch. 399) abolishing the Railroad Commission.
     </p>
     
     <p>
      (7/15/98). A reference to “KRS 11A.010(9)(a) to (i)” in subsection (1) of this statute has been changed in codification to “KRS 11A.010(9)(a) to (h)” under KRS 7.136(1)(e) and (h). 1998 Ky. Acts ch. 429, sec. 1, eliminated the former paragraph (g) of KRS 11A.010(9) and renumbered the remaining subsections accordingly. Other actions within Acts Chapter 429, including in the section that amended this statute, used the “(a) to (h)” range in new language and modified existing language to use the “(a) to (h)” range. It seems clear from context, and this has been confirmed by the drafter of the bill, that this change was intended here as well but was inadvertently overlooked.

        A finding of no probable cause is not a “final determination” such as one reached at the conclusion of a full-blown adjudicatory hearing conducted under KRS 11A.100(3). It is, instead, an option available to the Commission if, in the course of a preliminary investigation, it determines that the complaint does not allege facts sufficient to constitute a violation of KRS Chapter 11A. Records pertaining to such preliminary investigative findings, including minutes of executive sessions of the Commission, are expressly excluded from public inspection by operation of KRS 11A.080(2).

       Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

      Since interjection of “legislative agent” in the middle of subsection (6) of this section, a statute dealing with executive agency lobbysists, is a palpable mistake, subsection (6) of this section must be read to say “executive agency lobbyist” instead of “legislative agent” and “executive lobbyist” in this section should be read as “executive agency lobbyist.”

       (6/29/2021). This statute was amended by 2021 Ky. Acts chs. 12, 24, 26, 82, 99, 156, 185, and 186, which do not appear to be in conflict and have been codified together.

      <p>
       (7/15/2014). Under the authority of
    KRS 7.136(1), the Reviser of Statutes has modified the internal numbering system in Units I., II., and III. of this statute to conform to the format used in the Kentucky Revised Statutes. The words in the text and the placement of the entities were not changed.

       (12/1/2000). The contingency on the effectiveness of this statute set by

      (7/12/2012). 2012 Ky. Acts ch. 158, sec. 84, instructs the Reviser of Statutes to correct statutory references to agencies and officers affected by the Act, as it confirms the reorganization of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services within the executive branch, including the transfer of the Governor’s Council on Wellness and Physical Activity from the Office of the Governor to the Department for Public Health. Such a correction has been made in this statute.

        Once the General Assembly has made a determination that the power to reorganize state government in the interim periods between legislative sessions does exist, and determines that that power is in the hands of the Governor, such interim action is purely an executive function; accordingly, any authority given to the Legislative Research Commission to veto or substantially affect this statutorily instituted executive function is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.

        Governor of Kentucky properly issued an executive order, which made several temporary changes to various state education boards, because the boards fell within the ambit of the Governor’s statutory authority to temporarily reorganize boards outside of the legislative session. Furthermore, the Governor’s power did not violate the suspension or the education provisions of the Kentucky Constitution, or the separation of powers doctrine generally and the non-delegation doctrine specifically.

        The reorganization authority must be granted to the Executive Branch of state government and to the Chief Executive Officer, the Governor; under Ky. Const., § 69 the General Assembly cannot create a state executive agency and grant executive reorganization authority to such an agency because supreme executive power must be vested in the Governor.

        The provision of Acts 1982, ch. 447, giving the Legislative Research Commission authority to approve or disapprove a temporary reorganization by the Governor (this section) is unconstitutional since the General Assembly’s granting of reorganization authority to the Governor may not be subject to the approval of the Legislative Research Commission; the Legislative Research Commission’s exercise of such veto/approval authority would be tantamount to the General Assembly’s acting when not in session, which is prohibited by the separation of powers doctrine, Ky. Const., §§ 27, 28 and also 36; and, even if an attempt were made to establish the Legislative Research Commission as an executive agency, the General Assembly is prohibited by Ky. Const., § 69 from granting reorganization authority to such agency or any other created state executive agency if that authority is superior to that of the Governor.

        Departments and agencies of the central state government can legally pay, out of the current operational account, the travel expenses of out-of-state persons invited to Kentucky for screening employment interviews, involving high level state management or cabinet positions, when the prospective employee will not agree to pay such expenses.

       For the purpose of this section, “minority” means American Indian; Alaskan native; African-American; Hispanic, including persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Central or South American origin; Pacific islander; or other ethnic group underrepresented on state boards and commissions.

       Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the members of each administrative board or commission shall be citizens of Kentucky appointed by the Governor from the state at large on the basis of their interests in public affairs, their good judgment, and their knowledge and ability in the field of action of the department for which appointed, with a view to providing diversity of interests and points of view in the membership and without regard to their political or religious opinions or affiliations.

       Where appointments to administrative boards and commissions are made from lists submitted to him, the Governor may reject the list and require that other lists be submitted. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, in the event the current membership of a board or commission reflects a proportion of the minority group less than the proportion of the minority group in the total population of the Commonwealth, then the Governor may appoint a member of the minority group even if the list of nominees for a vacancy does not include a member of the minority group.

       Before entering upon the duties of their office, all members of administrative boards and commissions shall take the oath of office prescribed by Section 228 of the Constitution.

       When a board, commission, or similar administrative body is established and no provision is made for compensation of members, members shall serve without pay, but may receive reimbursement for their actual and necessary expenses.

        In a declaratory action by unsuccessful nominees from an initial list, although KRS 164.005(5)(a), which specifically applied to the appointment of board of regents members, could be interpreted to require the Governor to make such an appointment from the first list of nominees, such a construction would require the first sentence of KRS 12.070(3) to be given no effect; thus, the Governor properly made an appointment from the third list submitted.

        did not apply because the opinion of the OAG hearing officer was not an opinion of the OAG; rather, it was a quasi-judicial opinion rendered as part of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Transportation Cabinet, Department of Vehicle Regulation’s administrative hearing process and was an opinion of the Cabinet. The dispute in this case actually involved a conflict between two statutes; therefore, the conflict did not have to be resolved by the Governor’s office. Commonwealth v.

       The General Assembly recognizes that many persons with disabilities and their families receive some level of support and services that are funded or administered by state agencies. The support and services are provided to persons with disabilities or their families, if appropriate, either directly or through arrangements with local community-based vendors, organizations, or agencies.
      </li>
      <li id="tIIIc12-personswithdisabilitiess12.455ol12">
       The General Assembly recognizes that persons with disabilities who receive the services and support, directly or indirectly, are often not consulted for their perspectives, nor are their viewpoints sought regarding the efficiency, strengths, or weaknesses of the services and support.
      </li>
      <li id="tIIIc12-personswithdisabilitiess12.455ol13">
       Persons with disabilities and their families face obstacles in the court system through lack of understanding and difficulty of access.

      <li id="tIIIc12-personswithdisabilitiess12.455ol14">
       Various agencies in state government promulgate standards that govern the administration or operation of the services and support. Seldom are persons with disabilities or their families involved in the development of standards that directly affect the quality of the services and support that they receive. In addition, there are legislative commissions that serve in an advisory capacity concerning the services provided to persons with disabilities and their families, whose membership does not include persons with disabilities and their families.

        <li id="tIIIc12-personswithdisabilitiess12.455ol15a">
         Some forms of discrimination against persons with disabilities continue.

         Persons with disabilities and their families should be provided with meaningful opportunities to contribute their perspectives through their experiences concerning issues relating to services, support, and standards that ultimately affect them;

        <li id="tIIIc12-personswithdisabilitiess12.455ol15d">

        Kentucky Public Service Commission (Commission) was entitled to a writ of prohibition as to a trial court hearing an interlocutory appeal of the Commission’s order denying real parties in interest intervention in a rate-making case because (1) the parties had no such right, as the parties could only request intervention, (2) whether to grant intervention was solely within the Commission’s discretion, (3) ordering the Commission to grant intervention interfered with the Commission’s proceedings, exceeded the court’s jurisdiction, and did not meet the collateral order rule, (4) the rule of civil procedure on intervention did not apply, as the Commission’s regulation controlled, and (5) the court had no Declaratory Judgment Act jurisdiction, so the court’s orders were void ab initio.

       When promulgating administrative regulations and reviewing existing ones, administrative bodies shall, whenever possible, tier their administrative regulations to reduce disproportionate impacts on certain classes of regulated entities, including government or small business, or both, and to avoid regulating entities that do not contribute significantly to the problem the administrative regulation was designed to address. The tiers, however, shall be based upon reasonable criteria and uniformly applied to an entire class. Administrative bodies shall use any number of tiers that will solve most efficiently and effectively the problem the administrative regulation addresses. A written statement shall be submitted to the Legislative Research Commission explaining why tiering was or was not used.

        et seq. had considerable discretion in admitting and excluding evidence, and, thus, a reviewing court would only reverse the hearing officers evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. In a case involving the tenured teacher’s termination of employment for having sexual contact with two students, the hearing officer was authorized to deny the tenured teacher’s request to exclude evidence that the tenured teacher had been acquitted of criminal charges involving one of the students, as that evidence was both irrelevant and was excludable under KRE. 403 as potentially confusing to the administrative tribunal because the criminal trial had a different burden of proof than the administrative proceeding.

        Horse-racing stewards’ decision to disqualify a horse was not a final order of an agency, and thus, it was not subject to judicial review because the process that the stewards undertook to make their decision was not an “administrative hearing,” as that term was used in the statutory definition of “final order of an agency,” and the stewards’ call was not a “final order” as it was not “made effective by an agency head,” as was necessary to issue a final administrative order.

        Clearly, the State Evaluation Appeals Panel (SEAP) is a review panel possessing very limited statutorily defined functions, and no provision exists for a hearing officer, the presentation or cross-examination of witnesses or any of the traditional hallmarks of an administrative hearing. The SEAP merely reviews the actions of the LEAP to determine compliance with an approved evaluation plan and thereby provide accountability and encouragement for local districts to implement appropriate evaluation plans. The SEAP is not empowered to reinstate a teacher to a prior position or provide any other remedy apart from setting aside a defective evaluation. Therefore, the SEAP does not conduct administrative hearings and actions of the SEAP do not come within the purview of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. ch. 13B. Geron v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Educ., 2018

       <p>
        Energy and environment cabinet secretary’s finding that farmers were the individuals with primary responsibility for farms’ day to-day operations was supported by substantial evidence; as there was much factual dispute and evidence presented, the trial court had to determine if the decision of the Energy and environment cabinet secretary was supported by substantial evidence, the trial court issued an opinion that was contrary to this standard, and the court disagreed with the trial court’s holding in this regard.

        (Ky. Ct. App. May 25, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        As substantial evidence supported the energy and environment cabinet secretary’s finding that farmers were the individuals with primary responsibility for farms’ day-today operations, reversal would have only been proper if the secretary incorrectly applied the law to the facts, but the court did not find that to be the case; the trial court imposed its own interpretation of the law instead of deferring to the cabinet’s interpretation, the secretary’s interpretation was reasonable and entitled to deference, and reversal of the trial court’s decision was proper.

       </p>
       <p>
        Mere fact that the legislature declined to adopt administrative regulations imposing per se integrator liability cannot in and of itself be interpreted to mean that an individual who is primarily responsible, as that term is defined by Kentucky law, cannot be required to sign as a co-permittee, if in fact such a finding is supported by substantial evidence.

       <p>
        Permits issues to farmers were no-discharge permits, and the energy and environment cabinet secretary’s ruling on the issue was supported by substantial evidence and otherwise proper; the trial court found that permits ran afoul of KRS

        Energy and environment cabinet’s special condition authority was properly exercised and the secretary’s decision was supported by substantial evidence, as experts were consulted, setbacks that were established were rationally related to the permit operations, and the setbacks were made according to the best professional judgment of the cabinet.

The hearing officer shall exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or excludable on constitutional or statutory grounds or on the basis of evidentiary privilege recognized in the courts of this Commonwealth. Hearsay evidence may be admissible, if it is the type of evidence that reasonable and prudent persons would rely on in their daily affairs, but it shall not be sufficient in itself to support an agency’s findings of facts unless it would be admissible over objections in civil actions.

       In all administrative hearings, unless otherwise provided by statute or federal law, the party proposing the agency take action or grant a benefit has the burden to show the propriety of the agency action or entitlement to the benefit sought. The agency has the burden to show the propriety of a penalty imposed or the removal of a benefit previously granted. The party asserting an affirmative defense has the burden to establish that defense. The party with the burden of proof on any issue has the burden of going forward and the ultimate burden of persuasion as to that issue. The ultimate burden of persuasion in all administrative hearings is met by a preponderance of evidence in the record, except when a higher standard of proof is required by law. Failure to meet the burden of proof is grounds for a recommended order from the hearing officer.

While the ultimate burden of persuasion is not moved from the party upon which it was originally cast (the claimant), the systems must come forward with some evidence in rebuttal where a claimant makes a threshold showing that his or her condition was not preexisting, and, while the fact-finder is free to accept or reject any evidence it chooses, it is not free to reject uncontested evidence; therefore, the fact-finder was not free to reject the unrebutted testimony of a doctor relating to the fact that it was highly unlikely that an employee had experienced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on the year of his re-employment, despite his smoking.

The hearing officer had to make such a finding in the first instance, pursuant to KRS 13B.090(1) and KRS 13B110(1), which the Board was then to review pursuant to KRS 13B.120(2) and (3), followed by the trial court’s review and, then, review by the appellate court under KRS 13B.150(2).

A party shall institute an appeal by filing a petition in the Circuit Court of venue, as provided in the agency’s enabling statutes, within thirty (30) days after the final order of the agency is mailed or delivered by personal service. If venue for appeal is not stated in the enabling statutes, a party may appeal to Franklin Circuit Court or the Circuit Court of the county in which the appealing party resides or operates a place of business. Copies of the petition shall be served by the petitioner upon the agency and all parties of record. The petition shall include the names and addresses of all parties to the proceeding and the agency involved, and a statement of the grounds on which the review is requested.

        Circuit court had jurisdiction to hear an appeal by a horse trainer and owner (the appellees) because they filed their petition for appeal before the 30-day deadline and, even though they did not serve a summons on the Attorney General, they commenced the action in good faith, there was no evidence of deceit, and when the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission moved to dismiss the appeal, the appellees corrected the error within 14 days.

        Circuit court correctly allowed a case to proceed because the case was commenced in good faith since a trainer and an owner gave copies of their appeal to the Attorney General and to agents of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission within the 30-day timeframe and had summonses issued; they intended to properly commence the action and believed a summons was not necessary, and that belief was reasonable based on the wording of the statute and the lack of published case law on the issue.

        Energy and environment cabinet secretary’s finding that farmers were the individuals with primary responsibility for farms’

        As substantial evidence supported the energy and environment cabinet secretary’s finding that farmers were the individuals with primary responsibility for farms’

        Finding that appellants were the ones with primary responsibility for farm day-to-day operations was supported by substantial evidence, and the secretary’s interpretation of the regulation was reasonable and required to be afforded deference; as the trial court imposed its own interpretation of the law instead of deferring to the cabinet’s interpretation, reversal of the trial court was appropriate.

        As there was much factual dispute and much evidence presented, it was the trial court’s duty to determine if the secretary’s opinion was supported by substantial evidence, and the court disagreed with the finding that another farm had primary responsibility. Adams v. Sharp, 2012

        Permits were no-discharge permits, and thus a discharge could not be assumed, the secretary’s rulings was supported by substantial evidence, and the court found no reason to disturb the decision of the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet Division of Water not to exercise its special condition authority.

        Substantial evidence supported the Kentucky Retirement Systems Board of Trustee’s decision denying the former employee’s application for disability benefits because two physicians, a vocational consultant, and an exercise physiologist provided credible and convincing evidence that the employee was capable of performing medium-duty work, and the employee’s proof and his physicians’ evidence was not so compelling that no reasonable person could fail to be persuaded by it.

        Kentucky Horse Racing Authority (KHRA) disqualifed a harness horse as the winner of two (2) races due to the presence of flunixin in its urine. The Circuit Court properly affirmed this decision because (1) the KHRA’s finding was not arbitrary and capricious, as it was supported by substantial evidence; (2) it was unnecessary to establish a perfect chain of custody and the evidence showed there was no tampering with the urine samples; (3) the “trainer responsibility rule” (811 KAR 1:090) was constitutional; (4) there was no double jeopardy violation, since the action was civil in nature; (5) 811 KAR 1:090, § 4(1), which outlawed flunixin for harness horses but not thoroughbreds, did not violate equal protection principles.

The hearing officer had to make such a finding in the first instance, pursuant to KRS 13B.090(1) and KRS 13B.110(1), which the Board was then to review pursuant to KRS 13B.120(2) and (3), followed by the trial court’s review and, then, review by the appellate court under KRS 13B.150(2).

        Under the McManus standard, a court cannot substitute its judgment on those contested issues of fact but if the appealing party has not met his burden of proof with the fact-finder, the court can properly, indeed must, consider whether that party’s proof was so compelling that no reasonable person could have failed to be persuaded.

The mere fact that a complainant may have been using prescription medication at the time of the incident did not amount to a substantial possibility of the doctor winning on the merits, as required under Kentucky law.

      The fee in this section for each filing with the secretary of state required by KRS 355.9-401 has been raised from $3.00 to $8.00 to conform with the amendment to KRS 355.9-401 in 1986 Acts, ch. 204, § 8.

     <p>
      The payment of the filing fee is a condition precedent for filing documents with the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State may void the filing and return a document after it has been received, stamped, and filed, where the check for payment of that fee has been dishonored.

        In action against corporation, where there was evidence in the form of an affidavit of the Secretary of State that he had placed in the mail a summons and a copy of the complaint and that no receipt or returned mail was ever received by him, and there was no affidavit or even suggestion from the corporation indicating that the summons and complaint was not received in the mail, personal jurisdiction was conferred through the long-arm statute, even though there was a registered and available statutory agent for process at all times within the state; therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in entering a default judgment against the corporation.

        Although the Attorney General may be authorized to represent state employes in civil actions where the negligence of an individual operating a state-owned vehicle furnished for his regular use while on official business is brought into issue, he does not have a duty to do so, particularly where the defense of the interest of the Commonwealth is not a definite element of the action.

        It is the duty of the Attorney General to represent state officers or departments in litigation in which the Commonwealth has an interest, but a state officer or employee does not have an enforceable right to representation when he is sued individually unless the Attorney General or the legal counsel of the department believes the state has an interest in the litigation.

        Kentucky Attorney General’s opinions are advisory in nature and are not legally binding on officials or other parties; they are generally followed by local officials; they are designed to reflect not the private construction of the author but that construction which the Attorney General believes the courts would arrive at if faced with similar facts.

        Recipient governmental officials are expected to conform to the rulings of the Attorney General; this concept of reasonable expectation of conforming to the Attorney General’s opinion applies until a court decision decrees otherwise in a judicial case, or the General Assembly changes the law. The concept of conforming to such opinions is in the public interest, for reasons of consistency and uniform interpretation and administrative or executive action ensuing therefrom.

      Recipient governmental officials are expected to conform to the rulings of the Attorney General; this concept of reasonable expectation of conforming to the Attorney General’s opinion applies until a court decision decrees otherwise in a judicial case, or the General Assembly changes the law. The concept of conforming to such opinions is in the public interest, for reasons of consistency and uniform interpretation and administrative or executive action ensuing therefrom.

        The intent of this section is apparently to allow the executive and not the Attorney General to determine when the Attorney General can decide whether to intervene, participate in, or exclusively direct the investigation and prosecution of criminal activities. Hancock v. Schroering, 481 S.W.2d 57, 1972
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 221

        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        The meaning of the words “in a given case” is equivalent to “in any given situation.” Hancock v. Schroering, 481 S.W.2d 57, 1972

       <p>
        Where the Attorney General had been requested to participate in an investigation, he thereafter had the right to exclusively control the investigation and any resultant prosecutions in the limited area defined and was not restricted to working in conjunction with the local Commonwealth’s attorney. Hancock v. Schroering, 481 S.W.2d 57, 1972

        , the Kentucky Attorney General did not have the common law power to investigate and prosecute cases at will, nor was the enactment of KRS 15.020 a grant of such a power; however, the subsequent enactment of KRS

        is a specific grant of authority to the Attorney General to investigate and prosecute cases in limited circumstances. Accordingly, the Attorney General’s power and authority to investigate and prosecute cases is defined by KRS 15.200. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2012

        Where the Court of Appeals of Kentucky reversed a trial court’s denial of defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment, KRS 218A.240(1) provided the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) with clear authority to make arrests regarding controlled substances, and the indictments were valid. KRS

        had nothing to do with the investigative authority of the OAG, other than recognizing that which may have existed at common law, and KRS 15.200(1) was a limitation on the prosecutorial authority of the OAG. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 423 S.W.3d 718, 2014

        , the Attorney General was without authority to initiate an investigation into controlled substance violations, which led to appellant’s grand jury indictment.

        Because Kentucky does not have a unified prosecutorial system and Commonwealth’s attorneys do not answer to the Attorney General, the Attorney General, by virtue of his being elected by the public, is in a unique position to defend the constitutionality of an act of the General Assembly and must be given the opportunity at the trial level to do so; therefore the notice requirements of this section must be met in criminal as well as in civil actions.

      <li id="tIIIc15-kentuckylawenforcementcouncils15.315ol11">
       The Attorney General of Kentucky, the commissioner of the Department of Kentucky State Police, the commissioner of the Department of Criminal Justice Training, the chief of police of the Louisville Metro Police Department, the chief of police of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Division of Police, the director of the Southern Police Institute of the University of Louisville, the dean of the College of Justice and Safety of Eastern Kentucky University, the president of the Kentucky Peace Officers Association, the president of the Kentucky Association of Chiefs of Police, the Kentucky president of the Fraternal Order of Police, the president of the Kentucky Women’s Law Enforcement Network, and the president of the Kentucky Sheriffs’ Association shall be ex officio members of the council, as full voting members of the council by reason of their office. The United States attorneys for the Eastern and Western Districts of Kentucky may confer and designate a local law enforcement liaison who shall serve on the council in an advisory capacity only without voting privileges. Each ex officio member may designate in writing a person to represent him or her and to vote on his or her behalf. Designees of the Department of Kentucky State Police, Department of Criminal Justice Training, Louisville Metro Police Department, and the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Division of Police shall be the head of the agency’s training division or the agency’s deputy chief or deputy commissioner.

       Twelve (12) members shall be appointed by the Governor for terms of four (4) years from the following classifications: a city manager or mayor, a county judge/executive, three (3) Kentucky sheriffs, a member of the Kentucky State Bar Association, five (5) chiefs of police, and a citizen of Kentucky not coming within the foregoing classifications. No person shall serve beyond the time he or she holds the office or employment by reason of which he or she was initially eligible for appointment. Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment and the successor shall be appointed for the unexpired term. Any member may be appointed for additional terms.
      </li>
      <li id="tIIIc15-kentuckylawenforcementcouncils15.315ol13">
       No member may serve on the council with the dual membership as the representative of more than one (1) of the aforementioned groups or the holder of more than one (1) of the aforementioned positions. In the event that an existing member of the council assumes a position entitling him to serve on the council in another capacity, the Governor shall appoint an additional member from the group concerned to prevent dual membership.

      <li id="tIIIc15-kentuckylawenforcementcouncils15.315ol14">
       Membership on the council does not constitute a public office, and no member shall be disqualified from holding public office by reason of his membership.

      The use of the term “chief of police” in subsection (2) of this section does not include the director of security of the park rangers of the Kentucky Department of Parks, so that one appointed to the Kentucky Law Enforcement Council as one of the five police chiefs required by this section was not eligible for reappointment when he resigned his position as chief of police to take the job of director of the park rangers.

        When a police officer allegedly falsified information to maintain his law enforcement certification, but was allowed to resign from his employment for “personal reasons,” the law enforcement council responsible for certifying police officers could not revoke the officer’s certification based on the alleged falsification of information without giving the officer minimal due process rights to challenge the falsification allegation.

An agency must either follow its precedents or provide a reasoned analysis for its departure from them. A police agency is liable under

     <p>
      A city police department did not violate the Open Records Act in denying a request to inspect all documentation and records related to the requester’s application for the position of police recruit since subsection (3) prohibits disclosure of specifically described information obtained in the application/certification process to peace officers, unsuccessful applicants who wished to become peace officers, and third parties; the prohibition is, by its own terms, mandatory, and extends not only to background investigations, but also to psychological examinations and polygraph examinations administered pursuant to subsection (2) and KRS

      . OAG 00-ORD-118.

     <p>
      Because the confidentiality provision codified at KRS 15.400(3) does not extend by its express terms to pre-December 1, 1998, psychological examination records, and because the requester was employed in 1992, KRS 15.400(3) does not apply to psychological records in the City’s custody that relate to the requester. The requester is entitled to inspect and receive copies of her psychological records under authority of KRS 61.878(3). OAG 03-ORD-43.

        A legally constituted police authority is not a local unit of government as it is not a city nor a county and not a combination of cities and counties but the police department of two cities acting together similar to that of a police department of a single city and it has no independent taxing power, condemnation power or power to enact statutes and ordinances, so it cannot operate by itself in the same manner as a political subdivision can.

        Pension contributions should be deducted from the fifteen percent (15%) incentive pay paid to police officers from the Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program fund and an officer’s salary on which his pension is based should include such incentive pay.

        Since by the Department of Justice (now Justice Cabinet) regulations a police officer’s base salary does not include overtime pay, the fifteen percent (15%) incentive funds reimbursed to a police department would not include fifteen percent (15%) of overtime pay.

        Where a city erroneously paid Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program Fund funds to one of its injured policemen, and the policeman subsequently resigned asking for a refund of his contributions to the pension fund pursuant to KRS 95.620(2), the city had to refund the funds to KLEFPF or risk having its participation terminated; the policeman should have also repaid such funds to the city, but if he did not the pension fund trustees could not withhold his contributions to the fund since if the trustees elected to return such contributions they had to refund all of such contributions and could not withhold a sum from the contributions representing what he owed to KLEFPF.

        The Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program Fund (KLEFPF) reimburses a police department $2,500 per year for each eligible police officer who must be paid such sum. If such officers work overtime (beyond 40 hours per week), the local police department is required to pay said officer overtime pay, including KLEFPF money in determining such overtime rate, just as it would be so required if none of the officer’s salary were reimbursed by KLEFPF.

        The salary supplement which a local unit of government receives from the Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program Fund (KLEFPF) for its qualified police officers in the program should either go to the qualified officers or be refunded to the KLEFPF if overpayment results; the governmental unit has no right to any part of the officers’ money. Accordingly, even though a particular officer received no base salary for the three days he was off (without annual leave or sick leave balance), he was entitled to his KLEFPF incentive pay money for that month.

      Where the city of Louisville proposed a normal salary increase for its police officers but the United States Cost of Living Council ruled that the city could not pay any salary increase to its policemen during that year except for the 9.5 percent salary supplement payable by the state, the provision of this section providing that the salary supplement may not supplant the existing salaries or normal periodic pay increases would not prevent the payment of the supplement to the city for the salaries of its police officers, since the city’s failure to grant the normal periodic pay increase was caused not by any act of its own but by the order of the federal Cost of Living Council.

        A discharged employee in a Circuit Court upon judicial review is entitled to something less than a trial de novo, a quasi trial de novo as it were; the trial court in its review is to consider both the transcript and additional testimony, and it is limited to a determination of whether the administrative body acted arbitrarily in deciding whether the employee violated the rules and regulations of the police department.

        The function of the hearing body in instances of charges against police officers is to make two determinations: first, whether the officer has violated the rules and regulations of the department and if so, second, it must exercise its discretion in imposing a penalty.

        Since the mayor under the councilmanic form of government has the sole authority under KRS 83A.080(2) and 83A.130(9) to remove nonelected officers and employees, he, rather than the council, would have the responsibility of hearing disciplinary charges against a police officer unless he has promulgated a hearing proceeding otherwise that has been approved by the council under KRS 83A.130(4); on the other hand, the council could, under the authority of KRS 83A.080(2) and 83A.130(9), enact an ordinance establishing a hearing board to hear the charges, the members of which are to be appointed by the mayor with the approval of the council under KRS 83A.080(2).

        Subsection (1)(h) of this section when read in conjunction with the section as a whole clearly implies that police officers against whom complaints are filed are entitled to a due process hearing as therein provided though admittedly the statutory language of subsection (1)(h) of this section is somewhat ambiguous; the use of the phrase “when a hearing is to be conducted by any appointing authority … ” simply means that a hearing is predicated on the initial finding by the authority or body designated to take action in the matter and that the complaint is not frivolous and thus warrants a full investigation to determine its authenticity.

        This section, in part, establishes administrative due process rights for municipal police officers charged with professional misconduct or violations of municipal rules and regulations; thus, if a city’s proposed policy of documenting the work performances of its employees involves charging police officers with professional misconduct or with violations of municipal rules and regulations, the city must adhere to the provisions of this section requiring notification to the police officers of the charges and a hearing relative to those charges, assuming the city and its police officers are participating in the Kentucky Law Enforcement Foundation Program fund.

        The individual designated by the Attorney General as a temporary or interim Commonwealth’s attorney pursuant to subsection (4) of this section is not a

    officer. Such person holds the position pursuant to statutory authorization, and therefore would not be a de jure officer.

       <p>
        Circuit clerks are not at all subject to the supervision of prosecutors, but of the judiciary, and the fact that a warrant must be prepared by the Commonwealth’s or county attorney has nothing to do with the clerk’s exercise of independent judgment in deciding whether probable cause has been shown to justify issuance of warrant; furthermore, the determination of probable cause is made not from the warrant but from the supporting affidavit or affidavits.

        While subsection (4) (now (5)) of this section specifically provides that a county clerk can issue a criminal warrant prepared by a county attorney when no district judge, circuit judge or trial commissioner is available, the authority to sign the judge’s name to an arrest warrant cannot be delegated to the county attorney since Ky. Const., § 28, prohibits anyone in one branch of government from exercising the power in another branch of government, the county attorney being in the executive branch under Ky. Const., § 99, and the judicial branch being under Ky. Const., § 109. Dugger v. Off 2nd, Inc., 612 S.W.2d 756, 1980

        Where county attorney issued arrest warrant and signed district judge’s name thereon, he was acting outside the scope of his power under this section and exercising judicial rather than executive branch powers which is prohibited under Ky.

        It could hardly be disputed that the Commonwealth’s attorney is in charge of the prosecution of violations of criminal and penal laws and that plea bargaining is a part of the process. While RCr 8.10 does not expressly state that the plea agreement shall be between the defendant and the Commonwealth’s attorney, such a view is necessarily implied by virtue of the role conferred upon the trial court.

        Under RCr 5.14 and subsection (1) of this section, the Commonwealth’s attorney may make suggestions to the grand jury, where he has carefully assessed the potential evidence and actually and honestly believes that technically no criminal conduct is involved sufficient to support an indictment, that in his professional opinion no public interest would be subserved by their hearing such proffered witnesses. However, it would then lie within their sound discretion, considering their duty of inquiring into the commission of crime as to whether or not such proffered witnesses would be heard by them.

        Actual prejudice had to be shown before the Commonwealth Attorney’s entire staff would be disqualified from prosecuting charges against a defendant, whose original appointed attorney had moved from the county public defender’s staff to the Commonwealth Attorney’s office; the mere possibility of the appearance of impropriety was not sufficient to disqualify the entire prosecutorial staff.

        Defendant could not show that any member of the forum county’s prosecutorial staff conducted substantial and personal preparation involving an exchange of confidential information in connection with defendant’s case where defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, first offense, and carrying a concealed deadly weapon.

        Defendant’s due process rights were not violated where, after he was tried and convicted for second-degree assault, the prosecutor from defendant’s criminal trial brought on behalf of one of the complaining witnesses and against defendant, a civil action stemming from the same incident.

        It was not reversible error for the trial judge to deny a continuance in the sentencing hearing or to disqualify the prosecutors in a murder case merely because the prosecutors had become involved in a civil case arising out of the robbery and murders. Neither defendant was a party to the civil action, nor have they alleged or proved actual prejudice arising from the complained of involvement in the civil case. Dunbar v.

        Defendant’s contention that the prosecutor should have disqualified himself because the defendant’s father had punched the prosecutor on a prior occasion was without merit; the inquiry by the trial judge established that the prosecutor bore no ill feeling toward defendant.

        No personal and substantial relationship existed between attorney’s representation of defendant in an earlier case, in which retrial conviction was used in the instant persistent felony offender proceeding, and the trial of this case that required any substantive need for disqualification under this section where attorney represented defendant in guilty plea to earlier unrelated charges, conviction was reversed upon appeal, and upon retrial attorney had disqualified himself because he became employed by the Commonwealth Attorney’s office.

        Where prosecutor had represented defendant in his private practice, subsequent to the arson charge, in a bankruptcy proceeding and, as such, had detailed knowledge of her financial situation and since the alleged motive was financial gain, the bankruptcy was integrally related to the matter being prosecuted and the prosecutor should have recused himself from the case.

      County attorney could legally conduct a private practice in the county attorney’s office, whether it is located in the courthouse or in a privately owned building as long as he pays the percentage of the rental value corresponding to the percentage of time the property is used for his private practice.

       The phrase “total compensation as county attorney which he received during the calendar year 1976” means “the incumbent county attorney” instead of “he” and therefore, the compensation of that office in 1976 is the measure of the prosecutorial compensation of a county attorney serving in January, 1978, and thereafter, and there is no difference in compensation of a county attorney who was not in office in 1976 and a county attorney who was; the county attorney in 1978, regardless of whether he ever served as county attorney before 1978 or not, should receive from the state for his prosecutorial duties an amount equal to the total compensation received by the incumbent county attorney as compensation for his public duties in that office.

        <li id="tIIIc15As15A.0652ol11a">

      (7/15/14). In subsection (3)(d)3. of this statute, the Reviser of Statutes has changed the words “paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection” to read “subparagraphs 1. and 2. of this paragraph.” In an early version of the bill that created this statute (2014 Ky. Acts ch. 132, sec. 5), the phrase “paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection” was used in reference to language corresponding to the present subparagraphs 1. and 2. When the bill was redrafted before its final passage, the numbering of the paragraphs was changed, but the reference was inadvertently left unchanged. The Reviser of Statutes has made this correction under the authority of KRS 7.136(1).

Acts ch. 85, sec. 37, proposed to create this section relating to the Criminal Justice Council within the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet as a new section of KRS Chapter 15. However, since KRS Chapter 15 relates to the Department of Law and KRS Chapter 15A relates to the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(a), the Reviser of Statutes in codification has placed this section in KRS Chapter 15A rather than KRS Chapter 15.

The charges shall be signed by the person making the same, and shall set out with clarity and distinction each and every charge. The commissioner, whenever probable cause appears, shall prefer charges against any officer whom he believes to have been guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, in the interest of public order. Within five (5) days after the filing of charges, the Office of Internal Affairs shall deliver a copy thereof, personally, by certified mail, return receipt requested to the officer offending. Within five (5) days after the receipt thereof, the officer may demand public hearing, or may admit the truth of the charges in whole or in part.

If any person fails to comply with any lawful order of the department or with process, or if any witness refuses to testify concerning any matter in which he may lawfully be interrogated, any Circuit Judge, upon application of the trial board, or the commissioner, may compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of a subpoena issued from the Circuit Court or a refusal to testify in that court.

Any person may present charges in writing against any officer, which shall be filed with the Office of Internal Affairs, which shall be designated by the commissioner as the recipient of charges and shall be administratively responsible for the maintenance of good order within the department through the collection and investigation of charges and the retention of their dispositions. The charges shall be signed by the person filing the charges, and shall set out with clarity and distinction each and every charge. The commissioner, whenever probable cause appears, shall present charges against any officer whom he believes to have been guilty of conduct justifying his removal or punishment, in the interest of public order. Within five (5) days after the filing of charges, the Office of Internal Affairs shall deliver a copy thereof, personally, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the officer offending. Within five (5) days after the receipt thereof, the officer may demand a public hearing, or may admit the truth of the charges in whole or in part.

If any person fails to comply with any lawful order of the department or with process, or if any witness refuses to testify concerning any matter in which he may lawfully be interrogated, any Circuit Judge, upon application of the trial board or the commissioner, may compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of a subpoena issued from the Circuit Court or a refusal to testify in that court.

      (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky. Acts ch. 107), did not comply with the three-readings rule of Kentucky Constitution Section 46 and that the legislation is, therefore, constitutionally invalid and declared void. That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.

      (7/14/2018). This statute was amended by
      2018 Ky. Acts chs. 107 and
      151, which do not appear to be in conflict and have been codified together.

        District Court abused its discretion in setting date on which prejudgment interest was to begin to accrue in case involving the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s challenge to mandatory retirement of state troopers at age fifty-five (55); prejudgment interest should have begun to apply on the first day of the second year of the back-pay award as that approach complied with purpose behind awarding prejudgment interest and conformed to wishes of officers involved who were to choose when prejudgment interest would apply.

        District Court had legal authority to include overtime pay in state troopers’ awards of back-pay in case involving Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s challenge to mandatory retirement of state troopers at age fifty-five (55), as existing precedent held that sick leave, vacation pay, pension benefits and other fringe benefits the claimant would have received but for discrimination should also be awarded, and District Court’s factual findings on the amount of compensatory time to which troopers were entitled was not clearly erroneous.

        District Court abused its discretion in denying Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) motion to amend its complaint to add the names of three officers who were not included in original complaint because Kentucky’s Retirement Board, which furnished names of potential claimants to EEOC, failed to include the three officer’s names due to fact that officers had retired before their fifty-fifth birthdays in reliance on Kentucky’s mandatory policy of retirement for state troopers in case involving EEOC’s challenge to mandatory retirement of state troopers at age fifty-five (55). Kentucky State Police Department was on notice about the nature of claims that would be brought against it by officers retired under the policy, and to allow officer’s involved to bring their complaints would have posed no hardship to department.

        District Court’s finding, that state troopers who retired in reliance on state’s mandatory retirement policy mitigated their damages, was not clearly erroneous in case involving Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s challenge to mandatory retirement of state troopers at age fifty-five (55). EEOC v. Kentucky State Police Dep't, 80 F.3d 1086, 1996 FED App. 0108P, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 6047 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 963, 117 S. Ct. 385, 136 L.

         6.Age Discrimination.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (15) of this section mandatorily retires state troopers on the first day of the month following their fifty-fifth birthday, and, as such, it facially discriminates between troopers younger than fifty-five (55) years of age and those older than fifty-five (55) years of age: therefore, a claim becomes ripe when this section is applied, as when the state trooper is mandatorily retired. (Decided prior to 2008 amendment) EEOC v. Kentucky State Police Dep't, 80 F.3d 1086, 1996 FED App. 0108P, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 6047 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 963, 117 S. Ct. 385, 136 L.

         7.— Tolling of Statute of Limitations.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        District Court abused its discretion by not tolling the statute of limitations period beginning April 6, 1978, the date the Age Discrimination in Employment Act became applicable to states and localities, where it had previously decided that the limitations period should be tolled for troopers retired between 1979 and 1981, in case involving Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s challenge to mandatory retirement of state troopers at age fifty-five (55). EEOC v. Kentucky State Police Dep't, 80 F.3d 1086, 1996 FED App. 0108P, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 6047 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 963, 117 S. Ct. 385, 136 L. Ed. 2d 302, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 6602 (U.S. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equitable tolling of statute of limitation in case involving Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s challenge to mandatory retirement of state troopers at age fifty-five (55) was proper where officers involved did not learn of their rights under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) until Supreme Court’s 1983 decision in EEOC v. Wyoming; the District Court found that troopers lacked constructive notice of their rights under ADEA because of department’s failure to post required notices, that department policy manual omitted age discrimination as part of affirmation action policy, and that officers involved were diligent in pursuing their rights. EEOC v. Kentucky State Police Dep't, 80 F.3d 1086, 1996 FED App. 0108P, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 6047 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 963, 117 S. Ct. 385, 136 L.

       <p>
        In case involving the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s challenge to mandatory retirement of state troopers at age fifty-five (55), where Kentucky State Police Department (KSP), admitted that it did not post required Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) notices and could not prove that the notices in question were actually posted or seen by KSP troopers, even if the lower court’s decision to exclude evidence of the two memos KSP sought to introduce to show that state troopers had constructive knowledge of their right to be free from age discrimination under the (ADEA) and, as such, were not entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations amounted to an abuse of discretion, that decision would not be disturbed on appeal as it did not result in substantial injustice.

        Use of a employee’s actual years of service to calculate the employee’s disability retirement pension, rather than imputing additional years of service under KRS 16.582(5)(a), did not violate 29 USCS § 623(a)(1) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; additional years of service would have been imputed had the employee become disabled before rather than after reaching retirement age, but the disparity in treatment was based only upon pension eligibility and was not actually motivated by age.

      (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky. Acts ch. 107), did not comply with the three-readings rule of Kentucky Constitution Section 46 and that the legislation is, therefore, constitutionally invalid and declared void. That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.

      (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky.

That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.

      In light of the contractual obligation created by this section, the General Assembly may now limit retirement benefits to a certain maximum percentage of final annual salary only prospectively as to present nonretired and future members of the retirement plan.

      The General Assembly could enact legislation guaranteeing members of this retirement system only the amount each has contributed toward his retirement benefits but such legislation may not have retroactive effect.

      Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1 — 84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

      Since the taking of a child into custody is not an arrest, this section does not apply to a child who is transferred from juvenile court to Circuit Court for trial until after he has been convicted by the latter court, and fingerprinting and photographing him for record purposes prior to that time would be improper.

Acts ch. 158, the reference to “KRS 439.3401(1)” in subsection (2) of this statute was inadvertently changed to “KRS 439.340(1).” After examination of the materials in the bill folder, consultation with the drafter, and examination of KRS 439.340(1) and 439.3401(1), this manifest clerical or typographical error has been corrected during codification by the Reviser of Statutes under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(h).

The only limit on the court’s power to order outside testing is that it may do so only if it deems such testing appropriate. KRS

        In an action alleging wrongful termination in violation of public policy, the grant of the employer’s motion to dismiss was proper because the Sex Offender Registration Act did not create a public policy exception to the terminable-at-will doctrine. Despite the underlying public policy of protecting the public from sex offenders and the immunity provided by the Act, it did not provide an explicit right to disseminate information from the registry in a private workplace.

        KRS 17.510(10) was not unconstitutionally vague in requiring a registered sex offender who knew he or she would have a change of address to inform authorities; it was the failure to give notice of one’s change in residence, not homelessness, that was prohibited. Tobar v. Commonwealth, 2007
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. App. LEXIS 396
        </cite>
        (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 12, 2007), sub. op., 2007 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1042 (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 12, 2007), aff'd, 284 S.W.3d 133, 2009

        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of former KRS 17.510(7) to define “residence” did not cause the statute to be unconstitutionally vague because the language of the statute was sufficiently definite to put defendant on notice that if defendant failed to register as a sex offender when defendant moved from Tennessee, where defendant was registered as a sex offender, to Kentucky, defendant would be guilty of a crime. Commonwealth v. McBride, 281 S.W.3d 799, 2009

         Ky. LEXIS 52

       </p>
       <p>
        KRS 17.510(10)(a) was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant because, even though defendant became homeless when he was expelled from a center where he was living, this fact was irrelevant to the statute’s application; the statute did not require that a registrant must have had an actual place he was moving to. Further, KRS 17.510(10)(a) as written did not cause arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement and did not criminalize being homeless because all sex offenders, regardless of socioeconomic status, had to register with the proper authorities and report any change in address. Tobar v. Commonwealth, 284 S.W.3d 133, 2009
        <cite class="ky_code">

       <p>
        2006 amendment to KRS 17.510(11), which reclassified the failure to register from a misdemeanor to a felony, did not constitute a violation of a sex offender’s constitutional rights to be free from ex post facto laws because the amendment did not have a real and direct effect on the punishment for a sex offender’s past crimes but served only to affect the punishment for his commission of a future crime.

While a sex offender’s past conduct is the reason he or she is required to register, the failure to register occurs in the present; an increase in the degree of the offense for failing to register would only present an ex post facto issue if the act of failing to register occurred prior to the effective date of the amendment.

        (2000) is aimed at both sex crimes and crimes against minors, and that provides support that the Kentucky General Assembly’s purpose for including kidnapping a minor in the list of offenses requiring registration was aimed at protecting children from crime in general, not just sexually-related crime. Thus, inclusion of those convicted of a kidnapping involving a minor is rationally related to the General Assembly’s intent to protect children from crime. Cox v. Kentucky, 2010 U.S. Dist.

        When defendant was prosecuted under former KRS 17.510(7) for failing to register as a sex offender after defendant was convicted of a sex crime in Tennessee, registered as a sex offender there, and moved to Kentucky, the fact that defendant’s crime was committed before KRS 17.510(11) was amended did not cause the trial court to lack jurisdiction to convict defendant of a felony because defendant moved to Kentucky, and failed to register, after the statute was amended. Commonwealth v. McBride, 281 S.W.3d 799, 2009

       <p>
        From a plain reading of KRS 17.510(11), it is clear that the state legislature intended to expand the coverage of the felony penalty to include all registered sex offenders. By expressly providing that a sex offender’s first violation of the current version or prior versions of the sex offender law constitutes a Class D felony, the legislature intended to establish a uniform penalty for all sex offenders. As such, a sex offender’s violation of the registration law after the effective date of the 2006 amendment constituted a felony even if he would have been subject only to a misdemeanor under the law in effect at the time he was first required to register.

        Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 17.510(7) requires sex offender registration of any person who was required to register in another state upon that person's relocation to Kentucky.

        Because defendant pleaded guilty to criminal attempt to commit first-degree sexual abuse on a nine-year old victim, defendant committed a criminal offense (sex crime) against a victim who was a minor; accordingly, defendant was required to register as a sex offender under KRS 17.510(6).

        Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of mistake where he failed to register as a sex offender.

        Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of mistake where he failed to register as a sex offender, and it did not negate the “knowingly” mental state required for the offense. Defendant failed to show a mistaken belief of law based on his belief that he had to send in a new address when he received a form; defendant did not argue that he relied on something or someone official.

        Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence that defendant failed to register as a sex offender as required under KRS 17.510(11), and, thus, defendant’s conviction on that charge had to be upheld. The evidence was sufficient to support a charge under either KRS 17.510(6) or KRS 17.510(7), dealing with individuals convicted outside of Kentucky who relocated to Kentucky, as occurred with defendant, and the evidence also showed both that defendant resided in Kentucky and had not registered in violation of KRS 17.510(11).

        requiring lifetime registration applied to defendant, in that defendant’s conduct was criminal based solely upon the age of the victims, not because he had used forcible compulsion, and as a result, the trial court should have applied KRS 17.500(2)(b) to exempt defendant from the lifetime registration requirement. Dever v. Commonwealth, 300 S.W.3d 198, 2009

        Failure to advise of the lifetime registration requirement for a sex offender pursuant to statute does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because the requirement is nonpunitive and designed to protect the public. Therefore, an applicant was not entitled to postconviction relief based on the failure to give such advice in a case where he entered a guilty plea to three felony sex offenses against a minor. Embry v. Commonwealth, 476 S.W.3d 264, 2015

        Movant seeking postconviction relief must offer some proof of his claims to justify relief; bare allegations in the motion will not justify granting extraordinary relief. Therefore, an applicant's bare allegation that counsel told him that he would only have to register as a sex offender for a decade after entering a guilty plea to three felony sex offenses against a minor was insufficient to prove that relief was justified.

        While applying
        KRS § 17.545(2) retroactively implicates and necessitates an analysis of the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Kentucky Constitutions, the relevant portion of the statute is not punitive and therefore does not violate the ex post facto clauses.

        Circuit court properly dismissed an employee’s wrongful termination complaint against her employer for failure to state a claim because the employee failed to show that her termination—for informing some of her coworkers that one of their supervisors was a registered sex offender—fell under the public policy exception to the terminable-at-will doctrine inasmuch as the legislature did not intend to include private employees among those who were immune from suit.

        State’s attempt to deny permanent part-time employees a salary increase under a budget bill amounted to an improper penalization as state personnel board’s finding that they were full-time de facto employees entitled to the salary increase was supported by substantial evidence: they were told the permanent part-time employee was for regulatory purposes only, that they would have the same rights and benefits as permanent full-time employees, and the only difference between them and the full-time employees involved how overtime was paid.

        Order affirming the dismissal of an employee’s challenge to a written employment reprimand was proper because the exclusion of written reprimands from KRS 18A.005(24) and the creation of an administrative remedy for disciplinary actions were determinative of a legislative intent to foreclose appeal to the Kentucky Personnel Board for those aggrieved by written reprimand.

       <p>
        Clearly, the Personnel Department of state government has no authority to regulate university personnel matters, and any changes wrought in the laws pertaining to state employees governed by this Chapter have no bearing on university employees. Accordingly, this section and, to the extent that it merely cross references the latter provision, KRS 61.878(3) are inapplicable to university personnel policies and procedures.

       <p>
        The 1986 amendments to this section and KRS 61.878(3) do not preclude a university from properly withholding records under KRS 61.878(1)(a) through (j) when a request is made by a university employee for records pertaining to him.

        KRS 18A.095(29) did not include any exception from its one-year time limit for filing appeals of actions that penalized state employees based on continuing violations or ongoing penalization; thus, as Finance Cabinet employees were on notice as of January 1, 2003 that their duties were increasing without any change in their job classification or any pay grade increase, their appeals had to be filed by January 1, 2004 and not within one year of the Finance Cabinet’s acknowledgement in August 2004 that the employees had been penalized by the failure to reclassify them.

        A classified merit employee of this commonwealth is endowed with certain rights and protections, among those being the right of continued employment unless “just cause” for dismissal is demonstrated by the agency by whom he or she is employed; therefore, the rule that applicants before an administrative agency have the burden of proof has no application in a disciplinary proceeding involving such an employee.

        Where the board specifically found that grounds to discipline officer existed, but that the penalty imposed was excessive, the board having exercised its statutory prerogative to amend or modify appellant’s penalty as excessive, the Circuit Court on appeal was limited in its review of that action by former subsection (5) of this section and, in the absence of any of the grounds specified in that subsection, the Circuit Court erred by failing to affirm the board’s order in all respects.

        The state Personnel Board is a necessary party where a former employee files an appeal in the Circuit Court from a decision by the Board and the Cabinet for Human Resources to discharge her, and the Board remains a necessary party throughout the appellate process; accordingly, where a discharged employee failed to join the Board as a party in its appeal from the circuit court to the Court of Appeals, the appeal was dismissed.

        The notice required prior to reduction in rank or discharge shall be in sufficient detail to enable the employee to “reply thereto in writing” or to appear before and “reply” to the head of the department or his agent. (Decided under prior law) Goss v. Personnel Board, 456 S.W.2d 819, 1970

        The reason required to be given the employee discharged during the probationary period would be sufficient if it imparted to the employee the general nature of the complaint. (Decided under prior law) Miracle v. Gable, 452 S.W.2d 399, 1970

        Under a Personnel Department rule entitled “Separation During the Probationary Period,” the giving of 10 working days’ notice to the employee was directory as to time. (Decided under prior law) Miracle v. Gable, 452 S.W.2d 399, 1970

       <p>
        Under the Personnel Department rule regarding separation during the probationary period, the employer had a right to terminate the employee’s employment for any reason, political or otherwise, during the first six (6) months of employment, and that right continued up to the last day of the probationary period “without the right of appeal or hearing” to the employee.

       <p>
        Where the notice of termination during the probationary period given the employee not only advised her that her work was unsatisfactory but advised her in which area it was unsatisfactory when it referred to “assigned duties and responsibilities,” the reason stated was sufficient.

        The reasonable implication of the language of former provision providing for probation period is that the purpose of the probationary period is to determine whether or not an employee can satisfactorily perform the task required of a certain position.

        The denial of the employee’s rights to seek review of his discharge before the Personnel Board was arbitrary, where the employee was required to resign from the part-time “status” position to be reappointed the next day to the full-time position, there was no competition for the position when the employee’s classification was changed, and the employee was working full-time hours and the reclassification was simply a change “on the books” to reflect that.

        Under this section, the Department of Personnel has authority to regulate various forms of employee benefits, including annual leave and sick leave. Moreover, the regulations that the Department of Personnel may promulgate are subject to a legislative review.

        Since the state is not legally obligated to grant unconditional annual leave as a benefit, it follows that the Department of Personnel may define the terms under which benefits may vest.

        It is legally permissible for the Commonwealth to determine by regulation that annual leave may not be converted to terminal wages and salary until 14-days notice of resignation is given. It is also permissible for the Commonwealth to determine that in order to qualify the employee must not have been terminated for misconduct or for poor work performance.

        Because their jobs were abolished under KRS 156.016, a part of the Kentucky Education Reform Act, employees of the Kentucky Department of Education, dismissed from their jobs, rehired, and subsequently terminated, were not “reinstated” or “reemployed” and were therefore under “initial probation” and not “promotional probation” when they were discharged and did not have the right to an appeal before the Personnel Board.

        A strict interpretation of the statutory definition of Federally-Funded Time-Limited (FFTL) positions is correct; namely, that FFTL positions are limited to those positions for which the federal government has granted funds 1) to provide public employment for under-employed or non-employed persons, or 2) for special or research projects that have a limited life.

        Applicable law provides a three-step analysis for an employee’s rights upon termination from an unclassified position: (1) upon termination of a career employee from the unclassified service, the agency shall determine whether a vacancy exists in a position that the career employee has previously held status in the classified service; (2) if a vacancy exists in a position in the classified service, the agency shall revert the employee to that position; and (3) if a vacancy does not exist in a position that the career employee had previously attained status in the classified service, the agency shall follow the reemployment lists for any positions for which he is qualified.

        Employee who was terminated without cause from a non-merit system position in the Kentucky Department of Parks retained reversion rights due to his prior service with the state classified service employment; those reversion rights required a three-step process: (1) upon termination of the career employee from the unclassified service, the appointing authority had to determine whether a vacancy existed in a position in the last class that the career employee had previously attained status within the classified service; (2) if a vacancy existed in that last class, the agency had to revert the employee to a position in that class; however (3) since a vacancy did not exist in the last class, the appointing authority was required only to consider the terminated employee for re-employment in any vacant position for which he was qualified, as specified by KRS

        Individual lacked standing to assert a claim that KRS 18A.140(1) chilled his First Amendment free speech rights by preventing him from recommending candidates for state employment on political grounds where KRS 18A.140(1) did not subject the individual to indictment for simply recommending individuals for employment because mere recommendation was very different than appointing, promoting, demoting, or dismissing someone based on political affiliation. The fact that one of the individual’s letters was subject to a subpoena in an ongoing merit system investigation did not lead to the conclusion that he would be indicted, the newspaper articles and statements contained therein did not establish that the individual would be indicted, and as a result, the individual had failed to establish specific present objective harm or threat of specific future harm.

        Organization, whose activity and purpose is to aid employees in appealing their assignments of classification under the new state personnel system, could be utilized to represent employees to obtain and protect their economic perquisites, as long as it does not become integrated into being a part of a partisan political campaign or activity.

        Subsection (4) of this section clearly permits a merit employee to become a candidate for a school district office and at the same time hold that office, if elected, since such office is filled on a nonpartisan basis and the compensation is on a per diem basis.

        State merit employees may voluntarily attend a county political party convention and vote for their choice of delegates to the state congressional convention, without jeopardizing their merit positions under the terms of subsection (4) of this section.

        Merit system employees are forbidden to participate in political campaigns, and a school board race qualifies as a political campaign; the only exception is that merit system employees may themselves be candidates for a school board race, and there is no exception that would be applicable to participation in another person’s campaign.

        Contributions of labor or services by a classified employee toward a political campaign, are prohibited by subsection (4) of this section. Moreover, depending on the facts and circumstances, the behavior might constitute a violation of subsection (3) of this section.

        Regarding an employee’s right to be a candidate, the provisions of subsection (4) of this section are not limited to political campaigns; the statute says that a merit employee may not be candidate for nomination to any paid public office and this provision is suffiently clear to prevent a merit employee from running for any office other than those offices specifically mentioned in the statute.

        Subsection (4) of this section is intended to serve the same purpose as the federal Hatch Act and federal interpretations of that Act should be consulted in consulting corresponding portions of the Kentucky statute.

        Subsection (4) of this section prohibits merit employees from engaging in partisan political activity as part of the concerted effort of an organized political party and from becoming candidates in any office for which compensation is paid; however, the statute does not prohibit other activity such as support for nonpartisan candidates and management of groups such as United We Stand America.

       While the General Assembly could authorize the earning of annual and sick leave days in advance as part of the emoluments of service in the General Assembly, to grant sick leave after the fact of serving time would be a grant of exclusive public emoluments in violation of Const., § 3. Therefore, the correct interpretation of this section is that General Assembly time may be included in determining total length of service for purposes of figuring the 1 day, 1 1/4 days, 1 1/2 days, or 1 3/4 days of annual leave earned per month for those persons eligible to earn and now earning annual leave, but members of the General Assembly do not earn annual or sick leave while they are in such positions.

        Any modifications or amendments to a competitively bid contract must be made by the Executive Branch pursuant to KRS Chapter 45A, unless such requirements are superseded by suspension of the procurement statutes by the General Assembly or declaration of a state of emergency by the Governor. Termination of a contract for convenience has as its central purpose the avoidance of payment of future anticipated profits by the Commonwealth. Termination of a contract for cause may be appropriate where a contract fails to meet the minimum standards imposed by statute.

Citizens desiring to purchase coverage shall do so through the office of the Cabinet for Human Resources in the county of the citizen’s residence.

       Each health insurer’s proportion of participation in the state employee health plan shall be determined annually by the Kentucky Health Policy Board based on annual statements and other reports deemed necessary by the board and filed by the insurer with the board. The proportion of participation shall be determined by multiplying the total cost of each state health insurance plan coverage operation by a fraction, the numerator of which equals that insurer’s premium and subscriber contract charges for health insurance written in the state during the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which equals the total of all premiums and subscriber contract charges written in the state.

       The Kentucky Health Policy Board may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of an insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. If an assessment against an insurer is abated or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section.

      2021 Ky. Acts ch. 102 and repealed, reenacted, and amended by
      2021 Ky. Acts ch. 111. The amendments do not appear to be in conflict and have been codified together.

     <p>
      (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky. Acts ch. 107), did not comply with the three-readings rule of Kentucky Constitution Section 46 and that the legislation is, therefore, constitutionally invalid and declared void. That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.

      (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky. Acts ch. 107), did not comply with the three-readings rule of Kentucky Constitution Section 46 and that the legislation is, therefore, constitutionally invalid and declared void. This statute was created in Section 82 of that Act.

        For the purpose of calculating the annual increment due state employees who served more than 12 months in the last step in their grade, their gross annual salary or wages for the year before the enactment of this section shall be carried forward as their gross annual salary or wages for computation of the increment due in the first year under this section.
