       Persons in jail who have been convicted of misdemeanors may register to vote by mail and may vote by absentee ballot. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-135</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no statutory provisions for taking persons from jail either to register or vote or for election officials to go to the jail with registration forms or election ballots. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-135</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A registered voter who moves from one precinct in the county to another more than 30 days before the election but fails to notify the county clerk of his change of residence until after the registration books have closed cannot vote in his new precinct, although he may attempt to vote in his old precinct, assuming his name has not been purged and remains on the registration list when sent to the precinct. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-622</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Persons incarcerated in jail but not yet convicted of any crime are entitled to register to vote, and after they have been duly registered and presumably qualified to vote they may then make application for an absentee ballot. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-202</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who were registered as 17-year-olds, but who would be 18 by the November general election will not be eligible to vote in a special local option election to be held the preceding March. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-41</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city annexing a university area could not strengthen the voting requirements since the voting qualifications are controlled by the Constitution and state statutes. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-157</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only those persons who can qualify to vote may register to vote, which excludes any person who has been convicted of a felony and incarcerated in prison; as a consequence, if the recipients of certain requested voter registration applications are to be convicted felons incarcerated in prison, the county court clerk can legally refuse to comply with the request since the applicants would not be entitled to register and vote. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-411</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though a voter’s registration form may be illegally filled in, insofar as party preference is concerned, when it is submitted to the clerk with the required information contained therein, the clerk would be required to accept it as a valid registration and the voter in question would be considered legally registered and entitled to vote. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-131</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person whose party affiliation was designated on the registration card without his knowledge or consent could only vote and seek office in the succeeding party primary as a member of that party and would be disqualified as to the other party primary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-131</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Party affiliation is of no consequence insofar as one’s voting rights are concerned at the November election. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-131</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person is qualified to vote provided he meets the constitutional qualifications enumerated under Ky. Const., § 145 as modified by the Supreme Court of the United States and as reflected in this section and the registration requirement found in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc116s116.045" target="_self">KRS 116.045</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-131</cite>.

        Under law which provided for one registration day in October of each year, and required a special registration before a special election to enable persons not previously registered to register for the special election, failure of county judge to make provision for special registration preceding local option election invalidated election.

       Registration forms can be accepted for registration purposes only during the period that the registration books are legally open, but distribution of blank forms is not restricted to a particular time or period during the year. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-742</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing under this section governs or restricts the manner of distributing the blank registration forms after they have been obtained from the clerk’s office pursuant to subsection (6) of this section, but the method of registration, outside of the clerk’s office or branch offices, must be approved by the State board as provided in subsection (4)(d) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-570</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A change of political affiliation by a qualified voter is of no legal consequence with respect to his right to participate in any special or general election, which simply means that though a voter may be disqualified in the May primary from voting, he is not disqualified from participating in any special election. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-79</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc116s116.055" target="_self">KRS 116.055</a></cite> are not in conflict with each other with respect to the time at which a voter may change party affiliation without being disfranchised in the primary or general election, since this section provides for qualifications which a voter possesses or will possess on the day of the next regular election and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc116s116.055" target="_self">KRS 116.055</a></cite> governs voting in a primary election, which is not an election under the Kentucky Constitution but is merely a nominating procedure for the major parties. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-113</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The authorization provided in this section for local distribution by the county clerk of blank voter registration cards to any individual or groups of individuals, would include the right of an individual who is running for political office to obtain a reasonable number of the registration cards, with the number to be determined by the clerk. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-255</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only those persons who can qualify to vote may register to vote, which excludes any person who has been convicted of a felony and incarcerated in prison; as a consequence, if the recipients of certain requested voter registration applications are to be convicted felons incarcerated in prison, the county court clerk can legally refuse to comply with the request since the applicants would not be entitled to register and vote. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-411</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person is qualified to vote provided he meets the constitutional qualifications enumerated under Const., § 145 as modified by the Supreme Court of the United States and as reflected in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc116s116.025" target="_self">KRS 116.025</a></cite> and the registration requirement found in this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-131</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A voter is not registered until the county clerk actually makes the entry in the voter registration roll. If the petitioner’s registration had not been recorded by the clerk when the petition was signed, the signature cannot be counted. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-132</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acts 1994, Ch. 393, legislation enacting the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 will take effect on January 1, 1995, the date the National Voter Registration Act will take effect with respect to Kentucky. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 94-42</cite>.

       Since this section requires that a voter, to be qualified to vote in a party primary, must have been registered as a member of that party at the time of the preceding general election, a voter registered as an independent may not qualify to vote in a May party primary by changing his registration unless such change is made before the preceding November election; this type of restriction has been held constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in a number of cases, including Rosario v.

       The provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc116s116.045" target="_self">KRS 116.045</a></cite> and this section are not in conflict with each other with respect to the time at which a voter may change party affiliation without being disfranchised in the primary or general election, since <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc116s116.045" target="_self">KRS 116.045</a></cite> provides for qualifications which a voter possesses or will possess on the day of the next regular election and this section governs voting in a primary election, which is not an election under the Kentucky Constitution but rather merely a nominating procedure for the major parties. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-113</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where one of the electors executing an affidavit on behalf of a candidate changed his party affiliation subsequent to the last November election, he is disqualified as a qualified elector for the primary election, since he must not only have been affiliated with the candidate’s party at the last November election but must also remain so affiliated under this section; thus, the candidate in question should withdraw his filing papers and execute one that complies with the statutory requirement since his papers are defective, but he may, upon notification under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.165" target="_self">KRS 118.165</a></cite> correct such error not later than 72 hours after the filing deadline; otherwise his name shall not be placed on the ballot. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-126</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an individual changed his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican subsequent to the 1984 November election, he was disqualified from becoming a candidate in the May primary for either party; he could, however, change his registration back to that of Democrat and be qualified to seek nomination as a member of that party, or he could run as an independent. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-42</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A candidate is eligible to run in the 1993 primary if he changed his party affiliation after the November 1992 election, and then switched back to his original party affiliation before filing to run in the primary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 93-8</cite>.

       A person whose party affiliation was designated on the registration card without his knowledge or consent could only vote and seek office in the succeeding party primary as a member of that party and would be disqualified as to the other party primary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-131</cite>.

      <p>
       The use of a computer to perform the normal function
    of the county board with respect to the tabulation of votes by hand should
    be authorized by the State Board of Elections, since said board has the over-all
    supervision and administration of the election laws of the state; but if the
    plan was to have the county board tabulate the votes in the normal manner
    and, at the same time, supervise the feeding of the vote tally into the computer
    to determine, in effect, which method proves to be the quickest and most accurate,
    there should be no legal objection. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-229</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of any specific statute concerning
    the length of time old registration records are to be retained by a local
    board, the state board of elections would be authorized to adopt a regulation
    fixing a time after which such records may be destroyed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-64</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those members of the State Board of Elections who
    were appointed by members of the General Assembly, whose appointments the
    Supreme Court held to be invalid, continue to serve as de facto officers until
    they either resign or are removed individually or collectively; however, they
    are not entitled to receive any compensation for duties imposed upon and performed
    by them by virtue of the office, nor can they forcibly require the payment
    of such compensation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-212</cite>.

     Declaration
     by state board of county’s status as a preclearance county.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The State Board of Elections
    may declare a county to be a preclearance county for election purposes when
    that county has a history of voter fraud, noncompliance with election laws,
    or voter complaints about the integrity of a particular election. In a county
    designated as a preclearance county, all decisions of the county board of
    elections shall be reported to the State Board of Elections for its review.
    The failure of a county board of elections of a preclearance county to submit
    its decisions to the State Board of Elections for its review shall constitute
    a prima facie case for appointment of an election manager under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc117s117.022" target="_self">KRS 117.022</a></cite>.
    The State Board of Elections may require a preclearance county to submit evidence
    or justification as required by the state board which is necessary to evaluate
    the county board’s decisions. A county designated as a preclearance county
    shall retain that designation until it is removed by the State Board of Elections.

     <p>
      The Attorney General, the Secretary
    of State, and the State Board of Elections, by mutual agreement, may petition
    Franklin Circuit Court to declare that an election crisis exists in a county
    where there is evidence of sufficient malfeasance, nonfeasance, or criminal
    activity to jeopardize a free and equal election in that county and to authorize
    the State Board of Elections to assume responsibility for the management of
    the election in that county. If Franklin Circuit Court makes that declaration
    and grant of authority, the State Board of Elections shall appoint an election
    manager for that county to serve for the duration of the election cycle and
    the county clerk, county board of elections, precinct election officers, and
    any other person participating in the election process in that county shall
    be subject to the direction of the election manager.

    Where a publisher did not show that it would have suffered harm other than financial harm, and did not show a likelihood of success on the merits of its suit to obtain rosters of registered voters, the district court properly denied its motion for a preliminary injunction.

       In the absence of any specific statute concerning
    the length of time old registration records are to be retained by a local
    board, the State Board of Elections would be authorized to adopt a regulation
    fixing a time after which such records may be destroyed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-64</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section merely mandates that the State Board
    of Elections shall put into precinct list form all of the registered voters
    of the state and make those lists available to candidates and other persons;
    there are no restrictive words except to the effect that the precinct list
    shall not be used for commercial purposes. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-77</cite>.

      <p>
       The phrase “ . . . . .
    employ, on a bipartisan basis
    . . . . . ” as used in subsection (2) of this section simply
    means that the board should employ its personnel on the basis of their qualifications,
    experience, etc., irrespective of the individual’s party affiliation, so long
    as both major parties are represented on the board’s staff, as is the case
    with the board itself. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-656</cite>.

      <p>
       For a member of the State Board of Elections to either
    participate in the discussion of the applicants for the position of executive
    director or to cast a vote in filling the position, for which said member
    is a candidate, would create a common-law conflict of interest as being against
    public policy and self-serving. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-16</cite>.

       The decision of the Commonwealth Board of Elections
    to deny the request for copies of precinct lists and mailing labels in connection
    with mailing the letter in question was supported by the provisions of subdivision

The County Clerk should copy the voter assistance forms to which the requester requested access and permit him to inspect those copies after redacting the social security numbers appearing thereon.

        Pendency of proceedings before state central committee
    of party to settle controversy between contending county committees did not
    deprive courts of right to compel state board to perform duties. Russell v. Rhea, 269 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 138</cite>, 106 S.W.2d 148, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 565</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior

       <p>
        When a county executive committee entitled to designate
    a list of names does so, the state board has no right to ignore the list or
    to question the proceedings pursuant to which the list was selected. It must
    accept the list as valid. Howard v. Stevenson, 269 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 491</cite>, 107 S.W.2d 304, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 618</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The list of names must be designated by the county
    executive committee as a body. A designation by the chairman of the county
    committee is of no effect, although the chairman may act as the agent of the
    committee in certifying the list the committee has selected. Murray v. Gill, 269 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 207</cite>, 106 S.W.2d 634, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 575</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior law).

    right to declare the list illegal on the ground of irregularity in the proceedings
    of the county committee pursuant to which the list was selected, or to ignore
    the list and appoint some other person. Where that was done, the state board
    could be compelled to reconvene and make a new appointment from the list. Russell v. Rhea, 269 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 138</cite>, 106 S.W.2d 148, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 565</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior

        The state board may meet and make appointments at

    and is not required to recognize list submitted during August but after the

       Since the offices of employee of the state highway

       There is no legal objection to a board member serving

       Inasmuch as two members of the county board of elections

       Since announcement for a public office is not made
    until after January 1 in the calendar year of the election, while election
    officers for precincts are selected by the previous September 20 in the preceding

       When the sheriff is a candidate for another public
    office he cannot serve as a member of the county board of elections and a

       The fiscal court is required to pay election board

       There is no question that the fiscal court can from
    time to time alter the compensation of members of the county board of elections
    (the only restriction being that it cannot go below $15.00 per meeting) since
    members of the commission are not constitutionally named officers whose compensation
    cannot be changed during their term, but where the fiscal court initially
    fixed the compensation at $24.00 per meeting, which remained unchanged from
    1976 through the 1978 election, it could not enter a subsequent order reducing
    the compensation already earned by the commissioners by making the order retroactive,

       Although any change in a precinct boundary must be

      </p>
      <p>
       Since there is no publication requirement of any such
    actions taken by the board before they become effective, the board can call
    a meeting at any time that it deems necessary to make a proposed boundary
    change, and after making the change and upon recording same in its records,
    such change would become effective. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-609</cite>.

      <p>
       An individual holding the office of magistrate can
    at the same time serve on the county board of elections, since no constitutional
    or statutory provisions prohibit a person from holding two county offices

    another county office to serve on the county board of elections. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-263</cite>.

      <p>
       The employment of a staff by a county board of election
    pursuant to subsection (5) of this section must be interpreted as discretionary
    by the board; an interpretation that the subsection is mandatory would violate
    the separate powers doctrine contained in Const., § 27 and Const.,
    § 28 because the legislature would have statutorily predetermined
    the necessity for a staff, which determination is an administrative function
    which is normally delegated to the agency in question. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-102</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (5) of this section is directory insofar
    as requiring the board to employ a supporting staff but mandatory that if
    a staff is needed, it be selected on a nonpartisan basis. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-102</cite>.

       Action of county board of elections authorizing the

    terminate employees, authority to direct the day to day operations of said
    board and its staff, authority to purchase any necessary supplies and equipment,
    and authority to act as the principal spokesperson of said board and its staff,
    was an impermissible delegation of responsibility as the responsibility for
    the employment of personnel is the responsibility of the entire board; moreover,
    since subsection (3) of this section provides that the county clerk shall
    serve as chairman of the meetings and may vote, but does not authorize the
    clerk to assume any other responsibilities for the operations of county boards
    of election, the additional functions delegated by the board would remain

       Although the board, if possible, should avoid splitting
    magisterial district lines, it is not required to do so and may combine two
    precincts in different magisterial districts into one precinct where necessary
    to comply with the terms of this section regarding voter distribution. OAG
    74-544; modified by <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-126</cite>.

    line of a justice district shall cross the boundary line of an election precinct

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a school division line bisects a precinct, the
    county board of elections and the school board should work together in determining
    the actual location of the eligible voters in each school division who will
    be voting in a particular precinct and the school board should assist the
    clerk by furnishing him with such a breakdown since the school board is in
    a better position to know the location of the school boundary lines and the
    board should also furnish the clerk with a map showing the school boundary
    lines so that the clerk can, in turn, determine in which school division within
    the split precinct the voters reside and thereby mark the registration list
    that goes to the precinct in such a manner as to enable the election officers
    to set the machine correctly before each voter proceeds to vote. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-367</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A change in precinct boundaries and the reapportionment
    of magisterial districts are in no way connected in point of time and, as
    a consequence, there is no requirement that one be initiated before the other.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-745</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where precinct lines coincide a single voting place
    may be established in one place to permit the voters in both precincts to
    vote at the same place. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-43</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the 1976 amendment to this section and
    the requirement that magisterial district lines shall not bisect precinct
    lines found under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc25s25.700" target="_blank">KRS 25.700</a></cite> (repealed), the reapportionment commissioners
    and the county board of elections should make a concerted effort to see that
    precinct boundary lines and magisterial boundary lines comply with the respective
    statutes and due to the fact that the magisterial boundary lines must comply
    with the equal population factor under the “one man, one vote”
    rule it would be easier for the county board of elections to change the precinct
    lines so as to coincide with the magisterial district lines after the county
    has been reapportioned. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-126</cite>, modifying <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-544</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section would permit only one voting place in
    any one precinct, though such voting place could be utilized by a number of
    precincts where it is located on or near joining precinct lines. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-554</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county board, in its discretion, may create a new
    voting precinct composed of an annexed territory where it deems necessary
    to do so, so long as it is done not less than 55 days before the May primary.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-99</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is mandatory for the county board of elections
    to review the boundaries of a precinct exceeding 700 voters, but the county
    board of elections may give permission to exceed 700 voters in a registered
    precinct and still be within the law. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-298</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county election board may relocate a precinct county
    line, so as to place a country club entirely within one “wet”
    precinct before a local option election is held in a second precinct containing
    half the club where the change would be wholly within the boundary of one
    magisterial or commissioners’ district and would not affect the precinct location
    of any voter. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-609</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       No precinct boundary line can cross a magisterial
    boundary line which is the political territory having the less area within
    the county’s boundaries with the exception of municipal boundaries. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-609</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       After reapportionment involving changes from the prior
    reapportionment, it is the responsibility of the county board of elections
    to so draw or redraw precinct boundary lines so that no precinct line bisects
    or crosses a magisterial line, as last established under reapportionment,
    but the precinct lines are irrelevant as concerns reapportionment itself.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-69</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1980 Legislature amended this section to change
    the method of determining the size of the precincts by eliminating the requirement
    that it be based on the number of registered voters and providing in its place
    that it shall be determined by the number of votes cast at the last regular
    election. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-378</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The size of election precincts must be based on the
    number of votes cast at the last regular election rather than the number of
    registered voters within the precinct. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-527</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The establishment of magisterial districts is done
    by the work of the commissioners of reapportionment as finally treated by
    fiscal court ordinance. The coordination of precinct boundaries with magisterial
    districts is the separate burden of the county board of elections under this
    section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-451</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A location of one voting place in a city to serve
    several adjacent precincts would be perfectly proper so long as the actual
    voting would be held in separate rooms for each precinct. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-511</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a new districting plan included a city plus
    some additional area within the magisterial district, since the city could
    divide its area into a number of precincts, the board could establish one
    voting place at the courthouse or any other location that was reasonably close
    to the precinct lines where the voters of all such precints could vote. OAG
    82-511.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a fiscal court adopts a plan for reapportionment
    of magisterial districts that meets the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.045" target="_blank">KRS 67.045</a></cite>, yet divides
    one or more voting precincts, since both the reapportionment act, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.045" target="_blank">KRS 67.045</a></cite>,
    and this section, prohibit a precinct line from bisecting or crossing a magisterial
    district line and particularly following reapportionment as required by <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.045" target="_blank">KRS 67.045</a></cite>, following reapportionment the county board of elections must alter
    any precinct that has been crossed by virtue of reapportionment in order to
    conform with the requirements of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.045" target="_blank">KRS 67.045</a></cite> and this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-617</cite>;
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-621</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section prohibits the fiscal court from changing
    the present precinct boundary lines until the Kentucky General Assembly has
    enacted redistricting legislation; the county board of elections has the exclusive
    authority to alter precinct boundaries rather than the fiscal court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-55</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the written description with regard to precinct
    boundaries did not correspond with the precinct map, the map is the primary
    document with regard to precinct boundaries. However, if there is a serious
    discrepancy this would be a factual question which this office cannot answer
    and which would require a determination by the court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-55</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, lines are to be drawn by the county
    board of elections and the reapportionment commission has no authority to
    establish a precinct boundary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-58</cite>.

       Since the requirement that schools not be opened without
    a custodian is a policy created by school board and not by statute, the circumstances
    surrounding the use of schools as voting places as provided for in subsection
    (2) of this section may be structured so that there does not exist any unwarranted

       This section requires the county board of elections
    to establish a voting place “for” each precinct; although this
    section previously used the word “in” instead of “for”
    it would still appear that the voting place established for a particular precinct
    should be located therein if at all possible; however, the county board may
    draw precinct lines so as to enable more than one precinct to vote at one
    particular location so that a voting place may be established in an adjacent
    precinct that is on or near the adjoining precinct line thereby serving two
    precincts. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-698</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A location of one voting place in a city to serve
    several adjacent precincts would be perfectly proper so long as the actual
    voting would be held in separate rooms for each precinct. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-511</cite>.

      <p>
       Where a new districting plan included a city plus
    some additional area within the magisterial district, since the city could
    divide its area into a number of precincts, the board could establish one
    voting place at the courthouse or any other location that was reasonably close

      <p>
       The application for an absentee ballot must be considered
    as having been made when properly mailed and the actual receipt by the clerk
    within the specified time is not required. Queenan v. Russell, 339 S.W.2d 475, 1960 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 469</cite> (Ky. 1960) (decided under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Former sections governing applications for absentee
    ballots imposed no duty upon a notary public to administer an oath or to notarize
    an application for an absentee ballot. Redden v. Commonwealth, 339 S.W.2d 447, 1960 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 452</cite> (Ky. 1960) (decided under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was substantial compliance with posting requirement
    where the list was publicly available on the counter in the county clerk’s
    office. Arnett v. Hensley, 425 S.W.2d 546, 1968 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 418</cite> (Ky. 1968) (decided
    under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Merely furnishing a list to the officers present
    at the polling places did not satisfy the posting requirements of former section. Arnett v. Hensley, 425 S.W.2d 546, 1968 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 418</cite> (Ky. 1968) (decided under prior
    law).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the trial court’s finding that a clear majority of the walk-in absentee votes cast in one district were tainted because (1) improper addresses were provided; (2) persons obtaining absentee ballots were actually in the county on election day; and (3) voters not entitled to assistance with voting machines under Kentucky law obtained such assistance. McClendon v. Hodges, 272 S.W.3d 188, 2008 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 257</cite> (Ky. 2008).

        1.Voiding Elections.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Election was declared void because (1) a county board of elections did not substantially comply with absentee ballot counting requirements, (2) there were repeated Corrupt Practices Act violations and misconduct during voting on election day, and (3) cumulative departures from statutory mandates disfranchised legal voters or those who cast valid absentee ballots.
    Hardin v. Montgomery, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 94</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. June 12, 2015) (Ct. App. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2016</cite>).

       <p>
        Alleged irregularities relating to the in-house absentee process did not justify nullifying an election for judge executive where
    Ky Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc117s117.085" target="_self">117.085(</a></cite>1)(h) disclosed no requirement for each board member to be present at the in-house voting site, and the four occasion in which a deputy county clerk or Democrat election commissioner assisted voters with no one else present were not so widespread as to invalidate the entire absentee balloting process under the Ragan-Warren standard.

       <p>
        Election officials' failure to obtain the voter's telephone number and social security number did not render the absentee voter application invalid or illegal where
    Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc117s117.085" target="_self">117.085(</a></cite>2) did not direct the clerk or the election officials to obtain that information, no other law so provide, and the name and address of the voter on the application provided adequate identifying information.
    Hardin v. Montgomery, 495 S.W.3d 686, 2016 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 332</cite> (Ky. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a federal prosecution of a deputy clerk for participation in a vote buying conspiracy, the jury was incorrectly told that Kentucky law prohibited the clerk from supervising in-person absentee voting; because a challenger is not an election officer, a challenger’s presence did not result in equal representation of political parties, and the clerk’s supervision was proper. The error was not prejudicial because the jury was correctly instructed that the clerk could not lawfully assist voters. United States v. Risner, 737 Fed. Appx. 751, 2018 FED App. 0304N, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 16252 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2018</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where two entirely separate elections were to take
    place on the same day, since the Legislature has failed to provide a method
    of procedure for printing and issuing ballots for such combined elections,
    it would be deemed in the best interests of all concerned to have a separate
    ballot printed for each of such elections, and sent separately by the county
    clerk, to those who properly applied for an absent voter’s ballot. Martin v. Moore, 306 S.W.2d 98, 1957 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 18</cite> (Ky. 1957) (decided under prior
    law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Kentucky statutes that prohibited disclosing names and temporary addresses of absentee voters prior to election, did not infringe upon candidates' free speech rights because First Amendment does not require government to disclose information to candidates in order to facilitate their campaign efforts. Sheldon v. Grimes, 18 F. Supp. 3d 854, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60518 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2014</cite>).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Since this section provides that the clerk shall retain
    the absent voters’ applications until 30 days (now 22 months) after the election,
    the clerk should not turn over the applications to the state police before
    the expiration of the 30-day period (now 22 months) unless he is presented
    with a court order directing him to do so. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-727</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the voter furnishes sufficient identification on
    the telephone to the satisfaction of the clerk, such method of making application
    for the form would be legal under the terms of the statute. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-424</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision in this section that the voter may make
    application to the clerk in person or by mail for an absentee ballot can only
    refer to the return of the application form, properly filled out by the voter,
    to the clerk for his absentee ballot, and could not be construed to refer
    to obtaining the application form by the voter for future submission back
    to the clerk for his absentee ballot. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-424</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county clerk cannot hand deliver any absent voter’s
    ballot but must mail all such ballots to the voter. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-311</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A voter who desires to vote absentee could, pursuant
    to this section, request an application form for an absent ballot from the
    clerk by telephone, provided the clerk could properly identify the voter.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-416</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the clerk’s seal was inadvertently left off
    the application form and there was ample evidence that the form was in fact
    sent to the voter from the clerk’s office and received from the voter properly
    filled out and signed, the statutory requirement of this section has been
    substantially complied with; therefore, the application form sent to and returned
    by the voter would be valid. Added weight to this conclusion is the fact that
    the voter has complied with the statutory requirements imposed on him in making
    application and returning same and should not be penalized for an error committed
    on the part of the clerk or one of his deputies. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-436</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absentee ballots and applications which were in the
    custody of the circuit clerk pending an election contest suit were “public
    records” in the possession of a “public agency” pursuant
    to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.870" target="_blank">KRS 61.870</a></cite> and open to public inspection while in the clerk’s custody.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-476</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there is no specific statute under the election
    laws declaring that a voter’s application for an absentee ballot required
    to be made under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc117s117.075" target="_self">KRS 117.075</a></cite> or this section becomes a public record open
    to public inspection, the completed application constitutes a public record
    to which the county clerk cannot deny access. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-166</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since subsection (4) (now (5)) of this section which
    requires county clerks to have election ballots printed 50 days before the
    election and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc83As83A.045" target="_blank">KRS 83A.045</a></cite> under certain conditions allows candidates for city
    offices in certain small cities to file for office up to 30 days before election,
    are patent and irreconcilable, county clerks should proceed with the printing
    of the ballots as required by subsection (4) (now (5)) of this section even
    though there is still time for some candidates to file for certain city offices;
    if a candidate later files for one (1) of the city races, the clerk may reprint
    the ballots for the precincts within the affected city. With regard to city
    voters who may receive an absentee ballot while the filing period is still
    open, the situation should be disclosed to them by attaching a notice to the
    absentee ballot so that they may choose to withhold voting until all the candidates
    are known. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 93-62</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section permits all students who live outside
    the county in which they are registered to vote by paper absentee ballot.

      <p>
       Legislation providing for “no-excuse absentee voting,” or early voting, in order to comply with federal law, a final court decision binding the Commonwealth, or rights recognized in the Bill of Rights of the Kentucky Constitution would not require an amendment to the Kentucky Constitution. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 07-05</cite>.

        Under former similar section, it seemed that the
    absentee ballots should be tabulated before canvassing the votes cast at the
    polls. Arnett v. Hensley, 425 S.W.2d 546, 1968 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 418</cite> (Ky. 1968) (decided

        2.Individual Challenges.

       <p>
        Former section governing challenges to absent voters
    envisioned challenges to individual absentee voters, not challenges to the
    legality of the entire balloting by absentee voters in which case such challenges
    were inapplicable. Arnett v. Hensley, 425 S.W.2d 546, 1968 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 418</cite> (Ky. 1968) (decided under prior law).

        3.Inner Envelopes.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where integrity and secrecy of absentee ballots were
    proved, the failure to return the inner envelopes to the ballot box before
    opening and counting the votes would not require the elimination in toto of
    all absentee ballots. Rives v. Pettit, 513 S.W.2d 475, 1974 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 371</cite> (Ky. 1974) (decided under prior law).

        4.Substantial Compliance.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Alleged irregularities in the absentee voting process were insufficient to nullify the election results in a race for judge executive where each of the alleged violations concerned directory, rather than mandatory, requirements, and, as such, did not warrant disenfranchising any of the absentee voters. Hardin v. Montgomery, 495 S.W.3d 686, 2016 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 332</cite> (Ky. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        There should be at least substantial compliance with
    the terms of former similar section. Kincer v. Holbrook, 307 S.W.2d 922, 1957 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 124</cite> (Ky. 1957) (decided under prior law).

       </h5>
       <p>
        If the separable class of absentee votes is so infected
    with illegality that the elective force of those votes cannot reasonably be
    determined, then all of them are nullified. Ragan v. Burnett, 305 S.W.2d 759, 1957 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 330</cite> (Ky. 1957) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Violation of various provisions governing absentee
    ballots with violations of other provisions and discrepancy in ratio of result
    of votes cast at polls and the absentee votes, was sufficient to show such
    gross irregularities as to void all absentee ballots. Arnett v. Hensley, 425 S.W.2d 546, 1968 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 418</cite> (Ky. 1968) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Election was declared void because (1) a county board of elections did not substantially comply with absentee ballot counting requirements, (2) there were repeated Corrupt Practices Act violations and misconduct during voting on election day, and (3) cumulative departures from statutory mandates disfranchised legal voters or those who cast valid absentee ballots.
    Hardin v. Montgomery, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 94</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. June 12, 2015) (Ct. App. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2016</cite>).

        Where absentee ballot box was prepared by sheriff,
    Democrat commissioner and county clerk in absence of Republican commissioner
    who favored the contestant, and the key was not delivered to the absent member
    until three days before the election, after many of the absentee ballots had
    been returned, the procedure violated former similar section but standing

       Where, due to a multiplicity of city elections filed
    for in a single election year within a county, the county has an insufficient

       Although a county court clerk is not required to print
    a number of special paper ballots equal to any specified percentage of the
    registered voters within the county, the clerk’s judgment on this matter should
    be based on the number of registered voters in the county, while taking into
    consideration the amount needed in previous elections. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-213</cite>.
      </p>

       There is no requirement that the words “absent”
    or “special” be printed on ballots mailed to absentee and disabled

      Before the polls are open, and before permitting any person to vote on the day of the election, the election officers shall examine the voting equipment to ascertain whether it has been operated since the counters referred to in subsections (17) and (18) of Section 18 of this Act were set at zero, and to ascertain whether the ballots are arranged as previously specified. If the voting equipment indicates that it has been operated or if the ballots are not properly arranged, the officers shall not unlock the operating device or mechanism, but shall immediately secure the attendance of the county clerk and one (1) member of the county board of elections other than the county clerk, who shall reset the counters at zero and relock the device covering the counters, or properly arrange the ballots, as the case may be, in the presence of the election officers. If the attendance of members of the board of elections cannot be obtained before the opening of the polls or within one (1) hour thereafter, the election officers shall notify the county clerk of the foregoing facts and obtain from the county clerk reserve voting equipment, and proceed to conduct the election. Any reserve voting equipment shall have been certified for use at the election by the county board of elections and prepared for use at the election by the election officers in the precinct in the same manner as the original voting equipment was prepared for the election. The voting equipment found to have been so operated shall be returned immediately to the custody of the county clerk, whose duty it shall be to promptly repair same so that it may be used as reserve voting equipment in the election if needed.

      <p>
       Where, due to a multiplicity of city elections filed
    for in a single election year within a county, the county has an insufficient
    number of voting machines, the county board of elections and the county clerk
    may determine that an emergency exists authorizing the use of paper ballots.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-610</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no requirement that the words “absent”
    or “special” be printed on ballots mailed to absentee and disabled
    voters; therefore one type of paper ballot can be used both as an absent ballot
    and as an emergency ballot. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-213</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county clerk is not required to have special ballots,
    ballot boxes and booths prepared for each election since a reserve voting
    machine is sufficient under subsection (2) of this section, which clearly
    provides that if an emergency arises due to the malfunction of the voting
    machine, the clerk has the alternative of either providing a backup voting
    machine or special ballots. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-284</cite>.

        Five-hundred (500) foot electioneering
    ban is both necessary and narrowly tailored. Because the restriction is necessary
    and narrowly tailored, and because the ban serves recognized and compelling
    state interests, the restriction survives “strict scrutiny” review.
    In short, Kentucky’s prohibition on electioneering within 500 feet of polling
    stations strikes a constitutionally permissible compromise between the competing

        In a federal prosecution of a deputy clerk for participation in a vote buying conspiracy, the jury was incorrectly told that Kentucky law prohibited the clerk from supervising in-person absentee voting; because a challenger is not an election officer, a challenger’s presence did not result in equal representation of political parties, and the clerk’s supervision was proper. The error was not prejudicial because the jury was correctly instructed that the clerk could not lawfully assist voters.

        It was a violation of law for a Republican judge,
    in handling ballots to voters, to explain how they could vote the straight
    Republican ticket, but in the absence of evidence as to how such voters voted,
    or that contestant was prejudiced thereby, the entire vote of the precinct

       <p>
        Former law which provided that persons other than
    officials or challengers were not permitted in the voting room while vote
    was being polled except for the purpose of voting or by the authority of election
    officials was directory and not mandatory; its purpose was to maintain secrecy
    of the ballot, and if the secrecy of the election was not violated, an election
    would not be set aside because of a technical violation. A general allegation
    that violation of former law changed the result of the election was insufficient
    to show invalidity of election, since it failed to show how and to what extent
    votes were affected. Feld v. Prewitt, 274 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 306</cite>, 118 S.W.2d 700, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 264</cite> (Ky. 1938); Fuson v. Helton, 314 <cite class="ocky"></cite>, 234 S.W.2d 496, 1950 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1038</cite> (Ky. 1950) (decided

        In order to sustain a contest, violation of the 50-foot

    it must have invaded the secrecy of the ballot or have been of such character
    as to constitute intimidation, or otherwise have affected the fairness of
    the election. Adams v. Wakefield, 301 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 35</cite>, 190 S.W.2d 701, 1945 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 687</cite> (Ky. 1945), overruled, Barger v.

        In election contest where it was contended that secrecy
    of ballot was not maintained because persons were permitted to congregate
    within less than 50 feet of the polling place in two precincts, such violation
    did not invalidate election as there was no showing that to any substantial

        In order to establish violations of former section

      </h4>
      <p>
       The phrase “within fifty feet of the polls”
    contained in a former version of subsection (3) of this section meant within
    50 feet of the door to the polling place. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-473</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In counties where the fiscal court or legislative
    body of an urban-county government have not enacted a county wide electioneering
    ordinance, the providing of transportation and the hauling of voters to the
    polls on election day would not themselves constitute actions in violation
    of the statute. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-773</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Challengers may stay within the voting room while
    the vote is being polled, the election judges having no authority to eject
    them therefrom, and the challengers may exercise reasonable discretion in
    deciding where in the room they will post themselves, including withdrawing
    from the voting room when they feel it necessary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-95</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clear that where the courtroom was selected
    as the voting place on election day, no one should have been permitted to
    have access to the room during the period that the polls were open other than
    the election officers, challengers and those persons desiring to cast their
    vote, which would exclude the city judge and members of the police force.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-408</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The posting of political signs and posters in the
    vicinity of the polls does not appear to constitute “electioneering”
    as restricted by this section, but such material should be placed prior to
    the opening of the polls on election day. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-627</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political posters erected before the polls open would
    not constitute a form of electioneering, but during polling hours posters
    cannot be erected in or around the polling place or within the prohibited
    radius established pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-627</cite>,
    77-222.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “electioneering” means where
    a person, through some overt action, tries to sway a voter to vote for a particular
    candidate or public question by persuasion, harassment or intimidation and
    this definition would prevent the handing out of political cards and literature
    at the polling place or within the area outside established by law in which
    electioneering is prohibited. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-222</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political posters cannot be placed on the voting booth
    itself under any circumstances even though erected prior to the opening of
    the polls. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-222</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       People cannot congregate outside of the election booth
    and even the officers and challengers should not in any way interfere with
    the election process by congregating outside of the voting booth; of course,
    one of the judges must be there to operate the machine but the rest of the
    perimeter should be clear of the election officials and challengers. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-222</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       By this section the Legislature did not intend to
    bar electioneering throughout a county but rather to authorize the fiscal
    court to specifically establish a distance from the polling place beyond which
    electioneering may be permitted. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-318</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       By failing to establish a specific distance, beyond
    the minimum of 50 feet contained in a former version of subsection (3) of
    this section prior to amendment, from the polling place where electioneering
    may be permitted (as for example, 50, 100 or 200 feet), this section makes
    it impossible to determine this fact unless the intent is to bar electioneering
    throughout the county; the Legislature could not have intended this, since
    it would not only be unreasonable but also unenforceable. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-425</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The electioneering statute poses a serious question
    as to its validity because of vagueness with respect to the distance from
    the polls, beyond the 50-foot minimum contained in a former version of subsection
    (3) prior to amendment, that electioneering may be permitted where the fiscal
    court or legislative body fails to enact appropriate legislation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-425</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A literal interpretation of subsection (1) of this
    section thwarts certain basic First Amendment rights of the media to gather
    and disseminate news; thus, the media should be allowed to enter the polling
    place for the very limited purpose of filming or observing the electoral process
    for a limited time. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 88-76</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Electioneering, as defined in this section, broadly
    encompasses all activities, including such passive activities as wearing a
    campaign button, that solicit a vote for or against a candidate or issue.
    (overruling <cite class="OAG"> OAG 1984-94</cite>). <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-73</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section may be fully enforced to prohibit electioneering
    by precinct officers, since the state’s compelling need to maintain orderly
    elections outweighs the first amendment rights of the precinct officers, but
    the first amendment prohibits enforcement of this section to prohibit voters
    from wearing items such as buttons or shirts that solicit a vote for or against
    a candidate or issue, although the first amendment does not allow a voter
    to disrupt the voting process by persistent appeals to other voters who do
    not wish to be subjected to such communication; passive communication such
    as wearing a hat, button, or shirt is permissible; oral solicitation of votes,
    or other more intrusive communication, is not. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-73</cite>.

    terms of this section is designed for use where there exists some record of
    the voter having been registered but nevertheless his right to be registered
    has been challenged; but if no registration record exists at the polls, he
    should not be permitted to vote under oath and must seek relief before the
    county board, county court or Circuit Court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-409</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although registration constitutes only prima facie
    evidence of a person’s right to vote and does not prevent the officers of
    any election from refusing to allow him to vote for cause, if his right to
    vote is challenged, the voter may sign a written oath as to his qualifications
    and then be permitted to vote. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-304</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a challenger can observe a voter signing
    the registration record, check the signature and challenge the qualifications
    of the voter, he cannot enter the voting booth to observe the voter casting
    his vote. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-401</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A nonregistered voter would be required to appear
    before the county board on election day for permission to vote or, being refused
    the right, appeal to a Circuit Court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-785</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a voter moves to another precinct but fails to
    notify the clerk to change his registration, he is still prima facie eligible
    to vote in his old precinct until purged by the board pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc116s116.115" target="_self">KRS 116.115</a></cite>
    (repealed); such voter can, of course, be challenged at the polls, however,
    he may execute the voter’s oath and proceed to vote under the terms of this
    section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-466</cite>.

        If an election officer or other person marked the
    ballot of a voter with a pen or pencil, or pointed out on the ballot where
    to stencil it, without the voter having been sworn, the ballot should have

    should place the stencil, or were voted openly on the table, or were not folded
    before being deposited in the box, or were stenciled when an election officer
    was in the booth with the voter, without any voter being sworn, the entire
    vote in such precincts was thrown out. Marilla v. Ratterman, 209 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 409</cite>, 273 S.W. 69, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 513</cite> (Ky. 1925) (decided under prior law).

The error was not prejudicial because the jury was correctly instructed that the clerk could not lawfully assist voters. United States v. Risner, 737 Fed.

      <p>
       No one, including an election officer, is authorized
    to assist a voter by entering the voting booth unless such voter is physically
    disabled and executes an oath to that effect, and any election officer violating
    this section is subject to prosecution under the penalty section of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc117s117.995" target="_self">KRS 117.995</a></cite>.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-91</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section clearly authorizes the disabled voter
    to select a person of his own choice other than the two election judges to
    assist him in voting and precinct challengers would qualify for selection
    by the disabled voter to assist him in voting if he so chooses. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-205</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a disabled voter is refused the assistance provided
    for in this section, he must either refer the matter to the county board of
    elections that is in session on election day or take the matter directly to
    Circuit Court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-269</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a disabled voter chooses one of the election officers
    to assist him, that officer must execute the oath as any other individual
    that the voter might select. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-386</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “disabled” as used in the third
    sentence of subsection (2) prior to amendment included illiterate voters.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-386</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A disabled voter who wishes to cast a “write-in”
    vote could be assisted by one of the judges who, in the presence of the other,
    could write in the candidate’s name designated by the voter. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-404</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) of this section permits a voter to
    be assisted in voting if he signs an oath that by reason of inability to read
    English or by reason of blindness or other physical disability he is unable
    to vote without assistance and, if the disabled voter prefers, he can be assisted
    by a person of his own choice. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-291</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An individual who is unable to read English qualifies
    for assistance in casting his vote in a voting machine, despite the fact that
    he may be to a degree literate and able to understand certain words but is
    unable to read and understand the names of various candidates and the instruction
    in the voting machine, since this fact would not disqualify him from receiving
    assistance in voting as provided in this section; however, it is basically
    not the duty of the election officials to determine the extent of that person’s
    disability, if he is willing to swear or affirm that he possesses such disability.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-180</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the disabled voter and the person assisting him
    may execute the oath by affirmation rather than by swearing. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-632</cite>.

The County Clerk should copy the voter assistance forms to which the requester requested access and permit him to inspect those copies after redacting the social security numbers appearing thereon.

    such person would be counted, but votes for other persons properly on the
    ballot would be counted. Graham v. Graham, 68 S.W. 1093, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 548</cite>, 1902 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 425</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1902) (decided under prior law).

        Where a candidate’s name is printed on the ballot,
    a write-in vote cannot be cast for such candidate. If a voter writes in the
    name of such candidate the ballot will not be counted. Kash v. Hurst, 189 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 233</cite>, 224 S.W. 757, 1920 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 408</cite> (Ky. 1920) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        A person for whom write-in votes have been cast is
    entitled to contest the election of another candidate. Huff v. Black, 259 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 550</cite>, 82 S.W.2d 473, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 326</cite> (Ky. 1935) (decided under prior law).

        A candidate voted for by write-in votes is not ineligible
    to hold office merely because his name was not printed on the general election
    ballot; this is true even when the person voted for was defeated at the preceding
    primary election. Asher v. Arnett, 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 347</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 772, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 87</cite> (Ky. 1939) (decided

       Where a school board member’s resignation is not tendered
    in writing to and accepted by the board prior to 55 days before the general
    election, there is no vacancy and the office need not be placed on the ballot
    until the following election; however, had such a vacancy existed, the office
    would have to be placed on the ballot for the purpose of write-in votes, even
    if no candidates had filed petitions. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-635</cite>.

       A voter may write in a candidate of his own selection
    for judge at the general election pursuant to this section, despite the fact
    that that candidate has not been nominated as required by subsection (1) of
    <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.10.html#tXc118As118A.060" target="_blank">KRS 118A.060</a></cite>, since <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.10.html#tXc118As118A.060" target="_blank">KRS 118A.060</a></cite> does not declare that a person must be nominated

      <p>
       It would be improper for a write-in candidate to use
    a rubber stamp, paster, stencil or other type of marker to have voters write

    the pencil or pen required to be attached to the voting machine by subsection

        It was the duty of the county clerk to retain custody

    was contesting the election of an opponent; but it was permissible, by consent
    of the interested parties, for the clerk in such case to have placed the boxes

    must have, however, selected with the greatest care. Thomas v. Marshall, 160 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 168</cite>, 169 S.W. 615, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 420</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).

        If it was shown that the ballot boxes had properly
    reached the hands of the county clerk and had remained in his custody, and
    that the boxes were apparently in the condition of preservation prescribed
    by former statute, there was a presumption, in a recount proceeding, that
    the integrity of the ballots had been maintained, but if there was evidence
    that the boxes had been tampered with, or that there had been an opportunity
    for tampering, the party seeking the recount had the burden of proving that
    there had actually been no tampering and that the ballots were the identical
    ones cast in the election. Edwards v. Logan, 114 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 312</cite>, 70 S.W. 852, 75 S.W. 257, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L.

       <p>
        Fact that there were chisel marks on ballot box would

    party made delivery to the county clerk on Monday morning, such delay would
    not prevent the counting of the ballots where there was satisfactory proof

        Where evidence was that ballot boxes on being received

    papers, stencils and other material usable for tampering with the ballots,
    and although some of the individual boxes bore evidence of having been tampered

    not be counted. Hamilton v. Young, 81 S.W. 682, 26 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 447</cite> (1904) (decided
    under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a ballot box appeared to have been opened since
    its delivery to the clerk by the election officers, or if the ballots showed
    evidence of having been tampered with, the court would not have recounted
    the ballots but would have accepted the certificate of returns as evidence
    of the correct count. Browning v. Lovett, 29 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 692</cite> (1906) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the ballots had been changed, or so exposed as
    to afford opportunity to be tampered with, or had been left in the custody
    of a person so personally interested in the result of the election as to be
    subject to the temptation or inducement to tamper with them, they could not
    have been accepted as evidence of the vote in a contest proceeding. Scholl v. Bell, 125 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 750</cite>, 102 S.W. 248, 31 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 335</cite>, 1907 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 328</cite> (Ky. 1907) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Where ballot box was taken from election officers
    at close of polls by group of armed men and delivered to county clerk sometime
    later by that group, the ballots would not have been counted. Scholl v. Bell, 125 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 750</cite>, 102 S.W. 248, 31 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 335</cite>, 1907 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 328</cite> (Ky. 1907) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the canvassing officers count a ballot that should
    not be counted, the fact that the validity of the ballot was not questioned
    before them will not prevent its being questioned in a contest proceeding. Stegeman v. Cook, 126 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 114</cite>, 102 S.W. 872, 31 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 564</cite>, 1907 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 23</cite> (Ky. 1907) (decided under prior

       <p>
        Where there was evidence that ballot room had been
    entered on one occasion and one box stolen, and that several persons had entered
    the room on another occasion, a recount of the ballots would not be granted
    in the absence of convincing proof that there had been no actual tampering
    with the remaining boxes. Powell v. Horn, 159 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 532</cite>, 167 S.W. 928, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 862</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the count on a recount varied widely
    from the count as shown by the certificate of returns created a suspicion
    of tampering which the party seeking the recount must have overcome by convincing
    proof that there was no tampering. Thomas v. Marshall, 160 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 168</cite>, 169 S.W. 615, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 420</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).

        Where ballot boxes were left on floor of county clerk’s
    office, to which several persons had keys and which had unlocked windows close
    to the ground, there were keys to the boxes available in the office, lights
    were seen in the office late at night, and there was evidence that the ballots
    had actually been tampered with, the integrity of the ballots was in such
    doubt that a recount would not be granted. Thomas v. Marshall, 160 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 168</cite>, 169 S.W. 615, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 420</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).

        Where ballot boxes were stacked in outer office of
    county clerk, where people having regular business in office came and went,
    and persons were permitted to work in office alone at night, person seeking
    recount of ballots could not obtain recount without establishing by convincing
    proof that there had actually been no tampering. Thompson v. Stone, 164 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 18</cite>, 174 S.W. 763, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 327</cite> (Ky. 1915) (decided under prior law).

    office, there were keys which would open boxes in the office, the doors and
    windows of the office were not securely fastened, and there was evidence that
    two of the boxes had been moved, a recount was properly denied. Hicks v. Kimbro, 210 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 265</cite>, 275 S.W. 814, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 657</cite> (Ky. 1925) (decided under prior

    had an open window, boxes were locked only with ten-cent padlocks which could
    easily be opened, a number of official election seals were in the hands of
    outside persons, and the envelopes containing the stubs for certain precincts
    were stolen from the storeroom, there was such doubt as to whether the integrity
    of the ballots had been maintained that the court would not grant a recount. Ferguson v. Gregory, 216 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 382</cite>, 287 S.W. 952, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 935</cite> (Ky. 1926) (decided under prior

    such boxes had been altered, and one of the locks on box of another precinct
    was not fastened through the staple and the ballots in one race in such box
    had been altered, the ballots in such boxes would not be counted in any race,
    and where such precincts cast more than 20 percent of votes in any race the
    entire election in that race would be declared void. Scott v. Roberts, 255 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 34</cite>, 72 S.W.2d 728, 1934 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 177</cite> (Ky. 1934) (decided under prior law).

        A recount of the ballots would not have been made

    from the officer whose duty it was to have and preserve them, that they had
    been protected as provided by law since the election, and that they were apparently
    in the condition of preservation prescribed by former statute. Baker v. Dinsmore, 138 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 277</cite>, 127 S.W. 997, 1910 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 70</cite> (Ky. 1910) (decided under prior

        The party who sought a recount of the ballots must
    have tendered, in connection with his motion for a recount, evidence that
    the boxes had been carefully and properly preserved and not tampered with
    since their return by the election officers. The evidence might have been
    either in the form of depositions or by oral testimony. Powell v. Horn, 159 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 532</cite>, 167 S.W. 928, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 862</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).

        Before a recount would have been granted, the one
    seeking the recount must have proved clearly and satisfactorily that the ballot
    box had been kept as the statute requires, that the ballots had not been tampered

       <p>
        The presumption that the county clerk had done his
    duty in preserving the ballot boxes was not sufficient to justify a recount.
    The party seeking the recount must have offered evidence to establish that
    the boxes have been properly preserved, that there had been no opportunity

        The requirement of former statute that the ballot
    box, key and envelope be conveyed to the county clerk “forthwith”
    was mandatory, and required that the conveyance be made without unnecessary
    delay, or as quickly as practicable, or with due diligence under the particular
    circumstances. A failure to comply might have subjected the election officers
    to criminal liability. However, an unreasonable delay would not have resulted
    in the ballots of the precinct being thrown out if evidence was produced establishing

In section 5 of that Act (this statute), a reference to “runoff primary” that was not deleted by the drafter has been deleted in codification as a manifest clerical or typographical error by the Reviser of Statutes.

        Arguments between challengers of opposing parties,

        In a federal prosecution of a deputy clerk for participation in a vote buying conspiracy, the jury was incorrectly told that Kentucky law prohibited the clerk from supervising in-person absentee voting; because a challenger is not an election officer, a challenger’s presence did not result in equal representation of political parties, and the clerk’s supervision was proper. The error was not prejudicial because the jury was correctly instructed that the clerk could not lawfully assist voters. United States v. Risner, 737 Fed. Appx. 751, 2018 FED App. 0304N, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 16252 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2018</cite>).

      <p>
       Challengers may stay within the voting room while
    the vote is being polled, the election judges having no authority to eject
    them therefrom, and the challengers may exercise reasonable discretion in
    deciding where in the room they will post themselves, including withdrawing
    from the voting room when they feel it necessary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-95</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the fact that there is no official form
    for the designation of challengers and that there is no requirement that such
    appointments be notarized, a procedure whereby the challenger’s name and precinct
    is designated in writing and signed by the chairman of the county party complies
    with this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-702</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the regular election officers, a person
    must be designated a challenger at the polls in order for such person to challenge
    a voter who presents himself to vote. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-645</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A write-in candidate who did not qualify as an independent
    candidate for the office of magistrate would not be entitled to designate
    challengers. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-654</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least 25 percent of all the candidates of a particular
    party in the primary must combine and agree to recommend challengers in order
    for such challengers to be appointed, and when it speaks of all the candidates
    of a party, it means every candidate for every office to be voted for in the
    primary including state, district and local candidates. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-145</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason why challengers, designated in
    accordance with this section, could not serve as representatives to check
    the vote count; the statute plainly allows candidates to appoint such representatives
    with the only requirement being that the representatives must be designated
    to the county board of elections. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-190</cite>.

       The repair and maintenance of election machines are
    inevitable and necessary expenses and are thus characterized judicially as
    a cost of elections, which cost must be funded out of the county treasury
    directly as this section permits, or it could be funded by way of extending
    credit to the former county clerk against his excess fees for the calendar
    year in question. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-38</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inasmuch as the state is only liable for its share
    of the expense of a special school tax election if the election is paid for
    by the county, the state would not be authorized to pay any portion of the
    election cost where the expense is paid by a citizens educational advisory
    committee. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-214</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the fact that this section simply refers
    to “cost of the election,” in the absence of legislative restrictions
    all the expenses incurred in connection with the holding of an election must
    be included in determining such cost. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-421</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory requirement pertaining to the printing
    of special ballots for absent voters, disabled voters and for voting in emergency
    situations constitutes an election expense to be paid for by the fiscal court
    pursuant to the terms of this section and such costs cannot be allowed as
    a necessary office expense of the county court clerk under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.345" target="_blank">KRS 64.345</a></cite>. OAG

       Since <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc83As83A.050" target="_blank">KRS 83A.050</a></cite> requires cities to pay the cost
    of city elections only where the city election is held at a time other than
    the law prescribes for elections generally and since city officers can only
    be elected at general elections in November pursuant to Ky. Const., § 167
    and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc83As83A.040" target="_blank">KRS 83A.040</a></cite>, which is the time prescribed for elections generally for

    the 1981 general election. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-167</cite>.

Before requesting an examination or reexamination, any person, persons, or corporation shall pay to the State Treasurer a nonrefundable deposit of five hundred dollars ($500) and submit a test report from an independent testing authority approved by the State Board of Elections. The report shall demonstrate that the voting system meets all Election Assistance Commission voting system standards. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if these voting system standards have been amended less than thirty-six (36) months prior to the request for examination under this subsection, the State Board of Elections may approve and certify a voting system that meets the prior standards after determining:

The three (3) examiners shall submit one (1) written report on each voting system examined or reexamined to the State Board of Elections. The members of the State Board of Elections shall also examine or reexamine the voting system. A voting system shall be approved and certified if the examiners’ report states that the voting system meets all the requirements of Section 18 of this Act and applicable federal law, and the State Board of Elections finds that the voting system meets all of the requirements of Section 18 of this Act and applicable federal law.

    of a nonpartisan judicial candidate is set out in subsection (7) of this section,
    which states that the word “residence,” used in reference to a
    candidate, shall mean actual residence of the candidate, without regard to
    the residence of the spouse of the candidate. Noble v. Meagher, 686 S.W.2d 458, 1985 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 207</cite> (Ky. 1985).

        In determining the residency of a candidate, the
    principal focus must be on the residence of the candidate, as distinguished
    from the location of his family. Noble v. Meagher, 686 S.W.2d 458, 1985 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 207</cite> (Ky. 1985).

        The appellant was not a resident of the county in
    which he wished to run for judicial office where (1) he moved to a different
    county and obtained a driver’s license there, and (2) although he maintained
    a law office in the county in which he wished to run and sometimes spent nights
    there or at a nearby hotel, he did not actually live at either of those places. Mobley v. Armstrong, 978 S.W.2d 307, 1998 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 108</cite> (Ky. 1998).

    a certain party, was hearsay evidence and not admissible to prove how such
    voter voted. Edwards v. Logan, 114 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 312</cite>, 70 S.W. 852, 75 S.W. 257, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1099</cite>, 25 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 435</cite>, 1902 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 164</cite> (Ky. 1902) (decided

        Evidence that a voter was a member of a certain political
    party was not sufficient to establish that he voted for the candidates of
    that party at a general election. Felts v. Edwards, 181 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 287</cite>, 204 S.W. 145 (Ky. 1918). But see Tunks v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that voters subpoenaed by contestant did
    not appear, though coupled with evidence that they were friends of contestee,
    was not sufficient to establish that they had voted for contestee. Alsip v.

    in line to vote, and while there was no evidence as to how many voters sought
    to vote in the morning 167 registered voters did not vote, all the registered

        The keeping of the polls open for a short time after

        Although more than 20 percent of votes in a precinct

        A candidate who seeks to have votes thrown out on
    the ground that they were cast after closing time must allege the names of
    the illegal voters, and for whom they voted. The names of the voters can be
    ascertained from the stub book, and how they voted from their testimony. Hogg v. Caudill, 254 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 409</cite>, 71 S.W.2d 1020, 1934 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 105</cite> (Ky. 1934) (decided under prior

        Contestant who seeks to have votes thrown out on
    ground that they were cast after time polls are to be open must allege the
    names of the voters who so voted. Brock v. Williams, 260 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 569</cite>, 86 S.W.2d 324, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 524</cite> (Ky. 1935) (decided under prior law).

        Where 100 persons were in line at closing time and
    all were taken in and allowed to vote, their votes were contrary to former
    statute and they could be compelled to appear and disclose for whom they voted
    in order to subtract their vote from the total. Boone v. Humphrey, 349 S.W.2d 822, 1961 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 64</cite> (Ky. 1961) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Where polls were not kept open for full time required
    by former law, but it appeared that only two persons were thus deprived of
    the right to vote, the vote of the precinct would not be thrown out. Graham v. Graham, 68 S.W. 1093, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 548</cite>, 1902 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 425</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1902) (decided under prior

        The provisions of former section as to the hours

       </h5>
       <p>
        Fact that election officers were absent during part
    of election hours would not invalidate election, in absence of fraud. Major v. Barker, 99 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 305</cite>, 35 S.W. 543, 18 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 104</cite>, 1896 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 73</cite> (Ky. 1896) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Former section that designated the hours the polls
    were to be open contemplated that all of the election officers should be present
    during the hours the polls were to be kept open, and it was the duty of the
    officers to be so present. But where some of election officers were absent
    at different times during the day, and it could not be determined for which
    candidates votes were cast during the absence, the entire vote of the precinct
    would not be thrown out on that account, there being no evidence that the
    absence was not involuntary or that any voter was hindered or prevented from
    voting by reason of the absence. Anderson v. Likens, 104 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 699</cite>, 47 S.W. 867, 20 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1001</cite>, 1898 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 214</cite> (Ky. 1898) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Election officers may be punished for not being in
    attendance during hours polls are to be open, and their absence during those
    hours may be treated as fraud in some circumstances. Anderson v. Likens, 104 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 699</cite>, 47 S.W. 867, 20 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1001</cite>, 1898 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 214</cite> (Ky. 1898) (decided under prior law).

       Where a county sheriff died on or about May 3, 1975,
    which was too late for candidates to file and run in the May primary for the
    unexpired term, the major parties were authorized to make nominations for
    the November election pursuant to party rules under this section and, at the
    same time, any qualified person could file a petition to become an independent
    candidate for the office in question at the coming November election under
    the authority expressed in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.375" target="_self">KRS 118.375</a></cite> so that any person desiring to run
    as an independent must file a petition on a form prescribed by the state board
    which is in accordance with the requirements of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.315" target="_self">KRS 118.315</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-401</cite>.

      <p>
       Where the county sheriff has died, the county clerk
    should list the nominees for sheriff made by the respective party committees
    in the straight party column to enable a person voting the straight party
    ticket in November to vote for one of the nominees for sheriff for the unexpired
    term as this section provides in the preparation of ballots, candidates for
    full terms are to be grouped together and candidates for unexpired terms are
    to be grouped together, under appropriate headings, so that the voter can
    easily distinguish the candidates for full terms from the candidates for unexpired
    terms. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-417</cite>; <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-613</cite>.

    choice pursuant to their party rules and file a statement of nomination with
    the county clerk not less than 55 days before the general election as provided

       In preparing the ballot for the November election
    in which there are candidates from the Republican and Democrat parties as
    well as at least five independent candidates running for the unexpired term
    of sheriff, since the independent candidates did not indicate any independent
    party designation or symbol, together with the probability that there would
    not be enough columns on the voting machine to list each independent candidate
    in a separate column, it would appear to be less confusing to the voter to
    list the independents in a single column with instructions to vote for one.

        The requirement of the former section that the candidate

    ballot, but a candidate of a political party needs only two signatures to
    be placed on the primary ballot under the provisions of this section, does
    not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution,
    since it reflects the Legislature’s recognition of the differences between
    established, well-financed parties and candidates and those parties and candidates

        The affidavit required by subsection (3) of this

        The requirement of the former section that the candidate

    the vote, or actual support in other proper ways. Hager v. Robinson, 154 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 489</cite>, 157 S.W. 1138, 1913 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 129</cite> (Ky. 1913) (decided under prior law).

       Though a person registered as an independent could
    not qualify to run in the 1976 May primary as a Democrat or Republican under
    the terms of this section and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc116s116.055" target="_self">KRS 116.055</a></cite>, since he must not only possess
    all the qualifications required of voters in the primary but must also be
    a registered member of the party in whose primary election he seeks to vote
    and must have been registered as a member of that party at the time of the
    preceding regular election, he could still run as an independent by filing
    a petition as prescribed in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.315" target="_self">KRS 118.315</a></cite> not later than March 31, 1976, as

       Where a vacancy occurs in a magisterial district,
    any candidate desiring to run for the unexpired term as a major party nominee
    would have to file not less than 55 days before the May primary a notification
    and declaration paper containing the signatures of two electors. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-179</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not require that the electors executing
    the affidavit reside within the county or district from which the candidate
    runs or state they intend to vote for the candidate. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-84</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that an individual who signed a candidate’s

       A registered Democrat who decides to run for office as an independent in the fall election may vote as a Democrat in the spring primary election prior to the next fall election so long as he was registered as a Democrat in the fall election preceding the spring primary and provided he remains registered as a Democrat through the spring primary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-55</cite>.

      <p>
       Where a person files as an independent candidate in

       It is not a violation of a primary candidate’s constitutional
    right to secret ballot, as set out in Ky. Const., § 147, to require
    him to state under oath that he supported his parties’ nominees in the last
    regular election and will support the parties’ nominees in the next regular
    election before allowing him to register as a candidate in a primary election;
    the term “support,” as used in subsection (2) of this section,
    does not necessarily mean that the candidate must have voted the party ticket
    at the last regular election, but it could consist of advocating the claims
    of the party nominees, contributing to campaign expenses, getting out to vote
    or actual support in other ways. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-24</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an individual changed his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican subsequent to the 1984 November election, he was disqualified from becoming a candidate in the May primary for either party; he could, however, change his registration back to that of Democrat and be qualified to seek nomination as a member of that party, or he could run as an independent. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-42</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A candidate is eligible to run in the 1993 primary if he changed his party affiliation after the November 1992 election, and then switched back to his original party affiliation before filing to run in the primary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 93-8</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to designate a campaign treasurer does not prevent a candidate’s name from appearing on the ballot, although it may have other adverse consequences, such as sanctions specified in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc121s121.990" target="_self">KRS 121.990</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 2005-08</cite>.

        Since the Secretary of State examined the notification and declaration papers of the slate of candidates, determined that the documents were regular on their face, and the filing deadline passed without any change in the slate, the candidate’s running mate was “disqualified” within the meaning of

       Candidates for Circuit Judge are permitted to run
    for nomination in the primary as candidates for both political parties as
    well as independents, but where a candidate running on both tickets in the
    primary was defeated, in order to run as an independent for Circuit Judge,
    he must have filed his petition not later than 55 days before the May primary,
    which was the same filing deadline for party nominees. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-424</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an election to fill a vacancy on a city council,
    if the candidate was seeking a party nomination, his notification and declaration
    papers for the 1976 primary must have been filed no later than March 31, 1976.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-15</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inasmuch as the notification requirements apply only
    to those candidates filing notification and declaration papers for a primary
    election, neither the Secretary of State nor the county clerk is required
    to notify independent candidates filing petitions for the November election.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-750</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where one of the electors executing the affidavit
    on behalf of a candidate changed his party affiliation subsequent to the last
    November election, he is disqualified as a qualified elector for the primary
    election, since he must not only have been affiliated with the candidate’s
    party at the last November election but must also remain so affiliated under
    <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc116s116.055" target="_self">KRS 116.055</a></cite> and the candidate in question should withdraw his filing papers
    and execute one that complies with the statutory requirement since his papers
    are defective, but he may, upon notification under this section, correct such
    error not later than 72 hours after the filing deadline; otherwise his name
    shall not be placed on the ballot. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-126</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1984 amendment to this section eliminated the
    provision allowing a candidate to correct any error found on the face of the
    petition not later than 72 hours after the filing deadline. Thus, once the
    deadline for filing has lapsed, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.365" target="_self">KRS 118.365</a></cite>, the filing papers of the
    candidate cannot be changed or corrected. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-67</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a nominating paper is regular on its face, that
    is, properly filled out and duly notarized as required with respect to a candidate’s
    notification and declaration paper, the clerk has no choice but to place the
    name of the nominee on the ballot as requested by the nominating paper; he
    cannot question the qualification of the candidate or his signers or go behind
    the face of the certificate of nomination. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-67</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county clerk is not required to check the name
    of the two signers of a candidate’s notification and declaration paper to
    determine whether or not they are registered members of his political party.
    The determination of this question is a matter for an opposing candidate or
    a qualified voter of the party to raise in circuit court pursuant to the provisions
    of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.176" target="_self">KRS 118.176</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-67</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 120-day filing deadline established in this section
    and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.365" target="_self">KRS 118.365</a></cite> and 118A.060 was meant to uniformly apply to all filing deadlines,
    except those for municipal offices, and therefore by implication applies to
    candidates seeking unexpired terms under the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.115" target="_self">KRS 118.115</a></cite>, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.375" target="_self">118.375

       Failure to designate a campaign treasurer does not prevent a candidate’s name from appearing on the ballot, although it may have other adverse consequences, such as sanctions specified in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc121s121.990" target="_self">KRS 121.990</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 2005-08</cite>.

       The bona fides of any candidate seeking nomination as the nominee of a political party or a nonpartisan or judicial nominee in a primary or election to an office as a member of a political organization, political group, or as an independent in a special or regular election may be questioned by any qualified voter entitled to vote for the candidate or by an opposing candidate by summary proceedings consisting of a motion before the Circuit Court of the judicial circuit in which the candidate whose bona fides is questioned resides. An action regarding the bona fides of the nominee of a political party or a nonpartisan or judicial nominee may be commenced at any time prior to the primary. An action regarding the bona fides for election to an office as a member of a political organization, political group, or as an independent may be commenced at any time prior to a special or regular election. The motion shall be tried summarily and without delay. Proof may be heard orally, and upon motion of either party shall be officially reported. If the Circuit Judge of the circuit in which the proceeding is filed is disqualified or absent from the county or is herself or himself a candidate, the proceeding may be presented to, heard and determined by the Circuit Judge of any adjoining judicial circuit.

       If the court finds the candidate is not a bona fide candidate it shall so order, and certify the fact to the board of elections, and the candidate’s name shall be stricken from the written designation of election officers filed with the board of elections or the court may refuse recognition or relief in a mandatory or injunctive way. The order of the Circuit Court shall be entered on the order book of the court and shall be subject to a motion to set aside in the Court of Appeals. The motion shall be heard by the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof in the manner provided for dissolving or granting injunctions, except that the motion shall be made before the court or judge within five (5) days after the entry of the order in the Circuit Court, and may be heard and tried upon the original papers, and the order of the Court of Appeals or judge thereof shall be final.

        This section applies to nonpartisan judicial elections,

        Incumbent was not entitled to a writ of mandamus because a candidate's declaratory judgment action was not a challenge to his bona fides, but was a challenge to the statute that prevented him from being a bona fide candidate, the incumbent failed to satisfy the threshold criteria for obtaining relief by an original action, and there was no sufficient showing that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction or acted erroneously within its jurisdiction to the incumbent's irreparable detriment.

    voter to bring a summary action in Circuit Court to prevent the proposed candidate’s
    name from appearing on the ballot. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-677</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a candidate’s filing papers are in order the county
    clerk must accept them without going behind the papers to determine the candidate’s
    qualifications, for it is up to an opposing candidate or a qualified voter
    to bring an action to disqualify the candidate. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-160</cite>.

      <p>
       Where there was a question as to whether one of the
    magisterial candidates nominated at the May primary legally resided in the
    particular magisterial district from which he was nominated, neither the fiscal
    court nor county board of elections nor any other county agency had any duty
    or authority to investigate or intervene in the matter of the candidate’s
    residence; however, if the candidate had been elected and assumed office without
    possessing the residential qualifications as required by the Kentucky Constitution
    he would have been subject to removal as a usurper by the Commonwealth’s attorney
    under the terms of KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc415" target="_blank">Chapter 415</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-513</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a candidate’s petition contained only 18 valid
    signatures following the deduction of those who had previously signed an opposing
    candidate’s petition, the petition did not qualify under the terms of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc83As83A.170" target="_blank">KRS 83A.170</a></cite> requiring a minimum of 20 petitioners. However, where the petition
    was not challenged either by an opponent or a qualified voter in court pursuant
    to this section before the primary, nor was the clerk requested, before the
    primary, to check the signatures against the registration record of signers,
    and the candidate was, as a consequence, nominated for office, the filing
    papers could not be challenged after the nomination and before the election.
    <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-512</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a candidate for a municipal office does in fact
    move out of the city prior to his election, the question of disqualifying
    him by having his name removed from the ballot is a matter that must be determined
    by a Circuit Court action brought by an opposing candidate under the terms
    of this section; if such action is not brought at that time, his qualifications
    cannot be attacked after the election in a contest suit. On the other hand,
    if he is not a legal resident when he enters office, he becomes a usurper
    subject to removal by the Attorney General under the usurpation statute, particularly
    <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.36.html#tXXXVIc415s415.050" target="_blank">KRS 415.050</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-12</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county clerk is not required to check the names
    of the two signers of a candidate’s notification and declaration paper to
    determine whether or not they are registered members of his political party.
    The determination of this question is a matter for an opposing candidate or
    a qualified voter of the party to raise in Circuit Court pursuant to the provisions
    of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-67</cite>.

    a certificate of nomination. Hettel v. Furste, 260 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 844</cite>, 86 S.W.2d 1018, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 570</cite> (Ky. 1935) (decided under prior law).

        When the candidate and the running mate formed an election slate upon the Secretary of State certifying to the county clerk their names, places of residence, and party affiliation, the slate acquired a legal existence that continued until the running mate was found by a trial court not to be a bona fide candidate; accordingly, the subsequent finding that the running mate was “disqualified to hold the office sought,” and the Secretary of State’s certification of a vacancy on the slate permitted the candidate, under

        The county clerk was liable in damages for failing

       Where a candidate for mayor and city council have
    filed independent petitions for their offices, they must be listed on the
    November ballot in a single, vertical column by lot under the office they
    seek in accordance with this section, but there can be no independent party
    designation above or by their names; however, independent candidates for the
    office of magistrate must be listed each in separate columns under the independent
    party name and symbol that they designated, or, if none is designated, under
    the title “Independent.” <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-265</cite>.

       Subsection (1) of this section clearly authorizes
    independent candidates for all offices, other than municipal and school board,
    to select a brief name or title of the party he desires to represent as well
    as a simple figure or device that he desires to be designated under on the
    voting machines. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-279</cite>.

       Candidates running as independents for the office
    of city council may file either individual petitions or a group petition containing
    not more than the number of councilmen to be elected; regardless of how the
    candidates file, whether individually or by group, they must draw for positions
    on the ballot by lot as required by subsection (3) of this section. Under
    the present statute independents cannot as permitted in the past designate
    individual party symbols and names and be listed separately; they are to be
    grouped according to the office they seek in a single column. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-408</cite>.

       The office of magistrate/representative should be

       Failure to designate a campaign treasurer does not prevent a candidate’s name from appearing on the ballot, although it may have other adverse consequences, such as sanctions specified in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc121s121.990" target="_self">KRS 121.990</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 2005-08</cite>.

        The right to vote and be voted for is a constitutional

       <p>
        When a petition of nomination is regular on its face,
    the county clerk must place the name of the nominee on the ballot as requested
    by the petition, and he cannot question the qualifications of the persons
    who signed the petition. Wilkins v. Duffy, 114 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 111</cite>, 70 S.W. 668, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 913</cite>, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L.

       </p>
       <p>
        When a certificate of nomination made under party
    law is filed substantially in the form and manner prescribed by statute, the
    county clerk has no right to go behind the certificate to determine whether
    the nomination was rightfully done. Commonwealth v. Combs, 120 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 368</cite>, 86 S.W. 697, 27 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 751</cite>, 1905 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 112</cite> (Ky. 1905) (decided under prior law).

        In a contest of a regular election, the contestant
    had the right to challenge the legality of the means whereby the contestee
    procured the placing of his name on the ballot. Francis v. Sturgill, 163 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 650</cite>, 174 S.W. 753, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        The fact that a person whose name was placed on the
    ballot as the candidate of a political party was not legally nominated as
    a candidate of such party may be proved in a contest proceeding, and if proved
    would deprive such candidate of the right to the election. Francis v. Sturgill, 163 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 650</cite>, 174 S.W. 753, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

    without notice if the time remaining before the date of the regular election
    is so short that the candidate will not have time to establish his right to

       A candidate for any office to be voted for at any regular election may be nominated by a petition of electors qualified to vote for him or her, complying with the provisions of subsection (2) of this section. No person whose registration status is as a registered member of a political party shall be eligible to election as an independent, or political organization, or political group candidate, nor shall any person be eligible to election as an independent, or political organization, or political group candidate whose registration status was as a registered member of a political party on January 1 immediately preceding the regular election for which the person seeks to be a candidate.

It shall not be necessary that the signatures of the petition be appended to one (1) paper. Each petitioner shall include the date he or she affixes the signature, address of residence, and date of birth. Failure of a voter to include the signature affixation date, date of birth, and address of residence shall result in the signature not being counted. If any person joins in nominating, by petition, more than one (1) nominee for any office to be filled, he or she shall be counted as a petitioner for the candidate whose petition is filed first, except a petitioner for the nomination of candidates for soil and water conservation district supervisors may be counted for every petition to which his or her signature is affixed.

        The requirement of subsection (2) of this section
    that a candidate’s petition include a declaration that “the subscribers
    desire
    . . . . .
    to vote for the
    candidate” violates the right to a secret ballot guaranteed by Ky. Const.,
    § 147, since the declaration operates to discourage signers from
    participating in the electoral process by revealing how they would vote. Anderson v. Mills, 664 F.2d 600, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 15841 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1981</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of subsection (2) of this section,
    that only those supporters of a candidate who is attempting to be placed on
    the general election ballot through a petition need to declare that they desire
    to vote for that particular candidate, imposes an unnecessary burden on voting
    and associational rights in violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., amend. 14; there is no compelling reason for making the declaration
    a mandatory part of the election in light of the less burdensome alternatives,
    such as restrictions on primary voting, to achieve the fundamental state interest. Anderson v. Mills, 664 F.2d 600, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 15841 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1981</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory scheme whereby a candidate is required
    by this section to obtain 5,000 signatures in order to be placed on the general
    ballot, but a candidate of a political party needs only two signatures to
    be placed on the primary ballot under the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.125" target="_self">KRS 118.125</a></cite>, does
    not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution,
    since it reflects the Legislature’s recognition of the differences between
    established, well-financed parties and candidates and those parties and candidates
    who have no elaborate political network by providing greater access to the
    political process than a single route to the general election ballot. Anderson v. Mills, 664 F.2d 600, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 15841 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1981</cite>).

       <p>
        The 1990 amendment to this section requiring nominating
    petitions to be signed by registered voters of the same political party affiliation
    as the petitioning candidate is unconstitutional and must be severed from
    this statute. Libertarian Party of Kentucky v. Ehrler, 776 F. Supp. 1200, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16002 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1991</cite>).

       <p>
        The 1990 amendment to this section that a voter who
    signs a nominating petition must include his Social Security number in order
    for his signature to be counted is in violation of Section VII of the Federal
    Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-579, Title 5 USCS § 552a, and
    must be severed from this statute. Libertarian Party of Kentucky v. Ehrler, 776 F. Supp. 1200, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16002 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1991</cite>).

        The requirement in subsection (2) of this section
    that a nominating petition of an independent candidate or a minority party
    candidate for statewide office contain the signatures of 5,000 registered
    voters in Kentucky is constitutional. Libertarian Party of Kentucky v. Ehrler, 776 F. Supp. 1200, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16002 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1991</cite>).

        The primary election law did not repeal that part
    of former similar section providing for nomination by petition of candidates
    who do not seek to be placed upon the ballot under the emblem of a political
    party within the meaning of the primary election law. Eagle v. Cox, 268 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 58</cite>, 103 S.W.2d 682, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 411</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        While former similar section referred to “a
    candidate,” it was not to be construed as prohibiting several candidates
    for different offices from being grouped as one organization or under one
    name or device. Greene v. Slusher, 300 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 715</cite>, 190 S.W.2d 29, 1945 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 628</cite> (Ky. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former similar section dealt only with nomination
    of independent candidates by petition and could not be used to keep the name
    of a candidate for justice of the peace off the primary ballot on grounds
    that the affidavits supporting his notification and declaration were filed
    by persons not qualified electors of the magisterial district involved. Brown v. Read, 311 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 104</cite>, 223 S.W.2d 592, 1949 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1074</cite> (Ky. 1949) (decided under prior

       <p>
        Statute uses mandatory language of “shall” when requiring petitioners to date when they sign the nominating petition and “shall not” when specifying that the petition should not be signed earlier than a certain date; while the statute provides that certain missing information, including the lack of a date shall result in the signature not being counted, it does not specify the result which will follow if the petition contains a date that indicates the petitioner signed the petition prematurely. Stoecklin v. Fennell, 526 S.W.3d 104, 2017 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 440</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).

        Requirement in the statute that the nominating petition signatures be dated or they will not count, is not mandatory, so long as it can be established that the petition signers are eligible voters for the relevant election; if the provision that signatures be dated or they will not count is not mandatory, it is not logical to interpret the provision that voters must not sign before a certain date (which does not specify a penalty for noncompliance) as mandatory. Stoecklin v. Fennell, 526 S.W.3d 104, 2017 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 440</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).

        Requirement that petitioners not sign a nominating petition before a certain date is intended to ensure that voters sign the petition for the next election and will still likely be residents; where two voters sign the petition a day early, another voter signs two days early and another voter signs two weeks early, this intent was still accomplished, and the date on which the petition is signed is a mere directory requirement as to timing that does not affect the merits of the election.

        It was not necessary that a petition seeking to have

    that the party has failed to nominate by convention. When the time for filing
    evidences of nomination has closed, if there was only one nomination of a

        If a petition of nomination is properly signed, and
    the nominee is designated as a member and candidate of a political party for

    must place the nominee on the ballot as the candidate of such party, unless
    a certificate of nomination by convention is filed before the time for filing
    expires, or unless petition for another candidate of such party has previously
    been filed. Wilkins v. Duffy, 114 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 111</cite>, 70 S.W. 668, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 913</cite>, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 968</cite>, 1902 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 157</cite> (Ky. 1902) (decided

       The nominating petitions filed by candidates for the
    board of education of an independent school district, parts of which lie in
    two (2) counties, must be filed with the county clerks of each of the two
    (2) counties, the original copy with one county clerk and a duplicate copy

       The statutory requirements that petitioners state
    that the nominee is legally qualified to hold the office and that the petitioners
    desire and are legally qualified to vote for the nominee are mandatory and
    any petition which fails to state these facts is not sufficient to establish
    the nominee to be placed on the ballots. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-676</cite>.
      </p>

       After a petition has been filed and accepted by the

       If the clerk conditionally accepts a petition pending
    a determination as to its compliance with the requirements of this section,
    he may reject it when the petition is determined invalid; but if it was accepted

       A person running as an independent candidate for any

    subsequently filed, the names of both candidates should be listed on the general
    election ballot (following a drawing for position) under the heading of “city

       Defeated candidates in the Republican primary for

    with a symbol or device to represent said independent party. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-279</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a number of candidates desire to run as an independent
    ticket with each candidate seeking a separate office, the number of signers
    required would be the same as that required of an individual candidate, which
    in the case of statewide offices would be 5,000 signatures of registered voters
    under the requirements of this section. This is based on the theory that each
    petitioner would have been entitled to sign the petition of each candidate
    had he filed individually. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-279</cite>.

       The provisions of § 7 (5 USCS § 552a

    from denying an individual any right or privilege provided by law because
    of such individual’s refusal to disclose his Social Security account number,
    unless such disclosure requirement was in existence before January 1, 1975;
    therefore, since the requirement of subsection (2) of this section that the
    petitioner state his Social Security account number when signing a petition
    on behalf of an independent candidate was inserted by amendment in 1982, it
    must be construed as directory only. Thus being directory, the fact that the
    petitioner does not indicate his Social Security account number will not affect
    the validity of his signature in ascertaining the required number of petitioners
    necessary to establish the fact that the candidate has complied with the filing
    requirements of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-437</cite>.

        The primary election law did not repeal that part

        Ordinarily, the requisites of former similar section

        Where county clerk knew personally that persons signing
    certificate of nomination were chairman and secretary of county committee
    of party, and that nominees in certificate were residents of county, failure
    of chairman and secretary to have their signatures acknowledged, and failure
    of certificate to state their residence or the residence of the nominees,
    would not justify clerk in refusing to accept certificate and place names
    of nominees on ballot, in the absence of a protest by other nominees. Hallon v. Center, 102 <cite class="ocky"></cite>, 43 S.W. 174, 19 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1134</cite> (1897) (decided under prior

        When a certificate of nomination made under party
    law is filed substantially in the form and manner prescribed by the statutes,
    the county clerk has no right to go behind the certificate to determine whether
    the nomination was rightfully done. Commonwealth v. Combs, 120 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 368</cite>, 86 S.W. 697, 27 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 751</cite>, 1905 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 112</cite> (Ky. 1905) (decided under prior law).

        Whether or not a political party entitled to nominate

    his records, and if his records show no certificate of nomination by the party
    the clerk may place upon the ballot as the candidate of that party the first
    person who files a proper petition of nomination designating such person as
    the candidate of that party. In case another petition is filed, the clerk
    shall designate a suitable device for the candidate therein named, as provided
    in former law. However, if the party files a certificate of nomination by
    convention before the time for filing such certificates has expired, such
    certificate will supersede petitions previously filed. Skidmore v. Hurst, 113 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 694</cite>, 68 S.W. 841, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 536</cite>, 1902 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 90</cite> (Ky. 1902) (decided under prior law).

        Where candidate was nominated by party convention
    and filed his certificate of nomination, but the party authorities then revoked
    the nomination and filed a certificate nominating another person, whereupon
    the first candidate filed a petition of nomination, such candidate was entitled
    to have his name placed on the ballot as nominated by petition without making
    the written request required by the former similar section. The fact that
    the candidate had obtained an injunction against the party authorities restraining
    them from nominating any other person made no difference where the injunction
    was dissolved before the ballots were printed. Eversole v. Holliday, 123 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 496</cite>, 96 S.W. 590, 29 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 927</cite>, 1906 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 168</cite> (Ky. 1906) (decided under prior law).

    such a person may be voted for by “write-in” votes. Mullins v. Jackson, 270 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 149</cite>, 109 S.W.2d 387, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 36</cite> (Ky. 1937).

        This section, the so-called “sore-loser”

    lose his party’s nomination for president by losing the state’s primary election
    and since the legislature made no attempt by amendment to accommodate the
    presidential preference primary. Anderson v. Mills, 664 F.2d 600, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 15841 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1981</cite>).

        Injunctive relief would not be granted to a presidential
    candidate who sought to have his name stricken from the ballot of a presidential
    primary election, where the presidential candidate, who had been running as
    a Republican at the time the board of elections nominated him to appear on
    the primary ballot but who decided to seek the presidency as an independent,
    did not give written notice of the withdrawal of his candidacy until after
    the Secretary of State’s certification of the primary ballot. Anderson v. Mills, 491 F. Supp. 1231, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13620 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1980</cite>).

       <p>
        This section applies only to those offices where
    a nomination is gained or lost through a primary process, not through a national

    nomination did not preclude him from having his name placed on the general
    election ballot as an independent candidate. Anderson v. Mills, 664 F.2d 600, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 15841 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1981</cite>).

        Candidate who was defeated in Democratic primary
    could not be nominated to fill vacancy in Republican candidacy and where a
    candidate was so nominated and was placed on the ballot as the candidate of

    be sufficient to deprive such candidate of the election. Francis v. Sturgill, 163 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 650</cite>, 174 S.W. 753, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       This section does not prevent a candidate defeated

    for said office after the primary, such as for a municipal or school board
    office. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-424</cite>.

      <p>
       Although a candidate who has been defeated for nomination
    in the May primary could not have his name placed on the voting machine in
    the succeeding November election as a candidate for the same office, he could
    run as a “write-in” candidate for any office in November. OAG

       Where a candidate’s party nomination at the primary

       Although a candidate for magistrate who was defeated
    in the primary could not have his name placed on the November ballot for the
    office of magistrate, he would be eligible to have his name placed on the
    ballot for any other office for which he could file an independent petition.

      </p>
      <p>
       A candidate defeated in the primary may run as a “write-in”
    candidate for the same office in November, even though this section prohibits
    a defeated candidate from having his name placed on the ballot in the November
    election, since he has a constitutional right to run as a “write-in”
    candidate. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-289</cite>.

       Defeated candidates in the Republican primary for
    statewide offices can run as an independent group for offices for which they
    were not defeated by filing a single petition with a minimum of 5,000 signatures

    with a symbol or device to represent said independent party. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-279</cite>.

       <p>
        A certificate or petition may be “filed”
    by delivering it to the custody of the clerk, accompanied with the communication
    to the clerk of the desire on the part of the candidate that it be filed.
    There is no requirement that the clerk indorse the date and fact of filing. Daniel v. Blankenship, 177 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 726</cite>, 198 S.W. 48, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 657</cite> (Ky. 1917) (decided under prior

        Evidence of nomination need not be filed by candidate
    in person. Hewlett v. Carter, 194 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 454</cite>, 239 S.W. 789, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 179</cite> (Ky. 1922) (decided

        Filing of certificate of returns with county clerk
    by board of election commissioners did not constitute compliance with requirement
    that certificate of nomination be filed. Lewis v. Mosely, 215 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 573</cite>, 286 S.W. 793, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 766</cite> (Ky. 1926) (decided under prior law).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In the case of a city situated in more than one county,
    certificates and petitions of nomination for city offices should have been
    filed with the county clerk of each county, and not with the secretary of
    state. If the petition filed with one of the clerks was sufficient in form,
    the fact that the petition filed with the other clerk was deficient would
    not invalidate the nomination. Eagle v. Cox, 268 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 58</cite>, 103 S.W.2d 682, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 411</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior law).

        Where Republican candidate had no opposition in primary
    it was the duty of the clerk to deliver a certificate of nomination to the
    candidate and thus where clerk was requested to file certificates of nomination
    for some of the Republican nominees it would be presumed that the request
    applied to the certificates of all Republican nominees and therefore there
    was sufficient compliance with the law as respects the filing of certificates
    of nomination. Hurt v. Bell, 274 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 318</cite>, 118 S.W.2d 785, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 291</cite> (Ky. 1938) (decided

        Candidate nominated by party convention had responsibility
    of seeing that certificate of nomination was filed in time. Where chairman
    and secretary of party convention prepared and filed certificates of nomination
    for party ticket, but inadvertently omitted name of one candidate, he could
    not recover damages from chairman and secretary. Brodie v. Haswell, 160 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 405</cite>, 169 S.W. 856, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 470</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).

        When a candidate had been awarded a certificate of
    election, the validity of the election could have been attacked only in contest
    proceedings, and not in an action for usurpation of office. Stine v. Berry, 96 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 63</cite>, 27 S.W. 809, 16 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 279</cite>, 1894 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 81</cite> (Ky. 1894) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        The certificate of election gives the holder the
    prima facie right to the office covered by the certificate, and he cannot
    be enjoined from discharging the duties of the office pending a contest. Harrison v. Stroud, 129 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 193</cite>, 110 S.W. 828, 33 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 653</cite>, 1908 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 147</cite> (Ky. 1908) (decided under prior

        A certificate of election is not conclusive as to
    the holder’s eligibility for the office, when his eligibility is denied in
    a direct proceeding against him attacking his right to exercise the duties
    of the office. Hermann v. Lampe, 175 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 109</cite>, 194 S.W. 122, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 306</cite> (Ky. 1917) (decided

        Though contestant in election contest did not demand

        Where Court of Appeals, on appeal in contest suit,
    found that there was a tie vote, the case was remanded to the lower court
    with directions that the board of election commissioners be ordered to reconvene
    and determine by lot which candidate was elected. Covington v. Joiner, 200 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 378</cite>, 254 S.W. 1048, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 90</cite> (Ky. 1923).

        County board of election commissioners had authority

       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is a tie between two candidates for the
    office of city councilman, the county board of election commissioners has
    no authority to determine by lot which is the successful candidate, or to
    issue a certificate of election. In such case the board must certify the returns
    to the city council, which has power to “judge of the eligibility and
    election returns of its members.” Rose v. Turner, 301 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 272</cite>, 191 S.W.2d 397, 1945 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 730</cite> (Ky. 1945) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestants in election recount proceeding, wherein
    a tied vote was agreed upon, could not waive the statutory duty of the board
    of election commissioners to determine election by lot, and therefore the
    court exceeded its power and jurisdiction in attempting to give force and
    effect to such a waiver. Little v. Mann, 302 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 661</cite>, 195 S.W.2d 321, 1946 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 737</cite> (Ky. 1946) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        In an election on a public question, the only power
    of the board of election commissioners is to certify how many votes were cast
    for and against the proposition; the board has no power to declare whether
    or not the question has been carried by the required majority. Denton v. Pulaski County, 170 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 33</cite>, 185 S.W. 481, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 9</cite> (Ky. 1916). See Smith v. Livingston County, 195 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 382</cite>, 242 S.W. 612, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        In an election on the question of issuing county

       The term “tabulate,” as used in this section,

      </p>
      <p>
       Since an election commission is a ministerial body
    and has no authority to determine the validity of the election, the commission
    must certify the candidate receiving the most votes in a primary election,

        Where a county chairman was chosen from each county
    by respective political parties, each county chairman had one vote in selecting
    the party nominee, regardless of the population of the respective counties,

        The language “or who in any manner causes himself
    to be registered when he is not legally entitled to register,” when
    considered with other Kentucky statutes regarding qualification for voting,
    is sufficiently definite to put an ordinary person on notice that a convicted
    felon attempting to register would be in violation; therefore the section
    cannot be said to be unconstitutionally vague. Commonwealth v. Kash, 967 S.W.2d 37, 1997 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 119</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).

        Conviction for illegally registering did not bar
    subsequent prosecution for false swearing, although false swearing upon which
    second prosecution was based was done in connection with the illegal registering. Hughes v. Commonwealth, 131 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 502</cite>, 115 S.W. 744, 1909 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 48</cite> (Ky. 1909) (decided under prior

       There is no reasonable, natural or logical basis for
    the classification contained in this section; the various substantive provisions
    of the two subsections would apply equally in all cities and counties, and
    there is no basis for holding that certain substantive acts or a particular
    penalty should be unique to cities of the first class. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 89-84</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, in its entirety, is unconstitutional;
    it is not amenable to severability because the provisions are too intertwined,
    thus making it impossible to determine the intent of the legislature if one
    or the other of the two subsections are deemed to be unconstitutional. OAG

        County clerk had duty to place on ballot names of

       <p>
        Injunction issued by circuit clerk a few days before
    election, and without notice, restraining county clerk from placing names
    of certain candidates on ballot, was void. In such case, if county clerk honestly
    believed that injunction was valid and acted in reliance upon it, he was not
    guilty of violating former identical section, but where there was evidence
    that county clerk knew that injunction was part of fraudulent scheme to deprive
    party nominees of place on ballot, and county clerk, who had been defeated
    in primary for renomination, was one of plaintiffs in injunction suit, it
    was a jury question as to whether he “willfully” failed to place

        In order to constitute a violation of provision prohibiting

        Before a person can be prosecuted for repeated voting

    a ballot, went into the booth and remained there long enough to stamp it,

    that he voted the ballot. Commonwealth v. Baker, 237 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 380</cite>, 35 S.W.2d 548, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 611</cite> (Ky. 1931) (decided under prior law).

        This section lacks minimal objective guidelines for
    its application and therefore threatens the constitutional rights of all Kentucky
    citizens; it is violative of Ky. Const., §§ 1(4) and 2 and
    it may also violate Ky. Const., § 6. Commonwealth v. Foley, 798 S.W.2d 947, 1990 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 121</cite> (Ky. 1990), overruled in part, Martin v. Commonwealth, 96 S.W.3d 38, 2003 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 8</cite> (Ky. 2003).

        This section as written is so broad and subject to

       <p>
        Upon review of this section as a whole, it would
    not be unreasonable to interpret it to prohibit the use of any money or thing
    of value with the intent to influence voters; such an interpretation is absurd
    and repugnant to the concept of free elections and the singular purpose of
    an election campaign and every undertaking attendant thereto is for the influencing
    of voters. The idea that candidates may solicit campaign funds and expend
    money to enhance the likelihood of their election, and at the same time be
    prohibited from spending money or things of value with the intent to influence
    voters is inherently contradictory. Commonwealth v. Foley, 798 S.W.2d 947, 1990 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 121</cite> (Ky. 1990), overruled in part, Martin v. Commonwealth, 96 S.W.3d 38, 2003 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 8</cite> (Ky. 2003).

       <p>
        The language contained in subdivisions (5)(a) and
    (b) of this section is so indefinite that its effect is to create the potential
    that any person who engages in the conduct impliedly authorized therein will
    be required to persuade a petit jury that the conduct was within normal or
    reasonable parameters; a citizen who engages in a legally authorized act should
    not be forced to guess whether his conduct will later be determined to be
    a violation of law. Commonwealth v. Foley, 798 S.W.2d 947, 1990 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 121</cite> (Ky. 1990), overruled in part, Martin v. Commonwealth, 96 S.W.3d 38, 2003 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 8</cite> (Ky. 2003).

    In a criminal trial in which two defendants were convicted of conspiracy to buy votes and vote buying in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. §§ 371 and 1973i(c), the district court did not err in giving a willful blindness jury instruction because there was sufficient evidence that both defendants consciously avoided knowledge of wrongdoing; the district court correctly denied one defendant’s request for a vote hauling instruction because defendant provided no case law to support the theory that transporting voters to the polls pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc119s119.205ol15" target="_self">KRS 119.205(5)</a></cite> included escorting them to the polls, watching them vote, and then escorting them back to another location.

    clerk’s office without reporting what had happened, and the box was found

        Indictment of election officer for making false certificate
    of election need not allege that accused was properly appointed as an election
    officer, but it must allege that he acted as an officer at the election. Indictment
    merely alleging that accused pretendedly acted as a judge of election was
    not sufficient. Commonwealth v. Brown, 123 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 15</cite>, 93 S.W. 605, 29 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 434</cite>, 1906 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 115</cite> (Ky. 1906) (decided

       <p>
        Indictment alleging that accused was duly appointed
    to serve as clerk of election at a certain election in a certain precinct
    was sufficient without alleging when or by whom he was appointed. Commonwealth v. Drewry, 126 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 183</cite>, 103 S.W. 266, 31 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 635</cite>, 1907 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 35</cite> (Ky. 1907) (decided under prior

       <p>
        The fact that the accusatory part of the indictment
    charged the defendant with “forgery” was not a fatal defect, where
    the descriptive part clearly described an offense under former similar section. Wallace v. Commonwealth, 229 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 776</cite>, 18 S.W.2d 290, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 855</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decided under prior

       <p>
        Indictment alleging that defendant willfully altered
    election returns in such a manner as to increase his vote was sufficient without
    alleging that act was done with intent to defraud, and without alleging that
    a named person was intended to be defrauded. Wallace v. Commonwealth, 229 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 776</cite>, 18 S.W.2d 290, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 855</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decided under prior law).

        Indictment alleging that defendant wilfully altered

        Indictment alleging that certificates of returns
    from certain county to secretary of state showed a stated number of votes

        Where it was established that the defendant had the
    motive and the opportunity to change election returns, and that the returns
    were changed by someone to his benefit, there was sufficient evidence to sustain
    a conviction, without positive evidence that defendant did the changing. Wallace v. Commonwealth, 229 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 776</cite>, 18 S.W.2d 290, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 855</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decided under prior

        In prosecution for altering election returns from

        A violation of the corrupt practices act did not
    render the nomination or election ipso facto void, but only void in the event
    of a contest by a defeated candidate. Judd v. Polk, 267 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 408</cite>, 102 S.W.2d 325, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 323</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior law).

        The county clerk could not refuse to place the name
    of a candidate on the ballot for the general election on the ground that the
    candidate violated the corrupt practices act in the primary, where the nomination
    had not been declared void in a contest of the primary. Judd v. Polk, 267 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 408</cite>, 102 S.W.2d 325, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 323</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior law).

        Where the evidence conclusively showed that both
    contestant and contestee violated the corrupt practices act, neither of them
    should be declared elected, but the election should be held void. Johnson v. Hall, 275 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 395</cite>, 121 S.W.2d 935, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 442</cite> (Ky. 1938) (decided under prior

        Where a candidate who received the majority in a
    general election violated the corrupt practices act, the court must declare
    the office vacant and that it be filled in the manner provided by law. Brewer v. Compton, 276 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 53</cite>, 122 S.W.2d 1024, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 532</cite> (Ky. 1938) (decided under prior

        The bribery of one vote was sufficient to void the

        Under the former similar section the election of

        Evidence of vote-buying was not sufficient to invalidate
    election, although it created a strong suspicion that candidate furnished
    the money and it was used on his behalf, when there was no evidence directly
    connecting the candidate with the furnishing or expenditure of the money. Hardin v. Horn, 184 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 548</cite>, 212 S.W. 573, 1919 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 105</cite> (Ky. 1919) (decided under prior

        Use of money to buy votes would not invalidate an

       </p>
       <p>
        The knowledge of a candidate that others have violated
    the corrupt practices act in his behalf may be established by circumstantial
    evidence, but the evidence must do more than merely raise a suspicion, even
    though the suspicion be strong. Douglas v. Greene, 231 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 44</cite>, 20 S.W.2d 1026, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 208</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was not sufficient to establish knowledge
    by candidate of vote-buying, notwithstanding proof that some of money came
    from candidate’s brothers and that chief vote-buyer was campaign manager of
    candidate. Douglas v. Greene, 231 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 44</cite>, 20 S.W.2d 1026, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 208</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decided

       </p>
       <p>
        Bribery by the candidate himself or by others with
    his knowledge could be proved by circumstances, but such evidence must have
    transcended mere suspicion and there must be a reasonable inference of guilty
    knowledge. Hogg v. Combs, 250 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 400</cite>, 63 S.W.2d 465, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 701</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided

       </p>
       <p>
        Proof of open and widespread vote-buying by contestee’s
    supporters held sufficient to establish contestee’s knowledge. Mounts v. Hatfield, 250 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 727</cite>, 63 S.W.2d 928, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 766</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Bribery of voters was not sufficient to deprive candidate
    of nomination unless it was proved that the bribing was done by the candidate,
    or that he had knowledge that the bribing would be or was being done and ratified
    it affirmatively or by acquiescence. Prewitt v. Caudill, 250 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 698</cite>, 63 S.W.2d 954, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 778</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence held insufficient to establish knowledge
    of candidate that others were buying votes for him, notwithstanding that his
    sons were participating in the buying and meetings to discuss distribution
    of funds were held in candidate’s home and offices. Prewitt v. Caudill, 250 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 698</cite>, 63 S.W.2d 954, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 778</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of a concerted plan or scheme to bribe voters,
    and of bribery by candidate’s wife, was sufficient to establish candidate’s
    knowledge. Howard v. Whittaker, 250 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 836</cite>, 64 S.W.2d 173, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 793</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided

       </p>
       <p>
        Knowledge by a candidate of corrupt practices by
    others in his behalf could be proved by showing that he committed, consented
    to, or authorized others to commit, or personally observed the commission
    by others of, an act or acts in violation of the corrupt practices act, or
    by showing facts and circumstances surrounding the candidate and his workers
    during the period of preparation for the day of election, as well as on the
    election day. Howard v. Whittaker, 250 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 836</cite>, 64 S.W.2d 173, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 793</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of the actions and conduct of the workers,
    their private meetings with the candidate, their association or relation to
    him, their reputations of engaging in corrupt practices in other elections,
    and evidence of the actions and conduct of the candidate before and on the
    day of the election, and his reputation as to corrupt practices in other elections,
    was competent on the question of the candidate’s knowledge of bribery of voters
    by others on his behalf. Howard v. Whittaker, 250 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 836</cite>, 64 S.W.2d 173, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 793</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Elections should not be set aside unless facts show
    corrupt practices act was violated by candidate, or by others with his knowledge
    or sanction. Wheeler v. Marshall, 280 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 55</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 519, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 58</cite> (Ky. 1939) (decided

       </p>
       <p>
        Knowledge of misconduct could be inferred from circumstances,
    but the candidate was not liable for improper actions on the part of supporters
    and relatives in the absence of showing such fraudulent actions were authorized
    or ratified upon the part of the candidate. Wheeler v. Marshall, 280 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 55</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 519, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 58</cite> (Ky. 1939) (decided under prior law).

       </p>
       <p>
        Closeness of association of candidate with those
    violating act on his behalf may impute knowledge on his part, where the acts
    were brazen and repeated. Davisworth v. Middleton, 288 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 77</cite>, 155 S.W.2d 450, 1941 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 45</cite> (Ky. 1941) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before one may be deprived of office or nomination
    because of alleged violation of the act it must be shown by convincing evidence
    that the one charged must himself have violated its provisions, or that it
    was violated by another with his knowledge, consent or procurement. Hoskins v. Turner, 288 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 72</cite>, 155 S.W.2d 486, 1941 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 53</cite> (Ky. 1941) (decided under prior

        Judgment in action for recount that stated that the

    of illegal votes and corrupt practice violations. Wright v. Crase, 274 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 628</cite>, 119 S.W.2d 858, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 308</cite> (Ky. 1938) (decided under prior law).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any candidate for nomination to office at a primary held under the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.015" target="_self">KRS 118.015</a></cite> to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.035" target="_self">118.035 </a></cite>and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.105" target="_self">118.105 </a></cite>to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc118s118.255" target="_self">118.255,</a></cite> or any candidate for nomination to a city office at a primary for which the statutes do not otherwise provide for determining contest elections, for whom a number of votes was cast equal to not less than fifty percent (50%) of the votes cast for the successful candidate for nomination to the office, may contest the right of the successful candidate, and of any other candidate for nomination to the office, to the nomination, by filing a petition in the Circuit Court within ten (10) days from the day of the primary, stating the specific grounds relied upon for the contest, and causing a summons to be issued, returnable in seven (7) days. In the case of candidates for offices for the state at large, the petition shall be filed in the Franklin Circuit Court; in the case of other candidates it shall be filed in the Circuit Court of the county in which the contestee resides. The summons may be personally served on the contestee in any county, or it may be served by leaving a copy at his or her home with a member of his or her family over sixteen (16) years of age, or by posting a copy on the door of his or her residence. The contestee shall file his or her answer within seven (7) days after service of summons. The answer may contain grounds of contest in favor of the contestee and against the contestant, but the grounds shall be specifically set out. Any candidate who would have been qualified to bring a contest action under this section, who is a party to a recount proceeding brought under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc120s120.095" target="_self">KRS 120.095</a></cite>, may, by filing an answer in the recount proceeding within the time allowed by this section for filing grounds of contest, set forth grounds of contest against the petitioner in the recount proceeding. No ground of contest by either party shall be filed or made more definite by amendment after the expiration of the time allowed by this section for filing the original pleading. The contestant may file a reply within five (5) days after answer is filed, which shall complete the pleading, and any affirmative matter in the reply shall be treated as controverted. Upon return of the summons, properly executed, to the office of the circuit clerk of the county in which the action is pending, the clerk shall immediately docket the cause and notify the presiding judge of the court that the contest has been instituted, and the judge shall proceed to a trial of the cause within five (5) days after the issue was joined. In judicial circuits having more than one (1) Circuit Judge, the judge who shall hear the cause shall be determined by lot.

    from the provisions of the chapter. Thompson v. Kenton County Board of Election Com., 535 S.W.2d 68, 1975 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 4</cite> (Ky. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1083, 96 S. Ct. 873, 47 L. Ed. 2d 94, 1976 U.S. LEXIS 1215 (U.S. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to contest a primary election is not inherent,
    but is given and controlled by statute. Brumleve v. Cronan, 176 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 818</cite>, 197 S.W. 498, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 134</cite> (Ky. 1917). See Hall v.

       </p>
       <p>
        If recount proceeding only was instituted before
    certificate of nomination had been issued, a separate contest proceeding could
    thereafter be instituted. Kincaid v. Hurst, 287 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 824</cite>, 155 S.W.2d 225, 1941 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 642</cite> (Ky. 1941) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Where illegal votes constituted a ground of contest,
    the petition had to allege the names of the illegal voters and the precinct
    in which they voted; contestant could not introduce proof as to illegal votes
    under a general allegation as to illegal voting by persons unknown. Weller v. Muenninghoff, 155 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 77</cite>, 159 S.W. 632, 1913 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 191</cite> (Ky. 1913) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Allegation of petition that “an accurate, fair
    and impartial count” of the ballots would show that contestant received
    more votes than contestee was sufficient to authorize a recount, it being
    unnecessary to use the words “mistake,” “oversight”
    or “fraud” in charging an erroneous count. Thurman v. Alvey, 192 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 341</cite>, 233 S.W. 749, 1921 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 63</cite> (Ky. 1921) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where illegal votes are made a ground of contest,
    the petition must allege the names of the voters and the facts which made
    their votes illegal. Thurman v. Alvey, 192 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 341</cite>, 233 S.W. 749, 1921 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 63</cite> (Ky. 1921). See Combs v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Allegation that contestee formed a pool with other
    candidates for purpose of bribing voters, and that large sum was contributed
    and used for bribery, was not sufficient where the names of the other candidates,
    the names of the persons bribed, the method of bribing, and the precincts
    where the bribery was committed were not alleged. Owsley v. Hill, 210 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 285</cite>, 275 S.W. 797, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 661</cite> (Ky. 1925) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where facts alleged in petition showed that contestant
    had necessary qualifications for office, it was not necessary that eligibility
    be alleged in specific terms. Bingham v. Smith, 210 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 256</cite>, 275 S.W. 811, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 655</cite> (Ky. 1925) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not necessary for contestant to allege that
    his nomination papers were properly filed; it was sufficient if he alleged
    that he was a candidate and his name regularly appeared on the ballot. Bingham v. Smith, 210 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 256</cite>, 275 S.W. 811, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 655</cite> (Ky. 1925) (decided under prior
    law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition alleging illegal voting in certain precincts
    was not sufficient unless it further alleged that the throwing out of the
    illegal votes would give the contestant a plurality of the remaining votes. Baker v. Colson, 210 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 277</cite>, 275 S.W. 879, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 659</cite> (Ky. 1925) (decided under prior
    law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition alleging that contestee conspired with others
    to bribe voters, and that pursuant to such conspiracy voters and election
    officers were bribed, was sufficient, without alleging names and number of
    persons bribed. Humbert v. Heyburn, 240 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 405</cite>, 42 S.W.2d 538, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 422</cite> (Ky. 1931) (decided
    under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        An allegation that contestee violated the Corrupt
    Practices Act by bribing voters was sufficient without setting out the names
    of voters bribed or their number, or other details or particulars. Goad v. Jackson, 270 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 92</cite>, 109 S.W.2d 17, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        Petition alleging that candidate for tax commissioner
    entered into a conspiracy with other candidates for the purpose of committing
    fraud, and that the candidate contributed $4,000 which was used for buying
    votes in violation of the Corrupt Practices Act, and that more than 600 votes
    were bought, sufficiently stated a cause of action, although the names of
    the bribed voters were not given and the petition referred to sections of
    the Corrupt Practices Act having no bearing on the alleged violations. Goad v. Jackson, 270 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 92</cite>, 109 S.W.2d 17, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 25</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        The successful candidate may initiate contest proceedings
    as soon as his prima facie status is attacked by the unsuccessful party in
    recount proceedings. Moore v. Stephenson, 279 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 780</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 316, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 357</cite> (Ky. 1939) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Voter could not institute contest for violation of
    Corrupt Practices Act; such right was conferred only on defeated candidates. Davis v. Stahl, 287 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 629</cite>, 154 S.W.2d 736, 1941 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 607</cite> (Ky. 1941) (decided under prior

        In filing an election contest based upon the casting
    of individual illegal votes, the contestant must allege for whom each of the
    identified illegal voters cast his ballot. Coomer v. Tamme, 777 S.W.2d 607, 1989 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 120</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1989).

        Where a petition contesting a primary election alleged
    that 55 individuals voted in that election although they were not eligible
    to do so, but where it did not identify for whom the illegal voters had cast

        There is no inherent power in the courts to pass
    upon the validity of elections or to try contested elections; their authority
    is wholly statutory and must be either given expressly or by necessary implication. Pflanz v. Foster, 155 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 15</cite>, 159 S.W. 641, 1913 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        In election contest, court acquired jurisdiction
    of the subject-matter when the petition was filed and it could proceed with
    the trial of the case as soon as it acquired jurisdiction over the person
    of the contestee, and such jurisdiction could be acquired by service of process
    on him or by his voluntary appearance and submission. Hudson v. Manning, 250 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 760</cite>, 63 S.W.2d 943, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 774</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided under prior law).

        Upon the return of the summons the clerk should immediately
    notify the judge, and the judge should proceed to a trial within five (5)
    days after issue is joined, but a failure of either to perform such duty would

     <p>
      Each party to a contest instituted
    under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc120s120.055" target="_self">KRS 120.055</a></cite> shall be entitled, in the production of evidence to be used
    on the trial thereof, to all the remedies allowed in cases at law and in equity.
    In trying the contest the court shall hear and determine all questions of
    law and fact without the intervention of a jury, and may examine the witnesses
    orally or require or permit the parties to take the evidence by depositions.
    If the evidence is taken orally either party may require it to be taken by
    the official reporter for the court, to be taken and transcribed and paid
    for as evidence in other civil actions. The court may require the contestant,
    or the person who has the burden of proof under the issue joined, to complete
    his proof in not less than fifteen (15) days after service of summons, and
    the contestee, or the person not having the burden, to complete his proof
    in not less than ten (10) days after filing an answer. Each party may be given
    one (1) day additional for producing evidence in rebuttal and no greater time
    shall be extended, unless the court is satisfied that the ends of justice
    demand it. The court shall, immediately after the evidence is concluded, consider
    the contest and determine it. If it appears from an inspection of the whole
    record that there has been such fraud, intimidation, bribery or violence in
    the conduct of the election that neither contestant nor contestee can be adjudged
    to have been fairly nominated, the court may adjudge that there has been no
    election, in which event the nomination shall be deemed vacant. The judgment
    of the court shall be filed in the office of the Circuit Court clerk.

       <p>
        Evidence showing that a number of illegal votes in
    excess of the contestee’s majority were cast in the election, but not showing
    for whom such votes were cast, would not authorize the court to declare the
    election void or to declare the contestant nominated. Taylor v. Weir, 155 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 72</cite>, 159 S.W. 646, 1913 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 194</cite> (Ky. 1913).

       <p>
        Where there was no evidence of general fraud, coercion,
    intimidation, bribery or illegal practices, the mere fact that three illegal
    votes were cast in one precinct, the election officers in another precinct
    failed to mark the fact of voting on the registration records, the election
    officers in another precinct marked the registration records as though all
    registered voters had voted, mistakes were made in adding up the votes in
    some precincts, and the ballot boxes in some precincts were stolen after the
    canvass of returns was completed, was not sufficient to require that the entire
    election be held void. Ferguson v. Gregory, 216 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 382</cite>, 287 S.W. 952, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 935</cite> (Ky. 1926) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of stuffing of ballot box, open voting,
    voting of unqualified and nonexistent persons, and interference with legal
    voters, was sufficient to justify throwing out entire vote of precinct. Hatcher v. Petry, 261 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 52</cite>, 86 S.W.2d 1043, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 587</cite> (Ky. 1935) (decided under prior

        Where four voters were not permitted to vote in an

        Where it was possible to determine for whom illegal

    precinct, the entire vote of the precinct would not be thrown out because
    of illegal voting or ballot-box stuffing. Kash v. Hurst, 189 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 233</cite>, 224 S.W. 757, 1920 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 408</cite> (Ky. 1920) (decided under prior law).

        Where names of illegal voters could be determined

       </p>
       <p>
        Before a contestant was entitled to have the vote
    of an entire precinct thrown out he had to make some attempt to purge the

        Where court required that proof be taken by depositions

    could not be deducted from either candidate. Kash v. Hurst, 189 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 233</cite>, 224 S.W. 757, 1920 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 408</cite> (Ky. 1920) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Where it was shown that eight illegal votes were
    cast in one precinct, and contestant had received only three votes in that
    precinct, five of the illegal votes were properly deducted from contestee’s
    total, but in absence of proof as to how ballots were voted the remaining
    three could not be deducted from contestant. Kash v. Hurst, 189 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 233</cite>, 224 S.W. 757, 1920 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 408</cite> (Ky. 1920) (decided under prior law).

        Contestant seeking recount had to establish by proof
    that the ballots had been so preserved that they could be accepted as the
    best evidence of the result of the election. Ferguson v. Gregory, 216 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 382</cite>, 287 S.W. 952, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 935</cite> (Ky. 1926) (decided under prior law).

        Where no proof was taken because court decided case
    on demurrer, and case was reversed and remanded by Court of Appeals, proof
    could then be taken in such time as the court allows. Damron v. Johnson, 192 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 350</cite>, 233 S.W. 745, 1921 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 60</cite> (Ky. 1921) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of an order of court limiting the
    time within which the parties had to complete their proof, there was no limit
    upon the time within which proof could be taken. Charles v. Flanary, 192 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 511</cite>, 233 S.W. 904, 1921 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 88</cite> (Ky. 1921) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        If the nature of the case was such that the taking
    of proof could be completed in a shorter period than 15 days for the contestant
    and ten days for the contestee, the court could and should limit the time
    to a shorter period. Charles v. Flanary, 192 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 511</cite>, 233 S.W. 904, 1921 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 88</cite> (Ky. 1921) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        If the court was in vacation when the contest was
    filed, and for some reason the judge did not call the case for trial until
    the next regular term, the parties were not required to take their proof in
    the meantime, but upon the convening of the court the contestant should request
    the judge to give directions as to the time and manner of taking proof, and
    if he failed to make such request the case could be dismissed for want of
    prosecution. Seals v. Elam, 240 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 485</cite>, 42 S.W.2d 700, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 429</cite> (Ky. 1931).

       <p>
        Where circuit clerk deliberately absented himself
    from his office, so that appellant could not execute supersedeas bond before
    him on day after judgment, appellant could have executed bond on following
    day, but attempt to execute bond before clerk of Court of Appeals was not
    proper. Ward v. Howard, 177 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 38</cite>, 197 S.W. 506, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 537</cite> (Ky. 1917) (decided

       </p>
       <p>
        If the appellant was prevented from executing the
    supersedeas bond within the required time by unavoidable casualty or misfortune,
    or by accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded
    against, or by circumstances beyond his control, he could execute the bond
    on the following day. Ward v. Howard, 177 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 38</cite>, 197 S.W. 506, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 537</cite> (Ky. 1917). See Johnson v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Supersedeas bond had to be executed before the circuit

       </p>
       <p>
        Where there were several contest suits involving
    different county offices, a separate supersedeas bond was necessary in each
    suit, although the suits were tried together in the Circuit Court for the
    purpose of convenience. Milliken v. Hatter, 177 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 31</cite>, 197 S.W. 511, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 538</cite> (Ky. 1917) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provision of the former similar section as to
    the time of executing supersedeas bond was mandatory, and had to be complied
    within the absence of casualty or misfortune or circumstances beyond control
    of appellant. Williams v. Ezzel, 210 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 213</cite>, 275 S.W. 783, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 648</cite> (Ky. 1925).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where clerk and deputies were absent from office
    on day following entry of judgment, execution of supersedeas bond on following
    day was sufficient compliance. Johnson v. Caddell, 251 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 14</cite>, 64 S.W.2d 441, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 807</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction of an appeal
    from a judgment in a primary election contest unless a supersedeas bond had
    been executed before the clerk of the Circuit Court. Wheeler v. Rea, 306 S.W.2d 294, 1957 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 42</cite> (Ky. 1957) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The filing of the supersedeas bond on the day required
    by the former similar section was mandatory unless the contestant made a showing
    of casualty, misfortune or circumstances beyond his control sufficient to
    justify excusing the dereliction. Wheeler v. Rea, 306 S.W.2d 294, 1957 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 42</cite> (Ky. 1957) (decided under prior law).

        Since a supersedeas bond in an appeal of an election

        Where appellant filed schedule with clerk, directing
    him to transmit original papers to Court of Appeals, together with “such
    transcript of testimony as may be filed with you,” without designating
    the specific parts of the transcript to be transmitted, and the clerk therefore

        The former provision that, upon an appeal from a
    contest, the clerk shall “immediately” transmit the papers in
    the case to the clerk of the Court of Appeals, did not mean “instantly”
    or “forthwith,” but rather meant “without unnecessary delay,”
    or “with due diligence under the circumstances.” The limitation
    of ten days for an appeal from a recount judgment indicated that the general
    assembly considered ten days a reasonable time. Austin v. Anderson, 279 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 742</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 56, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 345</cite> (Ky. 1939) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        In determining whether the original papers in an
    election contest case were transmitted to the Court of Appeals “immediately”
    after the execution of the supersedeas bond, the date of the contest judgment,
    and not the date when the count of votes was ascertained by the court, was
    controlling. Austin v. Anderson, 279 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 742</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 56, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 345</cite> (Ky. 1939) (decided

       <p>
        The court suggests that where there is a question
    as to decision of Circuit Court as to integrity of ballots, the ballot boxes
    should be transmitted to the Court of Appeals as part of the record on appeal. Ferguson v. Gregory, 216 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 382</cite>, 287 S.W. 952, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 935</cite> (Ky. 1926) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Both in contest and recount proceedings, before ballot
    box could be opened for recount, applicant had to prove that box had been
    kept as required by law and that ballots had not been tampered with. Jenkins v. Martin, 287 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 557</cite>, 154 S.W.2d 242, 1941 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 578</cite> (Ky. 1941) (decided under prior
    law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before a ballot box could be opened and the ballots
    recounted, the one seeking the recount had to prove satisfactorily that the
    ballot box had been kept as the law requires, and that the ballots had not
    been tampered with. Rose v. Shotwell, 300 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 556</cite>, 189 S.W.2d 855, 1945 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 600</cite> (Ky. 1945) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the court was authorized to recount the ballots
    it had to be shown with reasonable certainty that the boxes had been protected
    and the ballots had been preserved in the condition they were in when counted
    originally by the board of election commissioners. Ashcraft v. Edmondson, 242 S.W.2d 635, 1951 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1063</cite> (Ky. 1951) (decided under prior law).

        The person seeking a recount had the burden of establishing

       </p>
       <p>
        Action of trial court in overruling contestant’s
    motion for a recount was not prejudicial where it did not deprive contestant
    of the right to introduce evidence as to the integrity of the ballots, and
    the evidence he introduced was not sufficient to establish their integrity. Ferguson v. Gregory, 216 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 382</cite>, 287 S.W. 952, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 935</cite> (Ky. 1926) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Recount should be denied and official tabulation
    should stand, where, despite evidence justifying holding that prima facie
    case for integrity of ballots had been proved, evidence and ballots themselves
    showed that, after count by election commissioners, access had been gained
    to ballot box in certain precinct and unsigned ballots substituted for ballots
    cast. Jenkins v. Martin, 287 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 557</cite>, 154 S.W.2d 242, 1941 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 578</cite> (Ky. 1941) (decided

       </p>
       <p>
        The integrity of the ballots had to be proved, but
    pleading the integrity of the ballots was not necessary. Howard v. Rowland, 261 S.W.2d 280, 1953 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 996</cite> (Ky. 1953) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden was on the contestant to establish the
    integrity of the ballots, the requirement in that respect had to be reasonable
    and it was incumbent upon him only to prove circumstances from which a logical
    inference could be deduced that the ballot boxes and their contents had not
    been disturbed. Monroe v. Graves County Board of Election Comm'rs, 293 S.W.2d 725, 1956 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 90</cite> (Ky. 1956) (decided

        Where there was no evidence of actual tampering,
    a recount was granted, although ballot boxes had been stored part of time
    in a second-floor room of courthouse which could have been broken into, and
    part of time on floor of clerk’s main office where persons came and went during
    the day, and boxes had cheap locks, where it was established that the clerk
    kept a proper guard over the boxes. Roby v. Croan, 177 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 9</cite>, 197 S.W. 456, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 534</cite> (Ky. 1917) (decided under prior law).

        A recount would not be granted unless it fairly appeared

    care had been exercised to prevent a violation of their sanctity. Roby v. Croan, 177 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 9</cite>, 197 S.W. 456, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 534</cite> (Ky. 1917) (decided under prior

        Where ballot boxes, after canvass by election commissioners,
    were stored in basement room of courthouse which could be entered by open
    window, some of the boxes were stolen, the boxes had ten-cent padlocks, and
    several election seals were in hands of interested parties, the integrity
    of ballots was not established, although there was no evidence of actual tampering

       <p>
        Evidence that ballot boxes were stored in a room,
    which was kept locked and was guarded at all times by the county clerk or
    his deputy and by representatives of both parties, satisfactorily showed the
    integrity of the ballots, and authorized recount proceedings, though there
    was some very remote possibility that someone might have entered the room,
    and some of the guards did not testify in the recount proceedings. Austin v. Anderson, 279 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 742</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 56, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 345</cite> (Ky. 1939) (decided under prior

        Allegation of petition that “an accurate, fair

    unnecessary to use the words “mistake,” “oversight”

        This statute could not be more clear in pointing
    out the importance of quick decision-making in an election contest; the statute
    specifically states that the court shall complete the case as soon as practicable
    and that this action shall take precedence over all other cases. Clark v. Mason, 596 S.W.2d 16, 1979 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 517</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).

       <p>
        Where city charter provided that contests involving
    city offices “shall be decided as may be provided by ordinance,”
    but it appeared that city had never passed an ordinance governing contests,
    there was no “other provision made by law” within the meaning
    of the former similar section and the Circuit Court had jurisdiction of contest
    for office of police judge. Lyttle v. Wilson, 252 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 392</cite>, 67 S.W.2d 498, 1934 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 791</cite> (Ky. 1934) (decided under prior law).

    of such voters were set forth in contestant’s petition. Francis v. Sturgill, 163 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 650</cite>, 174 S.W. 753, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        The contestant, in his petition, need not negative
    the fact that illegal votes were received by him, or affirmatively allege
    that all of the votes received by him were legal votes. Rose v. Cecil, 167 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 608</cite>, 181 S.W. 170, 1916 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 445</cite> (Ky. 1916) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        In order to have illegal votes deducted from the
    contestee’s vote it was indispensably necessary for the contestant to set
    out in his pleading the names of the illegal voters and for whom their votes
    were cast. WATTS v. FUGATE, 442 S.W.2d 569, 1969 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 271</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1969) (decided

        Answer alleging that illegal votes were cast for

    certificate of election, contestant could not be adjudged to have been elected
    in the absence of allegations of facts in his petition showing that he received

        The closing sentence of the former similar section

        The contestant could amend his petition to enlarge

        Where answer setting up grounds of counter contest

In that event the office shall be deemed vacant, with the same legal effect as if the person elected had refused to qualify. If one (1) of the parties is adjudged by the court to be elected to the office, he or she shall, on production of a copy of the final judgment, be permitted to qualify or be commissioned.

        The statutes governing election contests are mandatory

        Where the mechanical failure in the tabulation of

        The fraud contemplated by this section is not limited

    as constructive fraud which arises through some breach of a legal duty which,
    irrespective of moral guilt, the law would pronounce fraudulent because of
    its tendency to deceive others, to violate confidence, or to injure public
    interests. Wood v. Kirby, 566 S.W.2d 751, 1978 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 364</cite> (Ky. 1978).

       <p>
        Proof that a voter was a member of a certain party
    was competent evidence on the question of how he voted. Tunks v. Vincent, 106 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 829</cite>, 51 S.W. 622, 21 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 475</cite>, 1899 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 111</cite> (Ky. 1899) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Where there was evidence that certain illegal voter
    was a Republican, and, when Democratic contestant sought to secure his testimony
    as to how he voted, counsel for Republican contestee objected, evidence was
    sufficient to support finding that such voter had voted for contestee. Tunks v. Vincent, 106 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 829</cite>, 51 S.W. 622, 21 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 475</cite>, 1899 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 111</cite> (Ky. 1899) (decided under prior

       <p>
        Where ballots were offered in evidence, the opposing
    party had the right to introduce evidence showing that the ballots had been
    tampered with since the election, although the time prescribed by former similar
    section for taking proof had expired. Galloway v. Bradburn, 119 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 49</cite>, 82 S.W. 1013, 26 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 977</cite>, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 144</cite> (Ky. 1904) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Where election of school board member was being held
    at same time as election for other offices, and there was a separate school
    ballot, the fact that the school ballots ran out at 3 p.m. and that a number
    of persons presented themselves to vote after that time was not grounds for
    declaring the school election void, without proof by contestant that persons
    who voted after 3 p.m. were qualified and desired to vote the school ballot
    and that they were sufficient in number to change the result of the election. Drennan v. Roberts, 234 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 574</cite>, 28 S.W.2d 735, 1930 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 218</cite> (Ky. 1930) (decided under prior

        Where it appeared that contestant was instrumental
    in having certain illegal voter vote, and contestant objected to admission
    of testimony of such voter as to how he voted, court was justified in concluding
    that such voter voted for contestant. Land v. Land, 244 <cite class="ocky"></cite>, 50 S.W.2d 518, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 720</cite> (Ky. 1931) (decided under prior law).

        Where, at the conclusion of the defendant’s evidence,
    the plaintiffs stated they had no rebuttal evidence at that time, the court,
    in its discretion, properly ordered plaintiffs’ case closed, even though they
    insisted on seven-day period allowed by subsection (2) of former similar section. Johnson v. May, 307 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 399</cite>, 211 S.W.2d 135, 1948 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 742</cite> (Ky. 1948) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (2) of former similar section permitted
    the introduction of rebuttal evidence in election contests within seven (7)
    days after contestee had concluded, but did not permit the contestant to introduce,
    by way of rebuttal, testimony concerning the votes of certain persons about
    whose votes no testimony had been offered in chief. Gross v. Helton, 267 S.W.2d 67, 1954 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 824</cite> (Ky. 1954) (decided under prior law).

        Ballots may be examined by court and treated as evidence

        Agreement between contestant and contestee, extending

        Order of court submitting case and overruling contestee’s

    what additional time he desired or what proof he would offer. Allen v. Haddix, 178 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 389</cite>, 198 S.W. 1155, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 737</cite> (Ky. 1917) (decided under prior law).

        Contestant had to take his proof within the time

    acted on demurrer to answer and motion to strike filed by contestant. Buten v. Clark, 217 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 436</cite>, 289 S.W. 677, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 97</cite> (Ky. 1926) (decided under prior

       <p>
        In the case of illegal votes cast openly, the contestant
    must prove, by the election officers or the voter, for whom they were cast,
    and when such proof is made they will be deducted from the candidate for whom
    they were cast. Scholl v. Bell, 125 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 750</cite>, 102 S.W. 248, 31 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 335</cite>, 1907 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 328</cite> (Ky. 1907) (decided

       <p>
        Illegal ballots secretly cast might be relied on
    to show the general uncertainty of an election, without proving for whom they

       </p>
       <p>
        In order to deduct illegal votes from a candidate’s
    total, it had to be shown that they were cast and counted for him, but it
    could be shown by circumstantial evidence how they were cast. Scholl v. Bell, 125 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 750</cite>, 102 S.W. 248, 31 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 335</cite>, 1907 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 328</cite> (Ky. 1907) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        If all illegal votes were deducted from contestee’s
    total, although it was not proved that they were all cast for contestee, and
    contestee still had a majority, his election could not be disturbed. Felts v. Edwards, 181 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 287</cite>, 204 S.W. 145 (Ky. 1918). See Muncy v.

       <p>
        Where the number of votes received by one candidate
    in a certain precinct is less than the number of illegal votes proved to have
    been cast in that precinct, the excess of illegal votes over the number of
    votes received by such candidate might have been deducted from the other candidate,
    without proof that they were cast for the latter. Siler v. Brown, 215 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 199</cite>, 284 S.W. 997, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Although 20 percent or more of the votes of a precinct
    were cast after closing time, yet, if the names of the voters could be ascertained
    and it could be determined for whom they voted, the election would not be
    declared void, but the votes would be deducted from the total of the candidate
    for whom they were cast. Hogg v. Caudill, 254 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 409</cite>, 71 S.W.2d 1020, 1934 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 105</cite> (Ky. 1934) (decided under prior law).

    cast in alphabetical blocks, that the ballots must have been cast by the election
    officers, and that the election officers had openly supported the two contestees,
    the court was justified in concluding that all of the 90 illegal ballots were
    cast for the contestees and that this number should be deducted from their
    totals, rather than throwing out the entire precinct on the ground of fraud. Hendrickson v. Coign, 304 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 383</cite>, 200 S.W.2d 905, 1947 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 644</cite> (Ky. 1947) (decided under prior

        The fact that contestant and his adherents were also
    guilty of bribery would not prevent election being declared void where bribery
    by both sides was so widespread that neither party could be adjudged to have

        When it appeared that in the entire election voters
    had been bribed in a number largely in excess of the majority received by
    the successful candidate, the election might be declared void without proving
    that bribery in any one precinct was sufficient to void the election in that
    precinct. Butler v. Roberson, 158 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 101</cite>, 164 S.W. 340, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 575</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided

        The amount of money used to corrupt an election was
    not necessarily a controlling factor in determining whether the election should
    have been set aside; it was the wholesale use of money rather than the amount

        Where, in election for magistrate, each side spent

        Proof that opposing parties in city election in Lexington

        Where evidence showed that men known to be active
    election workers were present at polls with money, and that persons known
    to be purchasable voters were also present, and that such workers and voters
    were seen together under circumstances reasonably creating belief that money
    was being promised or paid, a strong inference of bribery arose. Butler v. Roberson, 158 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 101</cite>, 164 S.W. 340, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 575</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior

        In order to set election aside on ground of bribery
    it was not necessary to establish the exact number of voters who were bribed
    or what sum was paid to bribe them. Evidence as to widespread use of money
    to bribe voters was sufficient without positive evidence of each individual
    act. Butler v. Roberson, 158 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 101</cite>, 164 S.W. 340, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 575</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided

        Where, in election for county officers in Pike County,
    evidence showed that one party spent $14,000 on election day, and the other
    party spent $6,000, and there was ample evidence of widespread bribery by
    both sides, election was declared void, although contestant did not establish
    specific instances of bribery in number sufficient to affect result. Ford v. Hopkins, 141 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 181</cite>, 132 S.W. 542, 1910 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 448</cite> (Ky. 1910) (decided under prior

        Requirement that bond be executed within 30 days
    was mandatory, and if bond was not executed and filed within that time the
    Court of Appeals could not take jurisdiction. Patterson v. Davis, 114 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 77</cite>, 70 S.W. 47, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L.

       <p>
        Bond executed by contestee on appeal from judgment
    in favor of contestant was insufficient where it was conditioned only to pay
    such damages as might be “adjudged against contestee on the appeal,”
    and that contestee would perform the judgment if affirmed. Galloway v. Bradburn, 119 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 49</cite>, 82 S.W. 1013, 26 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 977</cite>, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 144</cite> (Ky. 1904) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Appeal bond was not valid unless it was executed
    before the circuit clerk and bore his indorsement so showing. Philips v. Robinson, 225 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 682</cite>, 9 S.W.2d 995, 1928 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 840</cite> (Ky. 1928) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal bond conditioned only that appellant would
    “perform the judgment of the court” was fatally defective. Barker v. Blankenship, 271 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 213</cite>, 111 S.W.2d 592, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 204</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal bond naming no obligee was fatally defective. Barker v. Blankenship, 271 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 213</cite>, 111 S.W.2d 592, 1937 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 204</cite> (Ky. 1937) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal bond, which named no obligee and was not conditioned
    for payment of all costs and damages appellee might sustain, was fatally defective. Kinner v. Zachem, 273 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 758</cite>, 117 S.W.2d 943, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 711</cite> (Ky. 1938) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal bond had to be executed before circuit clerk,
    and not in the Court of Appeals.
    Kinner v. Zachem, 273 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 758</cite>, 117 S.W.2d 943, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 711</cite> (Ky. 1938) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The appeal bond had to be executed and approved within
    30 days from the rendition of the judgment, and before the record was filed. Stafford v. Bailey, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 528</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 999, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 201</cite> (Ky. 1940) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of former statute that a bond be
    executed was mandatory and jurisdictional, and could not be dispensed with. Stafford v. Bailey, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 525</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 998, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 200</cite> (Ky. 1940) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Where no appeal bond was filed, the Court of Appeals
    had no jurisdiction. Stafford v. Bailey, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 528</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 999, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 201</cite> (Ky. 1940) (decided under prior law).

        2.— Defective.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where appeal bond was executed within prescribed
    time, but was defective, appellant was permitted to file an amended bond in
    the Court of Appeals correcting the defect. Galloway v. Bradburn, 119 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 49</cite>, 82 S.W. 1013, 26 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 977</cite>, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 144</cite> (Ky. 1904) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Where original bond was defective, but a second bond
    fully complying with the statute was executed and filed within the 30-day
    period, the appeal was properly perfected. Johnson v. Little, 176 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 505</cite>, 196 S.W. 156, 1917 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 90</cite> (Ky. 1917) (decided under prior law).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The supersedeas bond had to be conditioned for payment
    of all costs and damages the appellee could sustain by reason of the appeal. Galloway v. Bradburn, 119 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 49</cite>, 82 S.W. 1013, 26 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 977</cite>, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 144</cite> (Ky. 1904) (decided under prior
    law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where contestant was successful in Circuit Court,
    execution of supersedeas bond by contestee had the effect of keeping the contestant
    out of the office pending the appeal. Galloway v. Bradburn, 119 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 49</cite>, 82 S.W. 1013, 26 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 977</cite>, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 144</cite> (Ky. 1904) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where supersedeas was filed on appeal from judgment
    declaring election void and office vacant, judgment did not become final and
    no vacancy existed until affirmed on appeal. Ball v. Cawood, 275 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 108</cite>, 120 S.W.2d 776, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 373</cite> (Ky. 1938) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to issue
    a mandatory writ to compel a Circuit Court clerk to approve an appeal bond
    in an election contest case. Stafford v. Bailey, 282 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 528</cite>, 138 S.W.2d 999, 1940 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 201</cite> (Ky. 1940) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supersedeas bond must be specific, and an appeal
    will not be effective as to any party not named in the bond as an obligee. Kelly v. Shacklette, 290 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 430</cite>, 161 S.W.2d 612, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 412</cite> (Ky. 1942) (decided under prior

        Where action was designated in petition as a proceeding

        Affidavit of appellant to effect that record would
    amount to more than 1,400 pages and it would be impossible to copy it within
    30 days was not sufficient to warrant extension of time, where it was not

        The only purpose of a recount was to ascertain the
    correctness of the numerical result certified, and thus where contestant alleged
    that ballots were lost, stolen and misplaced, mutilated or spoiled in sufficient
    number to have changed result of election, he was not entitled to a recount,
    since recount would be useless. Burd v. Meadows, 276 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 306</cite>, 124 S.W.2d 85, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 517</cite> (Ky. 1939) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Where the ballots had been so exposed so as to have
    offered opportunity to be tampered with, and had not been guarded with such
    care as to remove all suspicion of substitution or change, they could not
    be relied on in a contest or recount proceeding. Edwards v. Logan, 114 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 312</cite>, 70 S.W. 852, 75 S.W. 257, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L.

       </p>
       <p>
        A recount would not be granted where it appeared
    that the ballots had been changed, or so exposed as to afford opportunity
    to be tampered with, or left in the custody of an officer or person so personally
    interested in the result of the election as to be subject to the temptation
    or inducement to tamper with them. Scholl v. Bell, 125 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 750</cite>, 102 S.W. 248, 31 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 335</cite>, 1907 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 328</cite> (Ky. 1907) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        The real test in determining whether a recount would
    be granted was whether the ballots had been preserved in such manner as to
    insure their integrity, and whether they had apparently been tampered with. Potter v. Campbell, 159 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 328</cite>, 167 S.W. 404, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 810</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        Order of court directing that a recount be made was
    purely interlocutory, and court could set aside the order after the recount
    had been made and reject the report of the commissioners who made the recount,
    on the ground that the integrity of the ballots had not been established. Craft v. Davidson, 189 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 378</cite>, 224 S.W. 1082, 1920 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 436</cite> (Ky. 1920) (decided under prior

        If it appeared that the boxes had been properly safeguarded,
    the fact that some boxes bore evidence of tampering would not prevent the

        The trial judge should never reserve his ruling on

        The party who desired a recount must have tendered,
    in connection with his petition for the recount, evidence that the boxes had
    been carefully preserved and not tampered with and such evidence could have
    been in the form of depositions or it could have been given by witnesses who
    the court could have permitted to testify orally, and the evidence should
    be preserved in the form of a bill of exceptions. Powell v. Horn, 159 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 532</cite>, 167 S.W. 928, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 862</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).

    the room in which they were kept was again entered by unknown persons, the
    court properly refused to recount the ballots. Powell v. Horn, 159 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 532</cite>, 167 S.W. 928, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 862</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Before a recount will be permitted to overcome the
    prima facie result as shown by the certificate of election, the person seeking
    the recount must show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the ballot boxes
    have been kept as required by statute, that the ballots have not been tampered
    with since the election, and that the ballots offered in evidence are the
    identical ones cast. Craft v. Davidson, 189 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 378</cite>, 224 S.W. 1082, 1920 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 436</cite> (Ky. 1920). See Edwards v.

        Where the proof showed that the ballot boxes were
    placed in a securely locked room, all entrances to which were guarded, and
    that the boxes were properly guarded while being placed in the room, their
    integrity was sufficiently established to justify the opening of the boxes
    and the counting of the ballots in such boxes as bore no evidence of actual
    tampering. Land v. Land, 244 <cite class="ocky"></cite>, 50 S.W.2d 518, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 720</cite> (Ky. 1931) (decided

       <p>
        Evidence that ballot boxes were stored in a room,
    which was kept locked and was guarded at all times by the county clerk or
    his deputy and by representatives of both parties, satisfactorily showed the
    integrity of the ballots, and authorized recount proceedings, though there
    was some very remote possibility that someone might have entered the room,
    and some of the guards did not testify in the recount proceedings. Austin v. Anderson, 279 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 742</cite>, 132 S.W.2d 56, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 345</cite> (Ky. 1939) (decided under prior

        Failure to show that the keys that the three election

       <p>
        When it was shown that the ballots came to the court
    from the officer whose duty it was by law to have and preserve them, and that
    they were apparently in the condition of preservation prescribed by the statute,
    there was a presumption as to their integrity; but if it is shown either that
    they have been tampered with, or that access has been afforded to them to
    unauthorized persons, the burden shifts, and the person seeking the recount
    must then prove affirmatively that the ballots are the identical ones cast,
    and that they have not been mutilated or tampered with. Edwards v. Logan, 114 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 312</cite>, 70 S.W. 852, 75 S.W. 257, 24 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L.

       <p>
        Where party seeking recount merely moved that ballot
    boxes be opened and the ballots recounted, to which the opposing party objected,
    it was proper for court to deny recount in the absence of offer of proof as

        The rule was that the boxes would not be opened for
    a recount unless the person asking for it first showed more than a probability
    that their integrity had been preserved since the election, which fact had
    to be established with a reasonable degree of certainty. Robinson v. Osborne, 314 S.W.2d 681, 1958 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 316</cite> (Ky. 1958) (decided under prior law).

        The certificates of returns were prima facie correct,

    not been properly protected, the certificates had to control. Scholl v. Bell, 125 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 750</cite>, 102 S.W. 248, 31 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 335</cite>, 1907 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 328</cite> (Ky. 1907) (decided under prior law).

        One of several candidates for an office could maintain
    a proceeding for a recount against the candidate who was awarded the certificate
    of election, without joining as parties the other candidates, although some
    of the other candidates, according to the returns, received more votes than
    the one who sought the recount. Kirby v. Creech, 235 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 816</cite>, 32 S.W.2d 419, 1930 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 483</cite> (Ky. 1930) (decided under prior law).

        Where recount showed that neither contestant nor
    contestee had received a plurality of the votes, but a third candidate who
    was not a party to the suit had received the plurality, none of the candidates
    could be declared elected and a vacancy was declared to exist. Kirby v. Creech, 235 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 816</cite>, 32 S.W.2d 419, 1930 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 483</cite> (Ky. 1930) (decided under prior

       <p>
        A candidate could not resort to mandamus to correct
    an error in the count; his sole remedy was by a recount proceeding. Wolff v. Clark, 212 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 435</cite>, 279 S.W. 658, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1128</cite> (Ky. 1925) (decided under prior

       <p>
        Where returns from one precinct had not been counted
    by canvassing board, because board considered that ballots for such precinct
    had not been printed in legal form, the only remedy was by a recount proceeding,
    and the board could not be compelled by mandamus to reconvene and count the
    ballots of such precinct. Hall v. Webber, 229 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 320</cite>, 17 S.W.2d 198, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 741</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        After the canvassing board had canvassed the votes
    and issued a certificate of election, the only method of changing the returns
    was by a proceeding for a recount; mandamus was not available. Hall v. Webber, 229 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 320</cite>, 17 S.W.2d 198, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 741</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decided under prior

        Mandamus would lie to compel canvassing board to

    its action on something which it had done. Wolff v. Clark, 212 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 435</cite>, 279 S.W. 658, 1925 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1128</cite> (Ky. 1925) (decided under prior law).

        Though contestant in election contest did not demand

     Board for determining contest of election of Governor or Lieutenant Governor.
     </h3>
     <p>
      When the election of a Governor and Lieutenant Governor is contested, a board for determining the contest shall be formed and shall proceed in the following manner:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol11">
       On the third day after the organization of the General Assembly that meets next after the election, the Senate shall select three (3) of its members as provided in subsection (2) of this section, and the House of Representatives shall select eight (8) of its members as provided in subsection (2) of this section, and the eleven (11) so selected shall constitute a board to try the contest, seven (7) of whom shall constitute a quorum;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol12">
       In making the selection, the name of each member present shall be written on a separate piece of paper, every piece being as nearly similar to the other as possible. Each piece shall be rolled up so that the names thereon cannot be seen, nor any particular piece ascertained or selected by feeling. The whole, so prepared, shall be placed by the clerk in a box on clerk’s table, and after it has been well shaken, and the papers therein well intermixed, the clerk shall draw out one (1) paper, which shall be opened and read aloud by the presiding officer, and so on until the required number is obtained;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol13">
       If any member selected swears that he or she cannot, without great personal inconvenience, serve on the board, or that he or she feels an undue bias for or against either of the parties, that member may be excused by the house from which that member was chosen from serving on the board. If it appears that a selected member is related to either party, or is liable to any other proper objection on the score of his or her partiality, that member shall be excused. Any deficiency in the proper number created by excuse shall be supplied by another draw from the box;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol14">
       The selected members of the board shall be sworn by the Speaker of the House of Representatives to try the contested election, and shall give true judgment according to the evidence, unless dissolved before rendering judgment;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol15">
       The board shall, within twenty-four (24) hours after its selection, meet, appoint its chair, and assign a day for hearing the contest. It may adjourn from day to day as its business requires. If any member of the board willfully fails to attend its sessions, that member shall be reported to the house to which he or she belongs, and that house shall then, in its discretion, punish that member by fine or imprisonment, or both;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol16">
       The board may, upon a majority of vote, send for persons, papers, and records, including all voting equipment, ballots, boxes, and precinct rosters. The board may issue subpoenas signed by its chair or the Speaker of the House of Representatives;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol17">
       The board may use the services of any law enforcement agency to transport all records relating to the election contest, including voting equipment, ballots, boxes, and precinct rosters. All voting equipment, ballots, boxes, precinct rosters, and other voting records sent for by the board shall be sealed, to the extent possible, and transmitted in a tamper-resistant manner. The chain of custody for the records shall be recorded, in writing, on a form prescribed by the State Board of Elections in administrative regulations promulgated under KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc13A" target="_blank">Chapter 13A</a></cite> to include the identity of the person or persons transferring and receiving the records, and the date, time, and location of the transfer. The clerk of the House of Representatives shall be designated by the board as the custodian of the records while the records are in the possession of the board;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol18">
       If it appears that the slates of candidates receiving the highest number of votes cast have received an equal number, the right to the offices shall be determined by lot, in the manner prescribed by the board, and under the direction of the board;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol19">
       If the person returned for the Office of Governor is found not legally qualified to receive the office at the time of his or her election, a new election shall be ordered to fill the vacancy under subsection (13) of this section;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol110">
       If a slate of candidates other than the one returned is found to have received the highest number of legal votes cast, that slate shall be adjudged by the General Assembly to be the persons elected and entitled to the offices;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol111">
       No decision shall be made but by the vote of at least six (6) members of the board. The decision of the board shall not be final or conclusive, but shall be reported to the two (2) houses of the General Assembly, in joint session, for the further action of the General Assembly. The Speaker of the House shall preside at the joint session, and the General Assembly shall then determine the contest;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol112">
       If no decision of the board is given during the then session of the General Assembly, the board shall be dissolved, unless by joint resolution of the two (2) houses it is empowered to continue longer;
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol113">
       If a new election is required, it shall be immediately ordered by proclamation of the Speaker of the House, who shall issue a writ of election. The writ shall be signed by the Speaker, shall designate the day for holding the election, and shall be directed to the proper sheriff or sheriffs as provided in Section 86 of this Act; and
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.205ol114">
       When a new election is ordered, or the incumbent is adjudged not to be entitled to the office, his or her power shall immediately cease, and if the office is not adjudged to another, it shall be deemed vacant.
      </li>
     </ol>

       <p>
        Kentucky Court of Appeals, in deciding that action
    of General Assembly in contest of election for Governor was final and conclusive,
    and that courts could not question sufficiency of grounds or procedure relied
    on in determining contest, did not deprive unsuccessful candidate of any right
    guaranteed him by the Fourteenth Amendment, or by U. S. Const., Art. IV, § 4. Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U.S. 548, 20 S. Ct. 890, 44 L. Ed. 1187, 1900 U.S. LEXIS 1702 (U.S. 1900) (decided under prior
    law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where General Assembly found that contestant in contest
    for office of Governor was elected, courts could not question the finding
    or adjudge that General Assembly should have declared election void. Taylor v. Beckham, 108 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 278</cite>, 56 S.W. 177, 21 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1735</cite>, 1900 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 39</cite> (Ky.), writ of error dismissed, 178 U.S. 548, 20 S. Ct. 890, 44 L. Ed. 1187, 1900 U.S. LEXIS 1702 (U.S. 1900) (decided
    under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision of General Assembly that contestant in contest
    for office of Governor was entitled to the office was a self-executing judgment,
    and upon its entry in the journals of the General Assembly the contestant
    became Governor, notwithstanding that contestee remained in possession of
    executive building and records in defiance of General Assembly. Powers v. Commonwealth, 110 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 386</cite>, 61 S.W. 735, 22 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1807</cite>, 1901 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 95</cite> (Ky. 1901) (decided under prior

       <p>
        The entries in the journals of the Houses of the
    General Assembly with respect to action in a contest proceeding were conclusive,
    and the courts could not question them or go behind them. Taylor v. Beckham, 108 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 278</cite>, 56 S.W. 177, 21 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L.

    evidence. Taylor v. Beckham, 108 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 278</cite>, 56 S.W. 177, 21 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1735</cite>, 1900 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       Any
    elector who was qualified to and did vote on any public question, other than
    a constitutional amendment or a question of local option under KRS Chapter
    242, submitted to the voters of any county, city or district for their approval
    or rejection may contest the election or demand a recount of the ballots by
    filing a petition, within thirty (30) days after the election, with the clerk
    of the Circuit Court of the county in which the election was held, which court
    shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters in such
    cases. The petition shall be against the county, city or district in which
    the election was held, and shall set forth the grounds of contest or reason
    for requesting a recount. The grounds of contest may be the casting of illegal
    votes, the exclusion of legal votes, the unfair or illegal conduct of the
    election, tampering with the returns, the alteration of the certificates of
    the results, bribery, fraud, intimidation or corrupt practices, or any conduct
    or practice tending to frustrate, obstruct or interfere with the free expression
    of the will of the voters. A copy of the petition shall be posted at the courthouse
    door and at one or more public places in the county, city or district in which
    the election was held. Summons shall be served on the defendant as in equity
    actions.
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.250ol12">
       Upon
    the petition being filed, the circuit clerk shall forthwith order the county
    board of election commissioners and the county clerk of the county involved
    in the contest to preserve and hold the ballots cast at the election on the
    question subject to the order of the Circuit Court. The court shall, within
    five (5) days after the petition is filed, determine whether there are sufficient
    grounds stated to justify the contest, and shall thereupon require the contestants
    to give bond for costs, and fix a time for the defendant to answer, not exceeding
    twenty (20) days.
      </li>
      <li id="tXc120s120.250ol13">
       If
    the county, city or district affected fails to defend the action, any elector
    may become a defendant by filing an answer or other proper pleading within
    thirty (30) days after the filing of the petition, and by giving security
    for the costs in an amount to be fixed by the court. Any elector may join
    and assist the defendant in resisting the action by filing an application
    to do so and by giving security for such proportion of the costs as may be
    adjudged against him.

        In suit to enjoin levy and collection of tax on property

        An election contest action which does not attack

        The final phrase of the description of the type of
    conduct covered by the 30 days provision in this section, “or any conduct
    or practice tending to frustrate, obstruct, or interfere with the free expression
    of the will of the voters,” is intended to amplify the list of election
    violations in the phrases preceding it. It does not function as a divestiture
    of preexisting equitable jurisdiction over void elections. The rule of ejusdem
    generis applies. Such words are general words, not to be construed in their
    widest extent, but to be held as applying only to things of the same general
    kind or class as those specifically mentioned. This chapter, and more specifically,
    subdivision (1) of this section, is a grant of authority, not a limitation
    of preexisting authority. Robinson v. Ehrler, 691 S.W.2d 200, 1985 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 249</cite> (Ky. 1985).

        The 30 days provision in this section relates to
    the type of case where the election is not void ab initio, but voidable (or
    contestable) on grounds specified in this chapter. Robinson v. Ehrler, 691 S.W.2d 200, 1985 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 249</cite> (Ky. 1985).

        The 30 day proviso for election contests under this

        The legislative intent of the Kentucky Corrupt Practices
    Act is to guard against the reality or appearance of corruption in the election
    process, and to equalize the relative ability of all voters to affect the
    outcome of elections. Lee v. Commonwealth, 565 S.W.2d 634, 1978 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 511</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).

        The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the financing
    of campaigns for public office and other activities involving questions to
    be submitted to the state’s voters. Kentucky Educators Public Affairs Council v. Kentucky Registry of Election Finance, 677 F.2d 1125, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 19286 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1982</cite>).

       <p>
        The definition of “contribution” is not
    unconstitutionally overbroad; the law regulates the amount of contributions
    when the slate of candidates elects to receive public financing, thus requiring
    the candidates to obtain funding from a greater number of sources, and the
    overall effect of the limitation on contributions is merely to require candidates
    and political committees to raise funds from a greater number of persons and
    to compel people who would otherwise contribute amounts greater than the statutory
    limits to expend such funds on direct political expression, rather than to
    reduce the total amount of money potentially available to promote political
    expression. Commonwealth v. Martin, 2000 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 135</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2000).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The definition of “knowingly” as applied
    to the defendants was constitutional as they were experienced political operatives
    who knew that their campaign had elected to receive state funding and were
    certainly not novices in the political arena and, therefore, they could determine
    with reasonable certainty whether their actions were illegal. Commonwealth v. Martin, 2000 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 135</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2000).

       Since the election finance act refers to and applies
    only to elections involving public questions, concerning which committees
    for or against have been formed, and certain candidates for public office,
    political action committees advocating or opposing public questions that are
    not subject to referendum would not be governed by the election finance act.

       Under the definition of the term “election,”
    which means any primary, regular or special election, a person could contribute
    up to $3,000 to a particular candidate for use in his primary election campaign
    and a sum equal to this amount for use in his general election campaign. OAG

       Since announcement for a public office is not made
    until after January 1 in the calendar year of the election, while election
    officers for precincts are selected by the previous September 20 in the preceding
    calendar year, members of the county board of elections would be entitled
    to perform their duties, including the selection of election officers on or
    before September 20 as prescribed in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc117s117.045" target="_self">KRS 117.045</a></cite> through the year preceding
    the candidacy for public office, unless, prior to such election, they become
    candidates under any of the conditions set forth in the definition of candidates
    set forth in subsection (7) of this section, and in addition, they would become
    disqualified whenever they actually file as a candidate for public office.

       A candidate can continue to contribute his regular
    personal contributions unrelated to political campaigns to charitable organizations
    of which he is a member or to which he has been a regular contributor for
    more than six months; however, unless and until an officer becomes a candidate
    for reelection within the meaning of the term as defined in subsection (7)
    of this section, the personal contribution restriction under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc121s121.150ol12" target="_self">KRS 121.150(2)</a></cite>

       This section and particularly the phrase “political

    organizations organized on behalf of political parties and the candidates
    of those parties seeking election to public office and thus it has no application

    a public question. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-406</cite>.

        So much of this section as prohibits donations to
    the election campaigns of candidates for the office of property valuation
    administrator by persons whose property he may assess is unconstitutional. Lee v. Commonwealth, 565 S.W.2d 634, 1978 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 511</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).

       <p>
        One of the purposes of former similar statute was
    to prevent coerced contributions from a person who might be under the dominion
    or control of a candidate for office, and it was primarily for the protection
    of the employee. Riddle v. Eaton, 447 S.W.2d 47, 1969 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 63</cite> (Ky. 1969) (decided
    under prior law).

       <p>
        The obvious purpose intended by this section was
    to prohibit bribes, coerced donations from employees and the payment for votes. Lee v. Commonwealth, 565 S.W.2d 634, 1978 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 511</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1978).

        “Official capacity” refers to the public
    office for which the election is being held, and not to an office in a corporation
    with which the contributor is affiliated. Hatcher v. Petry, 261 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 52</cite>, 86 S.W.2d 1043, 1935 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 587</cite> (Ky. 1935) (decided under prior law).

        Where there was not sufficient evidence to authorize
    a finding, as a matter of law, that the alleged activities of the sheriff
    and his deputy were conducted with the knowledge or by the procurement of
    the defendant, the trial court’s finding that the defendant had not violated
    the former Corrupt Practices Act was not erroneous. Riddle v. Eaton, 447 S.W.2d 47, 1969 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 63</cite> (Ky. 1969) (decided under prior law).

       This section would not prevent an employee of the

    practices before the fiscal court, or a citizen of the county whose affairs
    are “supervised, regulated, or controlled in any manner” from
    contributing to the campaign of a candidate for county commissioner, since
    county officers and employes would not be under the candidate’s personal or

        Evidence that candidate, a few days before election,

        The fact that a candidate who was in the garage business

    young man repaired and placed in running condition, did not establish a violation

        Candidate is responsible for vote-buying by others

        Fact that certain vote-buyers were known to be supporters

        Proof that person who asked another to take a substantial

       <p>
        Bribery by the candidate or by others with his knowledge

    the evidence must transcend mere suspicion and there must be reasonable inference
    of guilty knowledge. Lovely v. Cockrell, 237 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 547</cite>, 35 S.W.2d 891, 1931 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 639</cite> (Ky. 1931). See Hogg v.

        Evidence of the actions and conduct of the workers,
    their private meetings with the candidate, their association with him or relationship

    elections, as well as their conduct on the day of election, and also evidence
    of the actions and conduct of the candidate before and on the day of election,
    and his reputation of engaging in corrupt practices, are competent in determining

       <p>
        The sporadic, spontaneous spending of money by friends,
    relatives or partisans of a candidate, without an opportunity for him to obtain
    knowledge, is quite different from the expending of money for him by organized

        Former Corrupt Practices Act did not find a candidate

       </p>
       <p>
        Actual knowledge by the candidate of the illegal

       <p>
        While knowledge of misconduct may often be inferred

    he authorized or ratified their action. Lewis v. Sizemore, 274 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 58</cite>, 118 S.W.2d 133, 1938 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 225</cite> (Ky. 1938) (decided under prior law).

        Evidence that certain candidates for nomination including
    contestee had raised pool of money, without positive or direct evidence that

        Knowledge of misconduct may be inferred from the

        Evidence that candidate saw his campaign manager

    proof that such person had held conferences with candidate’s son. Asher v. Broughton, 231 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 165</cite>, 21 S.W.2d 260, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 247</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decided under prior

       </p>
       <p>
        There must be substantial proof of violation before
    election will be held void; mere surmises, conjectures and speculations based
    on suspicious circumstances are not enough. Asher v. Broughton, 231 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 165</cite>, 21 S.W.2d 260, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 247</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence indicating intention of candidate to violate
    former similar section was insufficient in absence of showing that intent
    was carried out. Murrey v. Kirkman, 231 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 191</cite>, 21 S.W.2d 240, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 237</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decided
    under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contradicted and uncorroborated testimony of two
    discredited witnesses that candidate bought their votes was not sufficient
    to establish candidate’s guilt. Phillips v. Langford, 250 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 578</cite>, 63 S.W.2d 782, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 746</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided under prior law).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence as to acts, conduct and statements of candidate
    before the day of election were admissible to show his intent, motive and
    willingness to violate former similar section, although such evidence did
    not show any actual violations. Howard v. Whittaker, 250 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 836</cite>, 64 S.W.2d 173, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 793</cite> (Ky. 1933) (decided under prior law).

        Conspiracy between candidate for nomination as county
    attorney and operators of gambling devices and slot machines to give them
    immunity in return for their support was not shown by evidence that there
    were number of such places in county to candidate’s knowledge and some of
    their proprietors supported his candidacy. May v. Runyon, 287 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 725</cite>, 155 S.W.2d 195, 1941 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 632</cite> (Ky. 1941) (decided under prior law).

    than five (5) nor more than ten (10) retired or former justices or retired
    or former judges of the Court of Justice who are qualified and willing to
    conduct a hearing to determine if a violation has occurred. Upon receipt of

    one (1) retired or former justice or judge from the list to conduct the hearing,
    which shall be held in accordance with the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure,

    Retired or former justices or judges selected to serve shall receive reimbursement
    from the registry for their reasonable and necessary expenses incurred as
    a result of the performance of their duties at the hourly rate set for attorneys

    prosecution. The Attorney General may request the registry’s attorney or the
    appropriate county or Commonwealth’s attorney to prosecute the matter and
    may request from the registry all evidence collected in its investigation.
    In the event the Attorney General or the appropriate local prosecutor fails
    to prosecute in a timely fashion, the registry may petition the Circuit Court
    to appoint the registry’s attorney to prosecute, and upon a motion timely
    filed, for good cause shown, the court shall enter an order to that effect.
    Prosecutions involving campaign finance law violations, in which the reports
    are required to be filed in Frankfort, may be conducted in Franklin Circuit
    Court or in the Circuit Court for the county in which the contribution or
    expenditure constituting a campaign finance violation was solicited, made,

       <p>
        The Campaign Finance Law’s distinction between permanent
    committees and political candidates does not render it unconstitutional. The
    disparate treatment reflects an analogous legislative determination that aggregate
    limitations are necessary to prevent manipulation of permanent committees
    in order to evade the Law’s $1,000 limitation of direct contributions to any
    one political candidate. Kentucky Right to Life v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 1997 FED App. 0088P, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 4004 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 860, 118 S. Ct. 162, 139 L. Ed. 2d 106, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5334 (U.S. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The $1,000 limitation of subsection (6) of this section
    and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.10.html#tXc121As121A.050ol11" target="_blank">KRS 121A.050(1)</a></cite> on direct contributions in connections with state and
    local elections is not different in kind from the $1,000 limitation on direct
    contributions in connection with federal elections, and plaintiffs’ First
    Amendment challenge to the limitation was rejected. Kentucky Right to Life v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 1997 FED App. 0088P, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 4004 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 860, 118 S. Ct. 162, 139 L. Ed. 2d 106, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5334 (U.S. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The $1,500 limit of subsection (10) of this section
    furthers the goal of preventing corruption in Kentucky politics by avoiding
    evasion of the individual contribution limitations. This goal of combating
    corruption, combined with the limited protection afforded this type of speech,
    compels the conclusion that subsection (10) is constitutional. Kentucky Right to Life v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 1997 FED App. 0088P, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 4004 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 860, 118 S. Ct. 162, 139 L. Ed. 2d 106, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5334 (U.S. 1997).

       <p>
        The definition of “independent expenditure”
    does not impinge on constitutionally protected activity as it does not prohibit
    individuals or organizations from communicating with a campaign, but rather
    attempts to prevent circumvention of the restriction on contributions after
    a slate elects to accept state funds for running its campaign. Commonwealth v. Martin, 2000 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 135</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2000).

       <p>
        Commonwealth of Kentucky’s
    $50,000 limitation on loans by candidates to their campaign committees serves
    compelling state interests. As well, the provision is narrowly tailored and
    acts in tandem with other provisions of the statutory scheme in guarding against
    corruption and the appearance thereof. Anderson v. Spear, 189 F. Supp. 2d 644, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5215 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2002</cite>).

       <p>
        The $50,000 loan limit of former subsection (15) (now see (13)) and former subsection (20) (now see (19)) of this section removes the appearance that heavily indebted candidates are easy bedfellows for quid pro quo contributors.
    Because they may not make loans in excess of $50,000 to their own campaigns,
    they cease to be personally financially vulnerable and therefore do not appear
    to be easy targets for corrupt contributors. Wilkinson v. Jones, 876 F. Supp. 916, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1777 (W.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1995</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The $50,000 limit on amount that candidate can loan

       <p>
        The $1,500 aggregate limit of subsection (10) of
    this section furthers the Campaign Finance Law’s statutory scheme by preventing
    evasion of the $1,000 limit upon direct individual contributions to candidates.
    Absent this aggregate limit, unscrupulous individuals could pass unlimited
    amounts of cash to permanent committees with the understanding that those
    funds would be disbursed directly to specific candidates. Kentucky Right to Life v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 1997 FED App. 0088P, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 4004 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 860, 118 S. Ct. 162, 139 L. Ed. 2d 106, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5334 (U.S. 1997).

       <p>
        The contribution limits of election financing laws
    target the size of contributions, presumably based upon the theory that the
    smaller the contribution the less coercive it will be. The provision governing
    the timing of contributions diminishes the appearance that contributions that
    are made by supporters after the election foster a quid pro quo relationship.
    While post-election contributions may in actuality reimburse a candidate for
    loans made to the campaign, there is an impression that the contributor is
    lining the candidate’s pocket, as there is no ongoing campaign to which the
    contribution may be made. Wilkinson v. Jones, 876 F. Supp. 916, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1777 (W.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1995</cite>).

       Under the definitions of “cash” and “cashier’s
    checks” given in Lane v. Railey (1939), 280 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 319</cite>, 133 S.W.2d 74, 1939 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 120</cite>, and other authorities,
    a cashier’s check should be considered a cash political contribution, pursuant
    to subsection (4) of this section, where there cannot be established a substantial
    nexus between the individual contributor and the check. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-159</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The $3,000 limitation in this section applies only
    to those persons making contributions to the candidate, his treasurer or committee
    on his behalf and not to the candidate himself. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-590</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the term “person” as used in this
    section refers to a human being and does not include an unincorporated association,
    the $3,000 limitation would not apply to one contribution from an association
    or a group of people, although the limitation would apply to each individual
    of the group. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-325</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A candidate can continue to contribute his regular
    personal contributions unrelated to political campaigns to charitable organizations
    of which he is a member or to which he has been a regular contributor for
    more than six (6) months; however, unless and until an officer becomes a candidate
    for reelection within the meaning of the term as defined in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXc121s121.015ol17" target="_self">KRS 121.015(7)</a></cite>,
    the personal contribution restriction under subsection (2) of this section
    would have no application. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-255</cite>.

       Expenditures of campaign funds can be made solely
    for campaign purposes under the terms of the Corrupt Practices Act. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-255</cite>.

      <p>
       Subsection (2) of this section clearly prohibits campaign
    contributions by or on behalf of a candidate to charitable organizations,
    irrespective of whether they are so-called left-over campaign funds. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-255</cite>.

       The use of corporate facilities or other “things
    of value” by a sponsored Political Action Committee (PAC) should be

       Legislative candidates for the November 1996 general
    electionhave until 20 days following that election to bring permanent committee
    contribution percentages into compliance with the newly established limits
    of 50 percent or $10,000, whichever is greater. Because of the deletion of
    references to “election cycle” from subsection (25) of this section,
    that concept, and contributions during such period as previously defined,
    have no application to the November 1996 general election or contributions
    made in such regard. Accounting for permanent committee campaign contributions
    in relation to the November 1996 general election, will be based upon committee
    contributions subsequent to the May 1996 primary, since, with the elimination
    of the “election cycle” concept, contribution accounting will
    be from election to election. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 96-25</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the elimination of statutory limitations on contributions
    by political party executive committees to certain candidates during an “election
    cycle,” no statutory limitations were present to restrict political
    party executive committee contributions to candidates in special elections
    conducted in June 1996. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 96-26</cite>.

       Subsections (1)(b), (2)(d), and (2)(f) of 32 KAR 2:190, Section 1, partially exceed their statutory mandate of determining affiliation “by bylaw structure or by registration,” and are unenforceable to that extent.

Determination of permanent committees’
    affiliation “by bylaw structure” must be made in context of overall control relationship of the entities when committee bylaws do not establish an affiliation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 2004-14</cite>.

        The penalty provisions of former law providing penalties
    for violation of election law could not reasonably apply to a mere delay in
    appointing a campaign treasurer in the manner and in the time provided by

       <p>
        The requirement that campaign advertising and literature
    state the name and address of the sponsors promotes a fair and honest campaign
    and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution obviates the need
    for anonymity. Morefield v. Moore, 540 S.W.2d 873, 1976 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 39</cite> (Ky. 1976).

        Subsection (1) of this section is not unduly restrictive
    and overbroad in its inclusion of posters, circulars, and handbills in a listing

       </p>
       <p>
        The identification provisions of subsection (1) of
    this section that campaign communications contain the language “paid
    for by” is narrowly tailored to meet the compelling state requirements
    of providing the electorate with sufficient information as to where campaign
    money is from and how it is spent, deterring actual corruption and the appearance
    of corruption by exposing large contributions and expenditures to the light
    of publicity and recordkeeping, reporting and disclosure to gather data necessary
    to detect violations of the contribution limitations inasmuch as they only
    require the identification of the payor. Wilkinson v. Jones, 876 F. Supp. 916, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1777 (W.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1995</cite>).

       <p>
        Though it would not be unreasonable to consider bumper
    stickers as a type of “poster,” their use has been so widespread
    and of such long standing that the General Assembly intended them to be excluded
    from the requirement of this section. Thomas v. Collinsworth, 606 S.W.2d 159, 1980 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 253</cite> (Ky. 1980).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The identification disclaimer for independent expenditures
    contained in subsection (1) of this section is narrowly tailored toward achieving
    the goals of preventing actual and perceived corruption by immediately notifying
    the public of any possible allegiance a particular candidate may feel toward
    the publisher, and provides the registry with a method of detecting those
    expenditures which are not truly independent by providing a paper trial to
    detect violations by unscrupulous PACs routing expenditures through individuals.
    Therefore, plaintiffs First Amendment challenge to subsection (1) was rejected. Kentucky Right to Life v. Terry, 108 F.3d 637, 1997 FED App. 0088P, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 4004 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 860, 118 S. Ct. 162, 139 L. Ed. 2d 106, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5334 (U.S. 1997).
