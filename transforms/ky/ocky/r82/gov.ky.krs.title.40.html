        District court properly granted summary judgment for police officers in an estate administrator’s 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 action alleging a violation of the decedent’s U.S. Const. amend. XIV due process rights from the officers’
    failure to arrest the decedent’s abusive boyfriend the night before she was murdered; there was no constitutional violation because <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403s403.785ol12" target="_blank">KRS 403.785(2)</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.005ol14" target="_self">KRS 431.005(4)</a></cite> did not confer an entitlement or property interest on victims of domestic abuse.

        Since neither the Kentucky legislature nor judiciary has affirmatively indicated that <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403s403.785ol12" target="_blank">KRS 403.785(2)</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.005ol14" target="_self">KRS 431.005(4)</a></cite> confer an entitlement or property interest on victims of domestic abuse, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is left to conclude that Kentucky neither intended to grant, nor did grant, such an entitlement for purposes of creating a protected property interest under the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Howard v. Bayes, 457 F.3d 568, 2006 FED App. 0285P, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 20378 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2006</cite>).

        Although Kentucky affords greater protections for its citizens when officers investigate past crimes, its prerogative to experiment with greater constitutional protections does not require Fourth Amendment to do same.

        Railroad police agents had power to make a citizen arrest where felony was committed in their presence or where there was probable cause to believe the person arrested committed it. United States v. Hensley, 374 F.2d 341, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 7323 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 388 U.S. 923, 87 S. Ct. 2139, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1373, 1967 U.S. LEXIS 1245 (U.S. 1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The arresting officer’s testimony established that he made the arrest on the reasonable belief that the person arrested had committed a felony rather than on the basis of warrant issued pursuant to a deficient affidavit. Scamahorne v. Commonwealth, 376 S.W.2d 686, 1964 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 466</cite> (Ky. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Citizen’s arrest was valid where evidence clearly established that a felony had occurred, that an automobile was seen on the premises the day the felony was discovered, that the defendant was present in the same car the following day near the scene of the crime, and that one of the occupants of the automobile admitted the offense and implicated the defendant. Whitaker v. Commonwealth, 479 S.W.2d 592, 1972 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 298</cite> (Ky. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where officers armed with an arrest warrant who entered defendant’s unlocked home and waited for his return were proceeding in reliance on reliable information and had reasonable grounds to believe defendant had committed a felony which gave authority to arrest, with or without a warrant, claimed invalidity of the warrant was not fatal. Caine v. Commonwealth, 491 S.W.2d 824, 1973 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 605</cite> (Ky.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 876, 94 S. Ct. 80, 38 L. Ed. 2d 121, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 885 (U.S. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        An officer did not have reasonable grounds to believe the person being arrested had committed a felony when the only information he had was that a reliable, confidential informant told him that if he wanted to catch a purse-snatcher he should talk to the defendant. Jones v. Commonwealth, 556 S.W.2d 918, 1977 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 824</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).

       <p>
        Denial of defendant’s motion to suppress evidence of drugs found in his truck during a safety inspection was proper because, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.24.html#tXXIVc281s281.765" target="_blank">KRS 281.765</a></cite>, when confronted with irregularities in defendant’s bills of lading and logbooks, the vehicle enforcement officers were permitted to investigate why defendant’s records were not in compliance with the laws, and, because the delay was not unreasonable, the officers were permitted to call in a drug sniffing dog, who alerted to drugs, giving probable cause for the search. Meghoo v. Commonwealth, 245 S.W.3d 752, 2008 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 31</cite> (Ky. 2008).

        This section authorizes an officer to arrest for a misdemeanor committed in his presence and does not allow an arrest on the suspicion of the commission of a misdemeanor. Johnson v.

        Since, in this State, a private person cannot make an arrest for a misdemeanor, it is no defense to an action for false imprisonment that a merchant had probable cause to believe that an individual was committing a misdemeanor.

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress evidence seized from defendant’s person after defendant was placed under arrest and searched because the police officer had a reasonable belief to conclude that a criminal trespass was being committed in the police officer’s presence when defendant was on property that was owned by the Lexington Housing Authority. The defendant acted evasively, defendant could not identify who he intended to visit on the property, and the property was clearly posted to prohibit trespassing, loitering, and congregating.

        Where defendant in attempting to board a plane aroused suspicion by having a gun, a knife, and bullets on his person which were discovered by magnometer and removed, a search of his person before he boarded was held to be a reasonable search.

        Officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for carrying a concealed weapon because a gun was placed underneath a toolbox in such a way that it could not be seen, and it was reasonable to assume that the weapon was not observable to those with whom defendant would have come into ordinary contact. The search and ultimate seizure of the gun and controlled substances found on defendant’s person constituted a valid search incident to arrest. Vega v.

        In case involving an off-duty corrections officer who was working security for a hospital, the trial court did not err in its determination that the officer was entitled to defend against plaintiff's claims of negligence, assault, battery, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress—all of which plaintiff alleged stemmed from the officer's decision to forcibly stop plaintiff and search her purse for a weapon she threatened to have—on the basis of qualified immunity. That the officer was being privately employed on the inside of the hospital did not diminish his ability to keep the peace.

        Officer had probable cause for the warrantless arrest of defendant because the observation of defendant’s glassy eyes and odd behavior coupled with her admission that she was taking prescription medication that included a warning about driving was sufficient to provide the officer with probable cause to arrest defendant for driving under the influence. Therefore, the warrantless arrest of defendant did not deprive her of her constitutional rights against illegal search and seizure. Leatherman v.

        The prior knowledge required by the arresting officer is not such as guarantees a conviction; it is such that makes it probable, by the use of any one or more of the five (5) senses, that in the opinion of the arresting officer the accused had committed or was in the act of committing a felony.

        Since a policeman may “observe” with any of his five (5) senses for purposes of a misdemeanor arrest, when the arresting officer approached the car and smelled marijuana smoke, he had probable cause to believe that a misdemeanor was being committed in his presence by the defendant, and the arrest without a warrant was proper.

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion pursuant to RCr 9.78 to suppress drugs found on defendant; an informant’s tip provided probable cause for an arrest and search, as the tip had sufficient indicia of reliability, and police corroborated the details, so defendant’s rights pursuant to Ky. Const., § 10 were not violated, and even though an initial search of defendant’s vehicle did not reveal any contraband, the officer had sufficient probable cause under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.005ol11c" target="_self">KRS 431.005(1)(c)</a></cite> to make a warrantless arrest.

        Although an officer saw drug paraphernalia after opening the door to the motel room in which defendant was staying, since the officer had no justifiable reason to enter the room without first obtaining a warrant, the drugs and paraphernalia, which were the fruits of the illegal entry, should have been suppressed.

        Based on a citizen’s complaint regarding plaintiff’s erratic and dangerous driving, and his own observations of defendant during a high-speed pursuit, the police officer determined that defendant was speeding and fleeing a police officer. The officer had probable cause to arrest plaintiff for driving under the influence. Dier v. City of Prestonsburg, 480 F. Supp. 2d 929, 2007 U.S. Dist.

        Where the officers gained reliable information that defendant and his brother were involved in a shooting, they found defendant’s brother and a witness-described vehicle within three blocks of the murder scene, and apprehended the brother after he ran from the police, those events strengthened the witnesses’
    reports that defendant was also involved in the shooting and gave the officers reasonable grounds to believe that defendant was guilty of committing a felony. Therefore, the police had probable cause justifying the warrantless arrest of defendant and his confession was not inadmissible on that basis. Taylor v.

       This section does not authorize a deputy sheriff, who is not filling an authorized deputy position under a fiscal court order, to make an arrest as a peace officer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-881</cite>.

       A police officer in a city of the fourth class may arrest a subject any place within the county on the basis of a warrant issued anywhere in Kentucky providing the warrant is outstanding and “on file” within the county but he may not arrest a defendant on the basis of a warrant “on file” in another county. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-575</cite>.

       Although a police officer who observes a known drug dealer seated in one (1) parked car pass a small package to a known drug user seated in a second parked car lacks information necessary for probable cause to arrest the individuals, it would not be unreasonable for him to approach the individuals and briefly detain them for the limited purpose of investigating the reasons for the rendezvous. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-710</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a police officer on routine patrol observed an individual seated in one (1) parked car pass a small package to another individual seated in a second parked car, the fact that the police officer knew that one (1) party was a known drug dealer and that the other was a known drug user furnished no probable cause for arrest of the individuals and a search of them or their cars, since the police officer had no prior information that a sale of illegal drugs was to be made at that particular time and the officer observed no contraband in plain sight. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-710</cite>.

       As far as this section is concerned there are only two (2) types of public offenses, felonies and misdemeanors, and even though the penal code designates certain offenses as “violations” the law of arrest applies to the so-called violations the same as misdemeanors. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-143</cite> (withdrawing <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-395</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       A police officer of a fifth class city, who has the statutory authority to make an arrest anywhere in the county in which the city is located, has not only the authority but the duty to make an arrest for a misdemeanor committed in his presence, in the county, regardless of whether he is on-duty or off-duty. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-146</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legality of the Acts 1980, ch. 312, § 1, which amended this section to allow warrantless arrest on probable cause in specified instances of domestic violence, was not affected by the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 100 S. Ct. 1371, 63 L. Ed. 2d 639, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1980), which held that police officers may not enter a private residence without a warrant absent exigent circumstances to make a felony arrest, since many of the elements in chapter 312, § 1 permitting warrantless arrest also relate to exigent circumstances. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-280</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A peace officer may make an arrest without a warrant for an infraction of any of the six (6) statutes named in subsection (1)(e) of this section committed in his presence, with no other condition, however, a physical arrest is not mandatory; a peace officer may make an arrest without a warrant for an infraction of any other “violation,” as classified under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.060" target="_self">KRS 431.060</a></cite>, committed in his presence, if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant, if a citation is issued, will not appear in court at the designated time to answer the charge. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-445</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A police department may not, under subsection (2), require execution of a written statement by an abused person indicating his or her willingness to prosecute the person to be arrested as a condition precedent to arrest, since imposing such a prerequisite to arrest would appear to circumvent the purpose of the section which is to permit a peace officer to remove a person exercising a dangerously dominant influence over a relative. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-81</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Civil liability against an arresting peace officer should not be imposed for false imprisonment if the officer has reasonable grounds to make such an arrest and acts in good faith, even if the arrestee is subsequently not guilty of any offense. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-81</cite>.

       The only legal deputy sheriffs are those appointed by the sheriff to fill deputy positions authorized by the urban county council pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.530" target="_blank">KRS 64.530</a></cite>, 67A.060, 67A.300, and unsalaried deputy sheriffs, called “courtesy special deputies,” are illegal; such illegal deputies are merely private persons and would have the power of arrest given to private persons under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.005ol12" target="_self">KRS 431.005(2)</a></cite>, but they are not peace officers and they cannot carry concealed deadly weapons for any reason. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-105</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Special policemen have the same powers as regular policemen unless their powers are expressly limited by statute or ordinance, and special or auxiliary police officers have the same power of arrest under this section as is conferred upon regular policemen; in addition, a regular police officer’s power of arrest is not affected or limited by the number of hours he works and he has the same powers of arrest as any other regular member of the police force even if he works less than 40 hours a week. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-183</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a peace officer spots a vehicle a short distance from the scene of an accident which he suspects as having been involved in the accident, he is justified in making an arrest for leaving the scene, for the reason that the driver is guilty of a continuing violation of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.16.html#tXVIc189s189.580" target="_blank">KRS 189.580</a></cite> and is still involved in leaving the scene at the time of the arrest, so that this misdemeanor is in fact being committed in the officer’s presence at the time of the arrest. It is not required that the officer witness the vehicle leave the accident scene itself in order for the officer to make an arrest. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-301</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A peace officer may not make an arrest for a misdemeanor or violation if the misdemeanor or violation is not committed in his presence and he may not issue a citation instead of making an arrest if the misdemeanor or violation is not committed in his presence. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-393</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a misdemeanor or violation committed in connection with a zoning ordinance is not committed in the presence of a peace officer, the officer would have to follow the procedures set forth in RCr 2.02 and 2.04 to obtain a warrant of arrest or summons for the violation or misdemeanor. A private person could follow such procedures to get a warrant of arrest or summons issued. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-393</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A validly appointed deputy jailer can effect an arrest in the county if he follows the dictates of this section; thus a deputy jailer can make an arrest in his county for a misdemeanor in obedience to a warrant or without a warrant when a misdemeanor, as defined in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.060" target="_self">KRS 431.060</a></cite>, has been committed in his presence; however, an arrest under the special circumstances related in subsection (2) of this section does not apply to a deputy jailer. A regular deputy jailer is required to be on duty in connection with the jail operations under a full and regular schedule but even if a deputy jailer is remiss in his jail duties, such would not invalidate his arrest actions if properly effected. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-422</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court, in an ordinance creating an auxiliary county police force, has the authority to extend to such auxiliary county policemen the full powers of arrest of a statutory peace officer, including the right to carry a weapon; under these county legislative conditions, and once the auxiliary county policemen have been duly appointed and have taken the oath, they become policemen and peace officers as long as they remain on the force. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-58</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A police officer may make an actual arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor committed in his presence, i.e., a violation by a nonresident of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.16.html#tXVIc186s186.620ol12" target="_blank">KRS 186.620(2)</a></cite> prohibiting driving without a license, if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the person will not appear to answer the charge. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-67</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a police officer has evidence or knowledge that a nonresident driver found to be in violation of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.16.html#tXVIc186s186.620" target="_blank">KRS 186.620</a></cite> has previously ignored a citation or summons issued by a law enforcement officer of this state or some other jurisdiction, that would probably constitute reasonable grounds to believe that the person would not appear to answer the charges in connection with the most recent incident, thus justifying the person’s arrest. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-67</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A regular county policeman is a “peace officer,” under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXLIc446s446.010ol124" target="_blank">KRS 446.010(24)</a></cite> (now (25)) and this section, at all times. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-90</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The arresting powers described in subsection (1) of this section apply to special deputy sheriffs appointed pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc70s70.045" target="_blank">KRS 70.045</a></cite> when that deputy is properly on duty in connection with an actual emergency. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-246</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A special deputy appointed under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc70s70.045" target="_blank">KRS 70.045</a></cite> is not a “peace officer” as defined in subsection (3) of this section for purposes of subsection (2) of this section regarding warrantless arrests, since the special deputy is not a full-time paid deputy sheriff. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-246</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.060" target="_self">KRS 431.060</a></cite>, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc500s500.020" target="_blank">500.020 </a></cite>and this section must be read together, and such a reading reveals that a law-enforcement officer may only arrest without a warrant an individual who in the officer’s presence commits a misdemeanor, an offense punishable by confinement other than in the penitentiary whether or not a fine or other penalty may also be assessed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-258</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The language used by the legislature in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403s403.760" target="_blank">KRS 403.760</a></cite>, which states that violation of the terms or conditions of an order issued under the provisions of this act “shall constitute contempt of court,” does not empower a law-enforcement officer to arrest without a warrant a spouse found violating the provisions of an order restraining said spouse from visiting the residence of the petitioning spouse; however, the language in no way limits a law-enforcement officer’s power to arrest without a warrant a visiting spouse if, for example, an assault, trespassing, abuse, or other offense has been committed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-258</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An officer who obtains a signed statement at the time of apprehension and before the actual booking process can still comply with the language of subsection (2) of this section, so long as the arrest is not made contingent upon the execution of the statement. In view of the express language of the statute, it is recommended that peace officers exercise caution in soliciting such statements at the time of arrest. Furthermore, under no circumstances should the arresting officer, after initially determining that there is probable cause for the arrest, then release the abusing relative or fail to follow through with the booking process simply because the abused person has expressed an unwillingness to provide a statement. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 90-128</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) of this section requires that the warrantless arrest in no way be made contingent upon the execution of a signed statement by the abused individual at the time the arrest occurs; however, the language of the statute does not prohibit an officer from obtaining the signed statement at the time of the arrest, if the abused person indicates a willingness to provide it. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 90-128</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the accused has apparently desisted from the threat of danger to the victim and victim’s present location is apparently safe from attack, the decision to seek promptly an arrest warrant and a domestic violence protective order pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403s403.715" target="_blank">KRS 403.715</a></cite> to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403s403.785" target="_blank">403.785 </a></cite>rather than undertake a warrantless arrest would be justified and appropriate. Conversely, if the accused has fled from the scene of the attack and the officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the accused intentionally or wantonly caused physical injury to the victim and still presents an immediate threat of danger, for example, because the accused may return to the victim’s dwelling or other location or because the accused may follow, menace, stalk, or otherwise stay in the vicinity of the victim; a warrantless arrest under subsection (2) of this section would be justified. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-96</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether a warrantless arrest is made, the officer should attempt to determine and document from the victim, any other witnesses, and any available physical evidence whether a reasonable probability still exists that the accused presents an immediate threat of danger to the victim. If the accused is available and willing to discuss the situation, the officer should attempt to obtain a written or recorded statement from the accused. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-96</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) of this section requires that the officer have probable cause to believe that the accused has caused physical injury to his family member (e.g., spouse or former spouse), or other person of an unmarried couple and that the accused presents a danger or threat of danger to others if not immediately restrained. The fact that the victim (or complaining witness) has fled to the dwelling of a third party or to a public building does not necessarily mean that the accused no longer presents an immediate threat of danger. Assuming that the accused has not followed the victim into the new location or building, the accused may still intend to retaliate against the victim as soon as the opportunity presents itself. In such a situation, the accused would still present a threat of danger if not immediately restrained by warrantless arrest. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-96</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the victim has fled from the scene (e.g., the dwelling where the parties reside) of the assault does not prevent the officer from making a warrantless arrest. Whether accused should be immediately arrested for the appropriate degree of assault regardless of his location depends upon whether there is probable cause that the accused still presents an immediate threat of danger to the victim. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-96</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A special deputy sheriff, whether a “general law enforcement deputy” (KRS 70.045(1)), or an “emergency situation deputy” (KRS 70.045(2)), as an unpaid deputy, cannot make a warrantless arrest pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-115</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An unpaid special deputy sheriff appointed pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc70s70.045" target="_blank">KRS 70.045</a></cite> can, except in the case of a domestic violence related arrest that would be made pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, make an arrest either with or without a warrant, when authorized under other provisions of this section, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc70s70.045" target="_blank">KRS 70.045</a></cite>, and other provisions of the law. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-140</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An unpaid special deputy sheriff (KRS 70.045) is not a “peace officer” for purposes of making a warrantless arrest pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-140</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The courts of this state have for many years regarded a deputy sheriff as having substantially the same authority as the sheriff. Breaking and entering a house or enclosure to carry out an order of arrest would be a duty of the sheriff, and thus could be carried out by a deputy of the sheriff, or a special deputy of the sheriff. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-140</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The limited definition of “peace officer” set forth in subsection (3) of this section as affecting a special deputy sheriff (KRS 70.045), applies only in relation to an arrest that would be made without a warrant pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.005ol12" target="_self">KRS 431.005(2)</a></cite>, in what might be termed the “domestic violence” circumstance. This limited definition does not restrict the authority of a special deputy sheriff, as a peace officer, to make an arrest without a warrant as required by <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403s403.760ol12" target="_blank">KRS 403.760(2)</a></cite>, for violation of a protective order issued under the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403s403.740" target="_blank">KRS 403.740</a></cite> or <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.35.html#tXXXVc403s403.750" target="_blank">403.750.</a></cite> <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-140</cite>.

      <p>
       A railroad policeman may make an arrest off railroad property, but within a county through which the railroad operates, for a felony, without an arrest warrant, if (1) the offense is a felony, and (2) the arrest is for an offense “committed upon or about railroad property,” and (3) the circumstances specified in subdivision (1)(b) or (1)(c) of this section are present. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 93-29</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Volunteer” deputy sheriffs are, from a legal perspective, “special deputy sheriffs” (KRS 70.045). A “volunteer” (special) deputy sheriff, appointed for “general law enforcement” pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc70s70.045" target="_blank">KRS 70.045</a></cite>(1) has the same powers, except in the case of a warrantless arrest pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, as a “regular” or paid deputy sheriff. A special deputy appointed for “emergency circumstances” under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc70s70.045" target="_blank">KRS 70.045</a></cite>(2) has the powers of a special deputy sheriff only during preparation for, or the occurrences of, emergencies such as fire, flood, storm, or other “such emergencies.” The sheriff must cause signification of the statutory provision under which a special deputy is appointed to appear on the county clerk order book together with the deputy’s name. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 95-22</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A federal agent who makes a “citizen’s arrest” may lawfully make such an arrest only where there is strict conformity with this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 95-30</cite>.

        In a pre-trial hearing on a motion to suppress, the trial court could rely on statements in the uniform citation issued to defendant, even though the citation was not offered or admitted into evidence; the citation was used by both parties during the hearing, the trial court reviewed the citation, and defendant referenced it, confirmed its creation and authenticity, and asked questions from it for purposes of impeachment. Commonwealth v. Priddy, 184 S.W.3d 501, 2005 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 389</cite> (Ky. 2005), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 980, 127 S. Ct. 444, 166 L.

Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc433s433.236" target="_self">433.236 </a></cite>as controlling in cases of shoplifting.

      <p>
       The only remedy for failure to appear is a complaint and warrant on the original offense. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-40</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A conservation officer may issue a citation as authorized by this section instead of making an arrest for a misdemeanor committed in the officer’s presence. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-516</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A citation issued under this section does not confer jurisdiction of the person unless he presents himself before the court in response to it or enters appearance by an attorney, and there is no formal charge as a matter of record in the court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 65-606</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city police officer may issue citations instead of making arrests for misdemeanors committed on privately owned parking lots if committed in his presence. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 67-270</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a misdemeanor is committed in his presence, a state trooper may cite the alleged offender to appear before any magistrate in the county. Where a trooper follows a pattern of taking all citations to one particular magistrate with regularity, this is an administrative matter under the control of the department of public safety (now Justice Cabinet). <cite class="OAG"> OAG 69-206</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable can issue citations in traffic violation cases outside of his district citing such cases either to the county or justice’s court or to the police judge. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 70-792</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A police officer may not issue a citation for a misdemeanor which he did not witness even though his observation of physical evidence at a traffic accident would allow him to form a judgment as to who has violated a traffic regulation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 72-619</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of a justice of the peace in a criminal matter does not attach upon the issuance of a citation which does not have the legal efficacy of a warrant or summons and there is no jurisdiction unless the accused obeys the citation or enters his appearance by other means and, where a citation is issued and the accused does not enter his appearance, a complaint may be filed pursuant to RCr 2.02 and a warrant or summons issued pursuant to RCr 2.04 and the defendant is either arrested or comes into the court, at which time jurisdiction of the person attaches and a formal charge is presented for adjudication. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 73-312</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant who is given a citation can appear in court by a written statement delivered to the court and can enter a plea of guilty by waiving his personal appearance at the trial, which may be held in his absence. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-247</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sheriff or other peace officer is entitled to the same fee for issuing a citation for a misdemeanor as they are for making an arrest for the same misdemeanor. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-361</cite> (overruling 60-787, 66-756, 68-511, 74-27 and any other opinions to the extent they are in conflict).
      </p>
      <p>
       Parking tickets are not citations so they may be issued by city “meter maids” who are minors and if the owner or operator does not respond then a warrant or summons may be issued by the police court judge on the complaint of the “meter maids” pursuant to RCr 2.02 and 2.04 but the “meter maids” cannot make arrests under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.005" target="_self">KRS 431.005</a></cite> for parking violations which are misdemeanors since the “meter maids” are not peace officers under this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-552</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of the Penal Code, traffic offenses will be traffic infractions and not crimes; and, for purposes of existing law outside the Code, they will be designated as either felonies or misdemeanors pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.060" target="_self">KRS 431.060</a></cite> for which peace officers may make arrests or issue citations pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.005" target="_self">KRS 431.005</a></cite> and this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-675</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An officer who cannot read or write may have another person write a citation for a misdemeanor done in the officer’s presence. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-841</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A peace officer has no authority, by virtue of this section, to irrevocably determine the specific magistrate to whom a defendant will be required to plead. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-875</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A citation issued pursuant to this section is not a court process. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-116</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inasmuch as a citation does not and cannot compel a person to appear before a court, a peace officer who believes the person cited for a misdemeanor will appear can obtain a warrant by making a complaint before a magistrate. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-246</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A peace officer would not be prohibited from using a privately owned vehicle in his official work of patrolling and issuing citations. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-561</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this section has not established guidelines by which the peace officer must determine whether to issue a citation or take the defendant into custody, the peace officer should exercise his sound judgment in each case as to whether the misdemeanant will probably respond to the citation or whether a physical arrest and taking into custody is necessary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-224</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff can collect the arrest fee only where he, or a deputy, arrests the defendant and takes him to the appropriate judge for bail and further processing but, where the arrest is only for a short period and is followed by issuing a citation, the arrest fee cannot be earned. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-224</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was designed to eliminate arrests in mere traffic violations and other minor misdemeanors. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-224</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In requiring that the citation shall provide that defendant shall appear within a designated time, this section mandates that the peace officer issuing the citation must fill in appropriate blanks on the citation indicating precisely the date he must appear in District Court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-249</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislative purpose is to give defendants a chance, in minor infractions of the law, to voluntarily walk into court without having to be summoned or arrested under a warrant. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-249</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the defendant makes his appearance in District Court on the date mentioned in the citation, and even if the court does not hear the case on that date, the court would be violating the legislative policy to issue a summons or a warrant for his appearance on the date the court finally sets for the case; if the defendant appears voluntarily under the citation on the date designated in the citation, the court should presume that defendant will appear on a subsequent date set for trial and then if defendant does not show, a summons or warrant may be issued. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-249</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the peace officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person charged with the traffic violation will not appear to answer the charge, he can arrest the defendant in good conscience, but the officer has no right to assume the defendant will not make an appearance merely because he is a nonresident. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-318</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While a peace officer may issue a citation for a misdemeanor or violation committed in his presence, a nonpeace officer may not do so. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-34</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only two (2) types of offenses as far as the law of arrest is concerned, felonies and misdemeanors, and a peace officer may make an arrest at his discretion for a misdemeanor or violation committed in his presence. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-143</cite> (withdrawing <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-395</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the county jailer and his deputies are peace officers within the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXLIc446s446.010" target="_blank">KRS 446.010</a></cite>, they may issue traffic citations pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of this section for misdemeanors or violations committed in their presence. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-231</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The citation procedure employed by conservation officers for the department of fish and wildlife, whereby when one (1) officer observes a fishing violation he radios the description of the violator to a second officer in the parking area, who observes the individual to determine the make, model and license number of the individual’s vehicle, and then relays all of this information to a third officer who is parked down the road and stops the individual and issues a citation charging him with whatever violation has been observed by the first officer, is a lawful procedure since it can be said that the other conservation officers were acting as agents or were assisting the officer who had personally observed the violations. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-324</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The practice of employing an officer in an airplane to observe speeding violations which are then communicated to other officers who cite the violator is proper under the language of subsection (1) of this section since it can be said that the officer citing the violator is acting as agent or is assisting the officer who personally observed the violation, and as such, the knowledge of the officer observing the traffic violation is imputed to the officer citing the violator. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-364</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A peace officer may make an arrest without a warrant for an infraction of any of the six (6) statutes named in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.005ol11e" target="_self">KRS 431.005(1)(e)</a></cite> committed in his presence, with no other condition, however, a physical arrest is not mandatory; a peace officer may make an arrest without a warrant for an infraction of any other “violation,” as classified under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.060" target="_self">KRS 431.060</a></cite>, committed in his presence, if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant, if a citation is issued, will not appear in court at the designated time to answer the charge. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-445</cite>.
      </p>

       A peace officer may issue a citation, instead of making an arrest, for an infraction of any violation or misdemeanor committed in his presence if he has reasonable grounds to believe that the person cited will appear in court to answer the charge at the designated time. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-445</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the peace officer who issued a traffic citation fails to appear at the defendant’s arraignment and the defendant enters an appearance and pleads “not guilty,” the District Court might place it on the trial docket, in which event the case will be tried on the date set in the docket; on the other hand, if the court had previously had an understanding with the peace officer to be in court on the date designated in the citation, and he failed to show, then the court could strike the citation from the citation docket; however, the complaining officer could procure a summons through the county attorney and start over. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-485</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a peace officer issues a citation, pursuant to this section, charging a person with the violation of a city ordinance, and the person fails to appear in response to the citation, the District Court cannot acquire jurisdiction under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc24As24A.110ol12" target="_blank">KRS 24A.110(2)</a></cite> and cannot impose a fine against the person until the person is properly before the court, either by way of a voluntary personal appearance or pursuant to a warrant or summons. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-252</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The terms “citation” and “parking ticket” do not in fact mean the same thing since a citation may only be issued by a peace officer, must be given to an identifiable person, and can only be issued if the alleged act of wrongdoing was committed in the officer’s presence; while a parking ticket may be issued by someone other than a peace officer, may merely be left on an automobile, and does not require that the issuer know the identity of the operator of the vehicle. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-6</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A peace officer may not make an arrest for a misdemeanor or violation if the misdemeanor or violation is not committed in his presence and he may not issue a citation instead of making an arrest if the misdemeanor or violation is not committed in his presence. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-393</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a misdemeanor or violation committed in connection with a zoning ordinance is not committed in the presence of a peace officer, the officer would have to follow the procedures set forth in RCr 2.02 and 2.04 to obtain a warrant of arrest or summons for the violation or misdemeanor. A private person could follow such procedures to get a warrant of arrest or summons issued. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-393</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a dog warden does not possess the power of a police officer unless he is made a peace officer by being appointed as such, a dog warden who has not acquired the status of a police officer cannot utilize the provisions of this section and he has no legal authority to issue a citation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-597</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the county attorney or one of his assistants makes a motion to dismiss or strike several speeding citations which were issued due to radar, on the grounds that the officer who issued the citations had not been trained in the use of radar, the judge of the court could exercise his sound discretion and approve such dismissals. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-174</cite>.

       Under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.12.html#tXIIc150s150.090ol11" target="_blank">KRS 150.090(1)</a></cite>, conservation officers of the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources are peace officers to the extent of the enforcement of fish and game laws; they have express statutory authority to arrest without a warrant any citizen whom they observe in the act of violating such laws. Since under subsection (1) of this section, a peace officer may issue a citation instead of making an arrest for a misdemeanor committed in his presence, if there are reasonable grounds to believe the person cited will appear to answer the charge, a conservation officer may issue a citation, as authorized by subsections (1) and (2) of this section instead of making an arrest for a misdemeanor committed in the officer’s presence. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-287</cite>.

        Former section 39 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which was identical to subsection (1)
    of this section was construed as requiring only a substantial compliance, and not requiring its strict observance, where it was impractical or futile or where the officer had no reasonable opportunity to comply with it. Hayes v. Commonwealth, 458 S.W.2d 3, 1970 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 159</cite> (Ky. 1970).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Although the defendants were entitled to be informed of the offense for which they were being arrested, failure to so inform them was not a basis for excluding evidence concerning the arrest. Little v. Commonwealth, 438 S.W.2d 527, 1968 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 156</cite> (Ky. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the arresting officers were acting in an emergency and had no opportunity to inform the defendant of their intentions to arrest him for the offense of carrying a concealed deadly weapon, such arrest was valid even though defendant was not informed prior to arrest. Hayes v. Commonwealth, 458 S.W.2d 3, 1970 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 159</cite> (Ky. 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The conflict in proof as to whether officers had time to inform the defendant of the reason for his arrest made it proper for the court to overrule the motion for a directed verdict and to permit the jury to consider the issue under the self-defense instruction which was given for the benefit of the defendant. Clemons v. Commonwealth, 462 S.W.2d 919, 1971 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 562</cite> (Ky. 1971).

        Where negotiations to get decedent to come out of his residence had been fruitless and a SWAT and officer-canine teams stormed decedent’s residence in order to use nonlethal force to effectuate a quick arrest of decedent who had a knife, the officers did not use excessive force in firing bean bags and live rounds at decedent after he stabbed a police dog and then attacked the canine officer. Haugh v. City of Louisville, 242 S.W.3d 683, 2007 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 479</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2007).

        Where the assault and battery of which an officer was accused occurred in the course of an arrest, there was no need for an instruction on self-defense as such force as is necessary or reasonable to effect the arrest may be used.

       An officer may use that force which is necessary in order to make the arrest but he may not kill a misdemeanant unless the misdemeanant attacks him, in which case the officer may kill in self-defense. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 65-523</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a peace officer observes a driver of a motor vehicle committing the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol and chases such driver to his home where the driver locks himself in, the peace officer, after demanding of him that he open the door or suffer the door to be forced open, has the authority to effect a forcible entry into the offender’s home in order to arrest him without a warrant for the offense. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 70-193</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A police officer should not serve a warrant identifying the charge only as “Breaking and Entering” since it would not be sufficiently descriptive to inform the accused of the offense for which he is being arrested; however, warrant identifying the charge as “Breaking and Entering” with the proper Kentucky Revised Statute number would be sufficient. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-290</cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       No unnecessary force or violence shall be used in making an arrest and if such force is used, the officer may be held responsible in damages to the one he injured if he uses excessive force but to recover in a claim suit, the plaintiff must prove excessive force and its use in the performance of an official duty as distinguished from a personal act. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-498</cite>.

      <p>
       A third-class city ordinance restricting the use of city owned vehicles beyond one mile of the city limits except police vehicles in “hot pursuit” in felony situations is a proper exercise of legislative power and is not in conflict with any state statute concerning the law enforcement powers and duties of police. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-380</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a peace officer in hot pursuit has continued across corporate or county lines, as authorized by this section, for purposes of making an arrest outside of his jurisdiction, he may properly arrest a third person who is resisting the arrest of the original offender, as prohibited by <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc520s520.090" target="_blank">KRS 520.090</a></cite>, so long as the peace officer is in uniform or otherwise acting under the color of his authority. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-152</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While police officers of a sixth class city have a statutory obligation to rigidly enforce the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.16.html#tXVIc189s189.520" target="_blank">KRS 189.520</a></cite>, they can only enforce this statute or any other statute within their jurisdictional area of authority; generally, the jurisdiction of such police officers to arrest for offenses against the state is limited to the city limits of their particular city. However, where sixth class cities are operating under an interlocal agreement, the jurisdiction is extended to include the city limits of all of the cities which are parties to the agreement; also under the appropriate circumstances the jurisdiction of a sixth class city police officer could be expanded by the utilization of the concept of hot pursuit under this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-599</cite>.

       <p>
        A felony is a crime which is declared to be so by the statutory or common law of the jurisdiction. Blackburn v. Commonwealth, 314 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 22</cite>, 234 S.W.2d 178, 1950 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1015</cite> (Ky. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Kentucky legislature intended to include in its definition of “felony” only such crimes as are punishable under the civil authority of the states or union and not those with which the armed forces alone are concerned. Blackburn v. Commonwealth, 314 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 22</cite>, 234 S.W.2d 178, 1950 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1015</cite> (Ky. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc45s45.990ol13" target="_blank">KRS 45.990(3)</a></cite> does not have the definiteness to delineate a felony. Commonwealth v. McClure, 593 S.W.2d 92, 1979 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 501</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).

        2.— Army Desertion.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Desertion from the federal army is not a felony as defined in this section; thus, it was reversible error for the court to refuse to discharge the jury when, for the purpose of impeaching a defense witness’s testimony after he had denied conviction of a felony, the Commonwealth’s attorney asked the witness if he hadn’t been convicted for desertion. Blackburn v. Commonwealth, 314 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 22</cite>, 234 S.W.2d 178, 1950 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1015</cite> (Ky. 1950).

        3.Misdemeanor.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The offense of contempt of court is a misdemeanor and prosecution is limited to one (1) year. Gordon v. Commonwealth, 141 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 461</cite>, 133 S.W. 206, 1911 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 25</cite> (Ky. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        Engaging in prostitution, a misdemeanor for which the maximum punishment is a fine and one (1) year jail sentence, is not an infamous crime and therefore an indictment was not required. Eisner v. Commonwealth, 375 S.W.2d 825, 1964 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 439</cite> (Ky. 1964).

       <p>
        Though carrying a concealed deadly weapon is an “infamous offense” which can be prosecuted only by indictment, it is a misdemeanor rather than a felony. Elkin v.

        Corporation’s search of a pretrial detainee by requiring the detainee to provide a urine sample under its “direct observation” method was reasonable because (1) the detainee had a significantly reduced expectation of privacy because the detainee was on pre-trial release awaiting criminal prosecution and, as a condition of such release, had agreed to undergo drug testing, and (2) the government had a compelling interest in insuring the accuracy of the drug testing by preventing the detainee from giving a false specimen.

       <p>
        Based on the common meaning of single incident and its past precedent, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky concludes that the phrase “a series of Class D felony violations arising from a single incident” in Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.073" target="_self">431.073(</a></cite>1) refers to criminal offenses that were performed in the furtherance of an individual criminal episode and that were closely compressed in terms of time. Commonwealth v. Adams, 2017 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 622</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 13, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's four individual thefts did not arise from a single incident for purposes of a petition for expungement where, in each instance, defendant formed a separate criminal intent to steal heifers, he proceeded to fulfill his criminal objective, he had more than sufficient time to disassociate himself from the criminal act following each theft, and thus, he had been convicted of a series of Class D felonies that had not arisen out of the same incident. Commonwealth v. Adams, 2017 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 622</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Oct. 13, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in granting defendant's motion to expunge his felony convictions because passing bad checks on four different days at three different institutions over a 10-day period simply did not constitute the “single incident,” and the fact that the charges were grouped in a single indictment did not mean they arose from a single incident. Commonwealth v. Ford, 543 S.W.3d 579, 2018 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 76</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court of Appeals properly reversed the trial court’s order vacating and expunging defendant’s four theft convictions because, while the convictions involved only one victim, they did not arise from a “single incident” as the phrase was commonly understood and as contemplated by the expungement statute inasmuch as each of his thefts involved a temporally discrete criminal episode where in each instance, defendant formed a separate criminal intent to steal heifers, had more than a sufficient amount of time to disassociate himself from the criminal act after each incident, a successive incident occurred when he formed a new criminal intent and completed a separate and distinct theft. Adams v. Commonwealth, 599 S.W.3d 752, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 207</cite> (Ky. 2019).

       </p>

        Circuit court properly granted defendant’s application to vacate and expunge her prior felony conviction because the use of the word “or” in the statute clearly created two classes of persons eligible to apply for expungement, and defendant fell into the more expansive class of individuals eligible to apply for expungement.

        Appellant, who pled guilty to a felony, was not eligible for expungement; trial courts only had the power to expunge certain criminal charges that had been dismissed and certain misdemeanor charges, and this power was derived from <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.076" target="_self">KRS 431.076</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.078" target="_self">KRS 431.078</a></cite>, neither of which applied to appellant.

       <p>
        Former arrestee was not entitled to expungement of records regarding charges levied against him in 1996; the charges were dismissed without prejudice after a grand jury failed to return a true bill, and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.076" target="_self">KRS 431.076</a></cite> only applied where charges had been dismissed with prejudice.

        Where petitioner was charged with first-degree assault but the Commonwealth chose not to pursue the case and it was dismissed without prejudice and where petitioner, more than 10 years later, moved to expunge the case, the circuit court erred in granting the motion because <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.076ol11" target="_self">KRS 431.076(1)</a></cite> authorized expungement only in cases that were dismissed with prejudice. Further, the circuit court was without jurisdiction to consider the matter pursuant to CR 59.05 because petitioner sought relief more than 10 years after the order of dismissal was entered. Commonwealth v. Castillo, 2011 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 241</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2011), review denied, ordered not published, 2012 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>

        Appellee met the initial criteria for filing his motion to expunge because the charge against him was dismissed with prejudice, for purposes of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.076ol11" target="_self">KRS 431.076(1)</a></cite>, plus he waited more than 60 days after the order was entered before moving to expunge his records in accordance with § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.076ol12" target="_self">431.076(2)</a></cite>. Commonwealth v. Davis, 400 S.W.3d 286, 2013 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 75</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court found appellee’s records were improperly expunged, held that the doctrine of in pari materia does not apply because <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.076" target="_self">KRS 431.076</a></cite> is not inconsistent, and the statute applied because it concerns people who, like appellee, were charged with a criminal offense and the charges were subsequently dismissed with prejudice; it does not specify that the proceedings to which it refers need be criminal proceedings, and using the plain meaning of the word, the term proceedings may refer to either criminal or civil proceedings, and because there was a civil proceeding pending when the trial court entered its order granting the motion to expunge, the motion was improperly granted under the statute. Commonwealth v. Davis, 400 S.W.3d 286, 2013 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 75</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant pled guilty to illegal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a Class D felony, and successfully completed probation, the trial court lacked statutory authority to expunge the felony conviction. After the conviction was voided pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc218As218A.275" target="_blank">KRS 218A.275</a></cite>, the voided conviction was not tantamount to a charge dismissed with prejudice for purposes of the expungement statute. Commonwealth v. Jones, 406 S.W.3d 857, 2013 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 377</cite> (Ky. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly determined that defendant’s felony charges could not be expunged because they were either dismissed without prejudice or presented “No True Bill,” defendant did not allege constitutional infractions requiring expungement, there were no factual findings that her reasons outweighed the need of the Commonwealth to retain the records, and defendant was not entitled to have her records expunged as an instance that did not have statutory authority. Rhodes v. Commonwealth, 417 S.W.3d 762, 2013 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 170</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not have inherent authority to grant defendant’s expungement request because that was a statutory privilege that could not be extended by judicial fiat. Alexander v. Commonwealth, 556 S.W.3d 6, 2018 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 134</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court’s voiding and dismissing defendant’s conviction under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc218As218A.275ol19" target="_blank">KRS 218A.275(9)</a></cite> brought that offense within the parameters of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.076" target="_self">KRS 431.076</a></cite>, which permitted the expungement of a charge dismissed with prejudice, expungement of defendant’s felony conviction was proper.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Granting defendant expungement after he successfully completed a pretrial diversion program was proper as doing so would not preclude the Commonwealth from assessing defendant’s later eligibility for pretrial diversion; <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.076ol16" target="_self">KRS 431.076(6)</a></cite> provided that defendant could move the trial court to allow others to inspect his expunged record.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because a pardon did not have the effect of eliminating guilt or the fact of conviction, appellant could not maintain that he had been found not guilty of the offense or that his charges had been dismissed with prejudice under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.076ol11" target="_self">KRS 431.076(1)</a></cite>; thus, the trial court correctly denied appellant’s motion to expunge.

       <p>
        Appellant, who pled guilty to a felony, was not eligible for expungement; trial courts only had the power to expunge certain criminal charges that had been dismissed and certain misdemeanor charges, and this power was derived from <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.076" target="_self">KRS 431.076</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.078" target="_self">KRS 431.078</a></cite>, neither of which applied to appellant.

       <p>
        Trial court correctly denied appellant’s motion to expunge under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.078" target="_self">KRS 431.078</a></cite> because it only applied to the expungement of certain misdemeanor convictions and did not permit the expungement of felonies.

        <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.078" target="_self">KRS 431.078</a></cite> did not apply in this case because that statute concerns impingement for people who have been convicted of misdemeanors or violations, and appellee was charged with but not convicted of a felony, plus § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.078" target="_self">431.078 </a></cite>is quite specific as to who may have his records expunged under the statute: it states that it applies to people convicted of misdemeanors and violations, and it specifies that if criminal proceedings are pending against the person convicted, the records should not be expunged.

       <p>
        Where defendant pled guilty to illegal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, a Class D felony, and successfully completed probation, the trial court lacked statutory authority to expunge the felony conviction. After the conviction was voided pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.18.html#tXVIIIc218As218A.275" target="_blank">KRS 218A.275</a></cite>, the voided conviction was not tantamount to a charge dismissed with prejudice for purposes of the expungement statute.

       <p>
        Circuit court properly denied defendant’s requests to expunge his three violations of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 218A.1421(2)(a) where he did not contest that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.078" target="_self">431.078(</a></cite>4)(d) effectively precluded expungement of his convictions at issue. Fisher v.

        Circuit court erred in denying defendant’s motion to expunge the misdemeanor charge against her because it only reviewed whether the felony counts could be expunged, and made no specific findings pertaining to the statutory requirements or whether defendant satisfied the requirements for expungement of her misdemeanor conviction.

        Where law provides that a fine imposed on a railway company for failure to give statutory signal at grade crossings is “to be recovered by indictment,” such fine can only be recovered by indictment and not by penal action.

        A law which provides that a fine be recovered by an action in the name of the Commonwealth does not preclude collection of fine by indictment as an indictment is an action. Commonwealth v.

       In a suit to enforce a mortgage or judgment lien against real property which also secures a bail bond, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Administrative Office of the Courts, should be named as a party to the suit to represent the Commonwealth’s interest.

     Reparation for property stolen or damaged, from person convicted.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person convicted of a misdemeanor or felony for taking, injuring or destroying property shall restore the property or make reparation in damages if not ordered as a condition of probation. The court in which the conviction is had, if applied to by verified petition made within ninety (90) days of the date the sentence was pronounced, may order restitution or give judgment against the defendant for reparation in damages, and enforce collection by execution or other process. In a petition for restitution or reparation, the court shall cause the defendant, if in custody, to be brought into court, and demand of him if he has any defense to make to the petition. If he consents to the restitution or to reparation in damages in an agreed sum, the court shall give judgment accordingly. Otherwise a jury shall be impaneled to try the facts and ascertain the amount and the value of the property, or assess the damage, as the case may be. A failure to pursue this remedy shall not deprive the person aggrieved of his civil action for the injury sustained.

       Since insurers do not fall within the category of victims or aggrieved persons and where an insurer does not make its payment or settlement by virtue of being directly threatened or injured by a criminal defendant, an insurance payment or settlement is not a direct loss or injury as a result of criminal activity but is an indirect “loss” resulting from a contractual arrangement between the victim and the insurer; therefore, trial courts are not authorized to order restitution or reparation directly to an insurer as part of the criminal proceeding. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 94-57</cite>.

     Return of property stolen if accused does not appear.

     <p>
      If any person indicted for stealing property, or for having stolen property in his possession, breaks jail, forfeits his recognizance, or otherwise fails to appear for trial at the proper time, the person claiming the property may make a motion in the court in which the indictment is pending for the return of the property to him. The claim shall be supported by the affidavit of the person claiming the property. The motion shall be continued for thirty (30) days before final action is taken. A notice of the motion, served upon the attorney for the Commonwealth, shall be taken as a notice served upon the person named in the indictment, and shall give the court jurisdiction of the matter. The attorney for the Commonwealth shall defend the motion. A jury shall try the facts, and if it finds in its verdict that the claimant is entitled to the possession of the property, the court shall enter judgment accordingly. The court may enforce the judgment by rule, attachment and imprisonment as in cases of contempt. The costs of the proceedings shall be paid by the claimant, for which he may have judgment and execution against the person stealing the property.

     Procedure for challenging condemned person’s sanity.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="tXLc431s431.2135ol11">
       A condemned person or the person’s attorney may file a motion for stay of execution on the grounds that the condemned person is insane. The motion shall be filed in the Circuit Court of the county where the condemned person is incarcerated, or the county in which the condemned person was convicted, and shall be supported by at least two (2) affidavits. The Attorney General shall file a response within the time ordered by the court.
      </li>
      <li id="tXLc431s431.2135ol12">
       Upon receiving a motion under subsection (1) of this section, the court shall order the condemned person to be evaluated by at least two (2) licensed mental health professionals and shall order the mental health professionals to submit their written evaluation to the court within ten (10) days of the evaluation. The court shall then schedule and conduct a hearing as soon as possible to determine whether the condemned person is insane.
      </li>
      <li id="tXLc431s431.2135ol13">
       The court shall base its determination of insanity on a preponderance of the evidence. The court’s determination may be appealed to the Supreme Court by the condemned person or the Attorney General.
      </li>
      <li id="tXLc431s431.2135ol14">
       If the condemned person is determined to be insane, he or she shall be committed to the Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center. The treating psychiatrist shall then report, once each month or more frequently if the court orders, to the court and the condemned person’s counsel on the progress the condemned person has made and whether there is a substantial probability that the person will become sane. If at any time a psychiatrist treating or evaluating the person determines the person to be sane, the psychiatrist shall immediately report that fact to the court.

       </p>
       <p>
        Correction Cabinet’s (now Department of Corrections) defense to contempt charges based on its inability to comply with orders to take custody of certain prisoners was fundamentally flawed; the Kentucky Constitution assigns the responsibility for care and custody of convicted felons to state government as a whole; therefore, state government, which bears the burden for correcting overcrowding in prisons, was not unable to perform, even if this individual agency of the government could claim otherwise.

        The Governor of Kentucky’s policy concerning the signing of death warrants is strictly an executive function. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 926 S.W.2d 667, 1996 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 17</cite> (Ky.), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1223, 116 S. Ct. 1855, 134 L. Ed. 2d 955, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 3486 (U.S. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Governor’s policy of providing defense counsel up to three (3) days from the date of receipt of a death warrant request to respond in writing is not affected by RCr 11.42 (10), which serves as an outer time limit on the bringing of such actions and in no way affects the prerogatives of the Governor with respect to enforcement of criminal judgments. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 926 S.W.2d 667, 1996 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 17</cite> (Ky.), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1223, 116 S. Ct. 1855, 134 L. Ed. 2d 955, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 3486 (U.S. 1996).

       <p>
        Federal Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (28 USCS 2244) affects neither the time for filing a motion under RCr 11.42 for postconviction relief nor the Governor’s authority to set an execution date under this section.

       If a warrant is issued by a District Court for an offense committed in a city, then the warrant would have to be served by the police department of the city if the warrant is to be served within the city limits, and if the district court issues a summons and places it in the hands of the sheriff, then the sheriff will have to serve the summons even though he is found in the city of his residence, but if the summons or warrant is issued by the Circuit Court, and the warrant or summons is directed to the sheriff, then the sheriff will have to serve it, regardless of whether the defendant can be found in a city or within the unincorporated area of the county. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-403</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the warrant is issued by a District Court for an offense committed within the city, and the defendant may be found in the unincorporated area of the county, then the District Court can place the warrant in the hands of the sheriff for service of process. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-403</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the nature and purpose of the summons differs from that of the warrant and the criminal rules have made separate provisions for the summons (RCr 2.10), and the language of this section makes no apparent attempt to alter these rules, the summons may be served by any peace officer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-662</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A police officer of a city of the sixth class, whose jurisdiction to arrest for offenses against the state is confined to the municipal limits, has no authority to serve criminal process outside the municipal boundaries; while generally the courts may determine the particular peace officer required to serve criminal process out of their courts, they must recognize the geographical jurisdictional limitations of police officers of sixth-class cities. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-68</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, providing that city police officers must serve warrants within city limits, is unenforceable, since it is in direct conflict with the law dealing with the nature and service of warrants of arrest as reflected in RCr. 2.06 and RCr. 2.10 and, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXLIc447s447.154" target="_blank">KRS 447.154</a></cite>, the statute must give way to the Criminal Rules. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-343</cite>.

       The court issuing a warrant of arrest has the authority to place the warrant for service with any peace officer of the county it chooses, including the sheriff. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-343</cite>.
      </p>

       A county sheriff can serve a warrant, issued by any court in his county and delivered to him for service, anywhere within his county boundaries, including city boundaries in his county and even where the offense is committed in the city. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-343</cite>.

        Inasmuch as the Bail Bonding Act of 1976 does not pertain to specific organizations or individuals, but does describe classes of activities in which individuals and corporations shall not engage, and inasmuch as the act does not provide for retroactive punishment, but provides penalties only for those who engage in the business of bailbonding after the date of the act, the act is not unconstitutional as a bill of attainder.

LEXIS 15395 (W.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1977</cite>), aff'd, 625 F.2d 737, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 17746 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1980</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the constitutionality of this section had been upheld by a state Circuit Court in a class action brought by licensed bail bondsmen, the bondsmen were precluded from asserting the constitutional issue again in the federal court. Benboe v. Carroll, 494 F. Supp. 462, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15395 (W.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1977</cite>), aff'd, 625 F.2d 737, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 17746 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1980</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bail Bonding Act of 1976 applies equally to all citizens, whether they be residents of Kentucky or not, thus there was no merit to a claim by licensed bail bondsmen that the act violated their privileges, immunities and their equal protection rights. Benboe v. Carroll, 494 F. Supp. 462, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15395 (W.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1977</cite>), aff'd, 625 F.2d 737, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 17746 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1980</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The elimination of commercial bail bonding businesses is a constitutional exercise of the police power of the State to protect its citizens from a business found to be detrimental to their welfare.

       A county fiscal court may not adopt rules and regulations which would close the county jail between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. to pretrial investigation in determining bail and to the trial commissioner for establishing bail, so that an individual arrested at night would be housed for at least eight (8) hours before he could make bail, since the bail bond provisions of RCr 4.00 to RCr 4.58 and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.510" target="_self">KRS 431.510</a></cite> to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.550" target="_self">431.550 </a></cite>reflects the legislative policy that, if pretrial release is to be effected at all, it should be done quickly to preserve the presumption of innocence, and since the practical effect of excluding bail officers for the stated period would be arbitrary denial of bail contrary to Const., § 2 proscription against arbitrary action. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-299</cite>.

        Language in the forfeiture of bond statute, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.545" target="_self">KRS 431.545</a></cite>, and forfeiture of bond criminal rule, RCr 4.42, clearly indicated that the General Assembly intended that courts had the option to forfeit bonds for violations of non-financial conditions of the bond. A trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the forfeiture of $5,000 of a $20,000 bond where the evidence clearly showed that defendant violated conditions of his pre-trial release bond that prohibited the consumption of alcohol and required defendant to obey a curfew; defendant was caught out drinking after the curfew time.

       Where a defendant has willfully failed to comply with the conditions of a bail bond, resulting in a forfeiture being ordered by the court, and a lien on real estate is involved so that notice of the forfeiture is sent to the county clerk pursuant to RCr 4.48, the proper officer to execute the lien would be the county sheriff of the county in which the real property is situated, or his deputy, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc70s70.070" target="_blank">KRS 70.070</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-215</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a suit to enforce a mortgage or judgment lien against real property which also secures a bail bond, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Administrative Office of the Courts, should be named as a party to the suit to represent the Commonwealth’s interest. In addition to service on the Administrative Office of the Courts, the plaintiff should serve a copy of the complaint on the county attorney for the county in which the action is filed since the county attorney usually represents the Commonwealth in such an action. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-127</cite>.

        Where a physician, in contemplation of a pending suit by a party to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the alleged negligence of another, treated the party in a professional way for the purpose of making evidence that would sustain the action that was soon afterwards brought, when he knew the party was not injured, he was not guilty of contempt and could not be proceeded against or punished by contempt proceedings, although he might have been proceeded against and punished by indictment. If, however, in a pending suit, a physician had been guilty of this conduct, it would have been a contempt of court. Melton v. Commonwealth, 160 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 642</cite>, 170 S.W. 37, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 528</cite> (Ky. 1914) (Ky. 1914).

        An affidavit to require a judge to vacate bench because of prejudice, which contains statements unnecessarily reflecting on the honor and integrity of the court, is contemptuous, and prohibition will not lie to restrain the judge from punishing litigant for contempt.

        An attorney appointed as guardian ad litem may be punished for contempt if he refuses to act without justification, but he may rightly refuse to act if infant has not been brought within the jurisdiction of the court by proper service of process.

        Circuit Court had discretionary power, in case of refusal of defendants to obey orders to appear and give depositions as on cross-examination, to strike defendants’ pleadings and enter default judgment for plaintiff but, where some of defendants’ pleadings appeared to present a good defense and plaintiff could have established part of allegations of his petition without aid of evidence withheld by defendants, it was an abuse of discretion to impose such punishment for the contempt. Court could, however, issue a rule giving notice to defendants that such punishment would be imposed if defendants did not comply with orders within a stated time. Crook v. Schumann, 292 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 750</cite>, 167 S.W.2d 836, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 150</cite> (Ky. 1942).

       <p>
        Defendants who refused, on advice of their attorney, to obey orders of the court directing them to appear and give depositions as on cross-examination were guilty of contempt, notwithstanding that their refusal was based on an honest conviction that the court had no right to compel their depositions prior to determination of question as to whether plaintiff had capacity to sue. Crook v. Schumann, 292 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 750</cite>, 167 S.W.2d 836, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 150</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        It is the duty of parties to an action to obey the orders of the court, whether right or wrong, and any person who aids in the evasion of an order of court, or incites others to such conduct, is guilty of contempt. Crook v. Schumann, 292 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 750</cite>, 167 S.W.2d 836, 1942 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 150</cite> (Ky. 1942).

        Where contempt consists of statements susceptible to construction that they were intended to reflect on integrity of the judge, opportunity should be afforded offender to purge himself of the contempt by explanation, apology or retraction.

        Family Court properly exercised its contempt powers in sentencing appellant to complete domestic violence counseling, even though the domestic violence order (DVO) had expired prior to the contempt hearing, because the Family Court was not attempting to enforce the defunct DVO but to punish appellant for his contumacious behavior.

        A “civil contempt” consists of failure to do something which is ordered by the court to be done for the benefit of another party to a proceeding before the court, while “criminal contempts” are acts in disrespect of the court or its process which obstruct administration of justice or tend to bring the court into disrepute. Jones v. Commonwealth, 308 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 233</cite>, 213 S.W.2d 983, 1948 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 876</cite> (Ky. 1948), overruled, Levisa Stone Corp. v.

        Where a person was merely a spectator in a courtroom and not sworn as a witness in any action pending before the court, he could not be held guilty of criminal contempt for refusing to answer the judge’s questions, because the judge had no authority to conduct an inquiry to ascertain whether offenses had been committed.

        A justice who, within his jurisdiction, has one imprisoned for civil or criminal contempt is not liable in damages to the one imprisoned. McBurnie v. Sullivan, 152 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 686</cite>, 153 S.W. 945, 1913 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 698</cite> (Ky. 1913). See Bryant v.

       <p>
        A judgment punishing for contempt would have been no bar to a criminal proceeding for violation of the law. Underhill v. Murphy, 117 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 640</cite>, 78 S.W. 482, 25 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1731</cite>, 1904 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 227</cite> (Ky. 1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are some offenses that are at the same time contempts of court and indictable crimes and, in this class of cases, punishment for contempt will not bar punishment under indictment for the larger offense. Melton v. Commonwealth, 160 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 642</cite>, 170 S.W. 37, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 528</cite> (Ky. 1914) (Ky. 1914).

        It is essential that the court acquire jurisdiction over the offender before punishment for contempt may be imposed. Lyons v. Bryan, 273 S.W.2d 838, 1954 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1214</cite> (Ky. 1954).

        Attorney’s affidavit in support of a motion to require circuit judge to vacate bench, which contained matter and innuendoes beyond the relevant facts necessary to show that the judge would not afford his client a fair and impartial trial, justified the judge’s issuance of rule against attorney to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt, and petition for writ of prohibition against the judge was denied by Court of Appeals. Marshall v. Hancock, 300 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 295</cite>, 188 S.W.2d 477, 1945 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 545</cite> (Ky. 1945).

       <p>
        There was no violation of the defendant’s right to equal protection of the law where he was convicted of accepting a bribe, although the person claimed to have given the bribe was only to be tried for attempted bribery. Fanelli v. Commonwealth, 423 S.W.2d 255, 1968 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 479</cite> (Ky. 1968) (decision prior to 1975 amendment).

        2.— Officer.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In order to violate this section, the bribe must be taken or agreed to while the person is an officer and, therefore, any agreement made prior to the officer’s election does not violate this section. Tharp v. Nolan, 119 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 870</cite>, 84 S.W. 1168, 27 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 326</cite>, 1905 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       </p>
       <p>
        A water commissioner is an officer within the meaning of this section. Commonwealth v. Howard, 379 S.W.2d 475, 1964 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 247</cite> (Ky. 1964) (decision prior to 1975 amendment).

       <p>
        Section 39 of the Kentucky Constitution does not exclusively vest in the General Assembly the power to try those charged with bribery or attempted bribery of members of the legislature. Campbell v. Commonwealth, 229 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 264</cite>, 17 S.W.2d 227, 1929 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 756</cite> (Ky. 1929) (decision prior to 1975 amendment).

       <p>
        Where the defendant attorney was convicted of accepting a bribe, the offense involved moral turpitude warranting his disbarment. Kentucky State Bar Asso. v. Howard, 437 S.W.2d 171, 1969 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 423</cite> (Ky. 1969) (decision prior to 1975 amendment).

       <p>
        A Commonwealth’s attorney accused of accepting a bribe to quash indictments may be prosecuted either for the common-law offense of malfeasance in office or under this section, but the punishment assessed is limited to that prescribed under this section. Commonwealth v. Rowe, 112 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 482</cite>, 66 S.W. 29, 23 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1718</cite>, 1902 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       <p>
        Court erred in directing verdict of acquittal on bribery charge where there was evidence that director of building and housing had agreed on payment of a certain sum to a third party in return for dropping condemnation proceedings against certain property even though defendant had never touched the money himself. Commonwealth v. Hillebrand, 508 S.W.2d 566, 1974 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 613</cite> (Ky. 1974) (decision prior to 1975 amendment).

        An indictment which alleged that defendant accepted money for an election committee with intent to influence mayor, but which failed to allege that the mayor received the money or had knowledge of and assented to the illegal intent did not charge a violation of this section. Commonwealth v. Smith, 536 S.W.2d 457, 1976 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 77</cite> (Ky. 1976), appeal denied, Smith v. Kentucky, 423 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 210, 46 L.

       Opinions of Attorney General.
      </h4>
      <p>
       All private cars, including those of peace officers, are prohibited from being equipped with any radio or other apparatus which is capable of either receiving or transmitting messages within the wave length or channel allocated for the purposes of police radios. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 66-495</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of an organization known as REACT whose vehicles are equipped with radios capable of receiving police calls would be in violation of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 70-368</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The possession and use of a mobile radio set in a constable’s car with the transmitter and receiver on a police frequency relating to the communications system of the local city police would make the constable subject to the application of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-281</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriffs of Kentucky and their deputies may use mobile radio communication equipment in their privately-owned vehicles in connection with their law enforcement and official duties, which equipment has been purchased by a fiscal court pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc70s70.210" target="_blank">KRS 70.210</a></cite> without violating subsection (1) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-494</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is immaterial whether or not a radio set in an automobile is connected. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 72-817</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the owner of a filling station who repairs police cars may have such cars for several days during servicing and the city has installed a police radio system in the owner’s private car for convenience, such installation is illegal and his appointment as a special policeman or auxiliary policeman would not cure such illegality. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 73-690</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the word “person” under subsection (21) (now subsection (27)) of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXLIc446s446.010" target="_blank">KRS 446.010</a></cite> may include a corporation unless the context requires otherwise and since this section provides for an alternative punishment of fine or jail time, a corporation can come within the meaning of “person” as such word is used in this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-888</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “capable” as used in the first sentence of subsection (1) of this section would include a radio set that may be converted by various simple adjustments to receive police broadcasts. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-888</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “mobile” does not exclude a radio set utilized in an abode, regardless of the source of power or method of installation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-888</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.16.html#tXVIc189s189.950" target="_blank">KRS 189.950</a></cite> and this section, the fiscal court does not have the authority to permit county auxiliary policemen to install flashing blue lights or police radios on their cars. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-500</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession of radios capable of monitoring or transmitting police frequencies is illegal, and this includes merchants unless they only repair for or sell such radios to authorized individuals. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-10</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       As used in subsection (1) of this section in the phrase “any mobile radio set or apparatus” the term “mobile” modifies “radio set” only, not “apparatus” and thus the use or possession of any radio device or equipment, whether it be mobile or stationary, capable of intercepting or interfering with the wave length or channel assigned to the police by the F.C.C. is prohibited. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-92</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A radio station can legally put a scanner that would receive only police broadcasts and not transmit in a mobile unit. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-384</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “newspaper reporters and photographers” used in this section is broad enough to include news reporters of the entire news media, i.e., television, radio, newspapers and magazines, since if the exception were narrowly restricted to newspaper reporters, it would be unconstitutional, since it would be arbitrary. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-384</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of police scanners in the “private automobiles” owned by official or professional members of the news media is legal under the statute in question. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-608</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is impermissibly vague as applied to radar detectors because it does not adequately connote or embrace the use of radar detectors within the existing prohibition protecting the effectiveness of essential police radio communications. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-154</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chief of a fire department has no authority to permit fire fighters within his department and under his command to install radios in their private vehicles for use in the performance of their official duties if those radios are capable of receiving or transmitting police messages. Only those persons and organizations who can bring themselves within the exemptions and exceptions set forth in this section are permitted to use or possess such radios. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-126</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city police department is not required on the basis of subsections (1) to (4) of this section to authorize constables to use a radio system operating on a frequency licensed to the city or its police department for police use, or to provide to constables, radio dispatching and information support services. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 95-20</cite>.

       A peace officer, security agent of a mercantile establishment, merchant or merchant’s employee who has probable cause for believing that goods held for sale by the merchant have been unlawfully taken by a person may take the person into custody and detain him in a reasonable manner for a reasonable length of time, on the premises of the mercantile establishment or off the premises of the mercantile establishment, if the persons enumerated in this section are in fresh pursuit, for any or all of the following purposes:

        As the more specific statute, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky interprets Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc433s433.236" target="_self">433.236 </a></cite>as controlling in cases of shoplifting. When an individual has committed larceny in a retail or wholesale store, a police officer may effectuate an arrest of such individual under § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc433s433.236" target="_self">433.236.</a></cite> Conversely, the Court of Appeals interprets Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.015" target="_self">431.015 </a></cite>as generally applying to other misdemeanor offenses committed in the officer's presence. Burdette v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In an action by a customer against a store owner for alleged false imprisonment committed when the store’s security employee took custody of and detained the customer as a suspected shoplifter, the store owner had the burden of proving its defense of probable cause as justification for taking custody of and detaining the customer. Consolidated Sales Co. v. Malone, 530 S.W.2d 680, 1975 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 55</cite> (Ky. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by a customer against a store owner for alleged false imprisonment committed when the store’s security employee took custody of and detained the customer as a suspected shoplifter, defensive evidence that the security employee had acted in good faith and had treated the customer in a reasonable manner was sufficient for a jury question on the issue of probable cause. Consolidated Sales Co. v. Malone, 530 S.W.2d 680, 1975 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 55</cite> (Ky. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a store owner did not plead the defense of probable cause as justification for taking custody of and detaining a suspected shoplifting customer, but where evidence which had no relevancy to any other purpose was admitted without objection in the customer’s action for false imprisonment, the reception of such evidence was tantamount to an amendment of the store owner’s answer to cover the issue of probable cause. Consolidated Sales Co. v. Malone, 530 S.W.2d 680, 1975 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 55</cite> (Ky. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        A police officer may arrest a shoplifter without a warrant solely on the information provided by the merchant even though the misdemeanor was not committed in his presence. Superx Drugs of Kentucky, Inc. v. Rice, 554 S.W.2d 903, 1977 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 783</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by a customer against a store owner for alleged false imprisonment and malicious prosecution, the customer’s action of the placing of items in her purse, even if only partially hidden from view, was sufficient to give the store personnel reason to invoke subsection (1) of this section; therefore, her claims for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution failed and the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in favor of the store owner. Taylor Drugstores, Inc. v. Story, 760 S.W.2d 102, 1988 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 137</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1988).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A merchant’s limited privilege to recover goods believed to have been stolen includes the privilege to detain the person for the time necessary to make a reasonable investigation of the facts. Superx Drugs of Kentucky, Inc. v. Rice, 554 S.W.2d 903, 1977 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 783</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for false imprisonment, plaintiff can recover damages only for that mental suffering and embarrassment endured during the period prior to her arrest and, thus, $75,000 compensatory damage award was clearly excessive where plaintiff was detained less than one hour prior to her arrest and was treated respectfully. Superx Drugs of Kentucky, Inc. v. Rice, 554 S.W.2d 903, 1977 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 783</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc433s433.236" target="_self">KRS 433.236</a></cite> authorized a store employee’s investigation into a possible shoplifting incident and detention of a customer for a reasonable amount of time, when such was coupled with the fact that the evidence showed that she was not mistreated in any way, the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in favor of that employee and his employer. Messer v. Robinson, 250 S.W.3d 344, 2008 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 75</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Ultimately, the question of whether a detention was lawful is one of fact to be resolved by a jury under proper instructions from the trial court. As in all cases involving questions of fact, the weight to be given to conflicting evidence and the credibility to be afforded each witness remains within the province of the jury. It is entitled to accept the plaintiff’s version of the incident and reject the defendant’s version or vice versa. Kessack v. Kentucky Bar Ass'n, 877 S.W.2d 615, 1994 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 67</cite> (Ky. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant was not entitled to summary judgment in an action for false imprisonment and the intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from the detention of the plaintiff after the store’s inventory and theft control device set off a sensor alarm as the plaintiff left the store where the defendant asserted (1) that the entire episode lasted no more than 30 minutes, (2) that its employees acted reasonably in the manner and in the length of time they detained the plaintiff, and (3) that the inquiries they made of her were reasonable under the circumstances, but the plaintiff asserted (1) that she was detained by store employees for approximately 45 minutes, (2) that she was subjected to humiliation, (3) that one of the employees told her to sit on a bench near the front of the store and then pushed a shopping cart in front of her to prevent her from leaving, (4) that the store manager was dilatory in responding to her detention, and (5) that the situation could have been dealt with more effectively, efficiently, and reasonably if the defendant had only fulfilled her persistent request to inspect her purse. Birdsong v. Wal-Mart Stores, 74 S.W.3d 754, 2001 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 67</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2001).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In action by customer against store for false arrest and imprisonment, clerk’s testimony of the plaintiff’s prior guilty plea to misdemeanor of theft by deception had no probative value on the issue of mitigation of damages where store made no showing that prior guilty plea lessened plaintiff’s humiliation and, under the well-settled case law, it could not properly have been admitted for any other reason. Considering the nature of the evidence and its effect of impeaching plaintiff’s wife’s testimony that she was not aware of any criminal record of plaintiff, the error in admitting the evidence was clearly prejudicial. Daugherty v. Kuhn's Big K Store, 663 S.W.2d 748, 1983 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 394</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized from her purse and person following her arrest for shoplifting was properly denied where Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc433s433.236" target="_self">433.236,</a></cite> rather than Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc431s431.015" target="_self">431.015,</a></cite> was the controlling statute, and under that statute, and thus, her arrest was lawful. Burdette v.

        Unpublished decision:
    District court improperly granted summary judgment to a retailer on false imprisonment claim on the basis of the “shopkeeper's privilege” affirmative defense because the district court impermissibly shifted the burden to the customer to refute the affirmative defense. In doing so, it violated both summary judgment procedure and the underlying substantive law that places the burden of proving an affirmative defense on the retailer.

He would only have the power of detention given under this section and he would have the same detention authority as any other employee of the establishment. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 68-498</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Detention under this section would not be authorized beyond the time reasonably necessary to ascertain that the property has been taken and to regain possession. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 69-64</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an individual is being detained against his will, he has a right to know the reason for the detention and a request must be made for the return of the merchandise. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 69-64</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the retailer either states to a police officer that he saw merchandise concealed by the person accused or produces a witness who saw the taking, the police officer would have probable cause for arresting the accused. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 69-64</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) (now (3)) of this section extends the peace officer’s power of arrest and he may arrest without a warrant regardless of the value of the merchandise taken. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 69-64</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under circumstances in which the concealment is such that the merchant can reasonably believe that the concealment is with the intent to steal, a merchant may detain a person on the premises, but to detain a person off the premises, the merchant must be in fresh pursuit. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 69-64</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the “shoplifting law,” the merchant or his employee may use reasonable force to detain a person he believes has concealed merchandise and has not paid for it but he may not use such force as would threaten serious bodily harm to the person and should refrain from laying hands on the person or using any force, either implied or actual, unless it is necessary to detain the person for the purpose of recovering the merchandise. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 69-64</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1) of this section allows detention, which is not an arrest, for shoplifting by both commissioned and noncommissioned security officers while subsection (2) (now (3)) allows a peace officer to arrest for a misdemeanor involving larceny on probable cause without a warrant, and a misdemeanor involving larceny offenses includes petit larceny under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc433s433.230" target="_self">KRS 433.230</a></cite> (now repealed) and shoplifting under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc433s433.234" target="_self">KRS 433.234</a></cite> as shoplifting involves a “larceny” under common law definition. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-94</cite>.

The recommended sanction was appropriate in light of the attorney’s extensive history of prior discipline for serious ethical violations and the seriousness of the charges. Ky. Bar Ass'n v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in awarding an attorney summary judgment in a trust’s action alleging she filed an illegal attorney’s lien because no evidence supported the claim; the lien was not forged, did not contain any false statements, and was not a false claim for money not due the attorney; the attorney had an order from the district court appointing her specifying her hourly rate and that she was be to be paid from the trust’s assets, and she removed the lien after the trust filed suit.
    Ford v. Faller, 439 S.W.3d 173, 2014 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 114</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        General Assembly’s purpose in adopting the illegal lien statute was to protect individuals from liens that are forged, false, or fraudulent, and in the case of an attorney’s lien, the illegal lien statute would be violated where an attorney filed a lien related to a matter for which she never worked, misrepresented the nature of fee she was due, or the like; the statute was not designed to criminalize a mistaken legal interpretation.
    Ford v. Faller, 439 S.W.3d 173, 2014 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 114</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if an attorney’s lien was improper, it was not groundless because the attorney had a reasonable argument that the law had to be interpreted, applied, modified, and/or extended to allow her to file her lien; the definition of groundless, i.e., lacking any factual or legal basis or rationale, is appropriate and in accord with the General Assembly’s intent and purpose.
    Ford v. Faller, 439 S.W.3d 173, 2014 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 114</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2014).

        Merchants and hunters, or merchandising and hunting, are properly of such different classes, and so designated and treated in the Sunday closing law, that there can be no denial of equal protection in the enforcement of the law relating to one of the classes but not the other.

        Where the trial judge dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint of alleged discrimination by taking judicial notice that indictments against 10 other businesses for violations were pending before the court, the dismissal was in error since the other indictments had been continued and therefore did not refute the plaintiff’s claim of discrimination.

       </p>
       <p>
        A city ordinance providing for Sunday closing was invalid for to the extent it duplicated the state statute it accomplished no purpose and to the extent it defined a term found in the statute it could not be given the force of law.

        Where the Court of Appeals had previously judicially interpreted a “work of necessity” as not including some of the items permitted by a city ordinance, the conflict between the statute and the ordinance rendered the ordinance invalid.

        In enacting subsection (4) of this section the General Assembly intended the expression “continuous work scheduling” to mean every day rather than every hour, and thus an employer who routinely operates his business for a substantial period of time each and every day of the week may operate it on Sundays if each of his employees is allowed at least one (1) full day off during each calendar week.

       A city may adopt an ordinance authorizing the operation of a pool or billiard hall on Sunday subject to the provisions of subsection (3) (c) (now (4)(c)) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 72-577</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the regulatory authority of this section and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc436s436.160" target="_self">KRS 436.160</a></cite> a city may, subject to the restrictions in subsection (1) of this section, establish reasonable hours during which the applicable establishment may remain open on Sunday. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-533</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The repeal of the statutory prohibition on retail sales on Sunday did not authorize the operation of a pool hall but merely gave a city or county the authority to permit such an operation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-211</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A pool hall may not operate on Sunday unless the local legislative body has adopted an ordinance authorizing such an operation subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-211</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The playing of a game of pool does not constitute a retail sale and thus a local ordinance authorizing retail sales on Sunday does not authorize the operation of a pool hall. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-211</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under an appropriate city ordinance, an amusement establishment containing various coin-operated machines could remain open on Sunday. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-93</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any fiscal court in Kentucky can enact an ordinance pursuant to subsection (2) of this section permitting certain retail activities on Sunday. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-762</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While a city can no longer utilize the provisions of the Sunday Closing Law under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc436s436.160" target="_self">KRS 436.160</a></cite> and this section to prohibit a pool hall from operating on Sunday if that establishment is routinely operated for a substantial period of time each and every day of the week and if each of the employees of that establishment is allowed one-full day off during each calendar week, the city, under its police powers to protect the public moral and the general welfare of its citizens pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc82s82.082" target="_blank">KRS 82.082</a></cite>, may enact reasonable ordinances to regulate the operation, as to the hours of operation and location, of pool halls within the city limits. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-298</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section relates specifically to retail sales and activities, but a private manufacturing facility or business would not be regulated by this statute as it does not meet the definition of retail sales and activities, and to do so would be to stretch the definition beyond its logical intent; however, private manufacturing facilities and businesses are subject to the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc436s436.160" target="_self">KRS 436.160</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 95-38</cite>.

       <p>
        Within the meaning of this section, an ordinary pool table is similar to a pigeon-hole table, and embraces it therein, the tables resembling in general the same characteristics, and game being played alike. Commonwealth v. Nance, 158 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 444</cite>, 165 S.W. 423, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 637</cite> (Ky. 1914).

       <p>
        The owner of a poolroom is liable for the acts of his agent to whom he had entrusted the operation of his business in permitting minor to play without written consent of his parent. Dezarn v. Commonwealth, 195 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 686</cite>, 243 S.W. 921, 1922 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 391</cite> (Ky. 1922).

Erlanger Kennel Club v. Daugherty, 213 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 648</cite>, 281 S.W. 826, 1926 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 588</cite> (Ky. 1926), aff'd, 275 U.S. 509, 48 S. Ct. 158, 72 L.

        In a case dealing with pari-mutuel wagering on historic horse racing, further proceedings in the trial court were required to determine whether the licensed operation of wagering on historical racing runs afoul of the Penal Code’s gambling provisions. Appalachian Racing, LLC v. Family Trust Found. of Ky., Inc., 423 S.W.3d 726, 2014 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 88</cite> (Ky. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the Supreme Court held that the Exacta system does not create a wagering pool among patrons such that they are wagering among themselves as required for pari-mutuel wagering, the trial court misapplied the applicable regulation as a matter of law. The trial court erred in concluding that pari-mutuel wagering does not require patrons to wager on the same horse races, nor does it require reciprocity among patrons.

       Investigators employed by the Kentucky State Humane Federation who were sworn in as peace officers must serve in the county of their appointment and did not have statewide authority to enforce the former statutes relating to cruelty and mistreatment of animals which are now repealed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 67-484</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A humane society is a private nonprofit corporation whose agents have powers of peace officers for the purpose of enforcing Kentucky law relating to cruelty to animals, provided such agents possess the qualifications required of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.300" target="_blank">KRS 61.300</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-516</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       All humane society agents must actually qualify as peace officers by complying with the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.300" target="_blank">KRS 61.300</a></cite> before they legally possess the powers of peace officers. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-400</cite>.

       An agent of the humane society, acting as the city’s animal control officer, who has actually qualified as a nonelective peace officer by complying with the requirements of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.300" target="_blank">KRS 61.300</a></cite> and who has the powers of a peace officer only for the purpose of enforcing the statutory provisions relating to cruelty and mistreatment of animals, is not required to be bonded. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-400</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An agent of the humane society should be appointed by written authority of the society and possess proper identification, and dismissal of an agent by the society not only nullifies the agent’s right to serve as an officer of the society but also cancels his authority to serve as a peace officer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-400</cite>.

        Refusal of trial court to admit evidence as to absence of coercion or disturbance during religious meetings at which snakes were displayed and handled, and to permit scriptural passages upon which beliefs and practices were based to be read to the jury, was not error since neither breach of the peace nor the intent of the violator is an element of the offense denounced.

     Findings of the General Assembly.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the caring, rearing, feeding, breeding, and sale of animals and animal products, and the use of animals in research, testing, and education, represents vital segments of the economy of the state, that producers and others involved in the production and sale of animals and animal products and the use of animals in research and education have a vested interest in protecting the health and welfare of animals and the physical and intellectual property rights which they have in animals, and that there has been an increasing number of illegal acts committed against farm animal and research facilities. The General Assembly further finds that these illegal acts threaten the production of agricultural products, and jeopardize crucial scientific, biomedical, or agricultural research, and finally, the General Assembly finds that these illegal acts threaten the public safety by exposing communities to contagious diseases and damage research.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This is a penal statute which must be literally and strictly construed so there would be no violation if a person smokes a cigar or pipe but it would be a violation for anyone to smoke cigarettes in a school corridor or auditorium while children are present for lawful purposes, regardless of whether it is during or after school hours, or for a spectator to smoke cigarettes at a school football game being played on school grounds, but a person may smoke cigarettes during a summer tennis or baseball program conducted by a local recreation board and where no children are assembled. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 73-175</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of this section is a misdemeanor and any peace officer may make an arrest or issue a citation for a misdemeanor committed in his presence or a citizen who witnesses a misdemeanor may go before a judge or magistrate and file a sworn complaint whereupon a warrant will be issued for the arrest of the misdemeanant. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 73-175</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it is against the law to smoke on school property, cigarettes may not be sold on such property nor may the school designate an area outside building but on school grounds for student smoking. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-862</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every school in the state can have a designated smoking room for the adult employees of the school system pursuant to this section; however, under this section, only secondary schools located in counties containing a city of the first or second class, as set forth in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc81s81.010" target="_blank">KRS 81.010</a></cite>, or an urban-county government, can have a designated smoking area for both adults and students; accordingly, a county which does not contain a city of the first or second class or an urban-county government may only designate a smoking room for adult employees of the school system, since designating such an area by regulation for the benefit of non-employee adults and students would violate this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-295</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county board of education in a county not containing a first or second class city or an urban-county government has no legal authority to designate a smoking area for non-employee adults or for school students since the geographical scope of this section goes to “any part of any school building used for school purposes, or upon school grounds, while children are assembled there for lawful purposes”; accordingly, this section precludes smoking in a school corridor or auditorium or even at a football game on school grounds while children are present for lawful purposes regardless of whether it is during or after school hours. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-295</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, as it is written, proscribes only the smoking of tobacco products; however, the board of education, under the authority of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc160s160.290" target="_blank">KRS 160.290</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.13.html#tXIIIc160s160.340" target="_blank">KRS 160.340</a></cite>, may regulate the use of tobacco products including the use of snuff or chewing tobacco in ways other than smoking by its employees, other adults or students. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-295</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the current statutes, every school may have a designated smoking room for adult employees of the school system, and every secondary school may have a designated smoking area for all individuals, adults and students. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-119</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not grant authority to superintendents or principals beyond that authority granted to those officials by the Board, and, as currently written, does not forbid smoking of tobacco products at outdoor athletic events, depending on what smoking areas are to be designated in the schools. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-137</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority concerning the use of all tobacco products by employees, students and visitors in school buildings, on school grounds or on field trips rests with the local board of education, not with superintendents and principals, unless that authority is delegated to them by the board. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-137</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section dealing with smoking on school premises directly conflicts with <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.165" target="_blank">KRS 61.165</a></cite> which requires governmental buildings that have adopted a policy limiting smoking to provide an indoor smoking room. This section controls because it is the more specific statute; therefore, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.165" target="_blank">KRS 61.165</a></cite>, which requires that indoor smoking areas be provided in governmental buildings where smoking is restricted, does not apply to school districts. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 94-52</cite>.

       <p>
        Since the decision as to whether a person serving a sentence of imprisonment should be paroled is an executive function, this section, which vests the judiciary with the right to make such a decision is unconstitutional and void. Commonwealth v. Cornelius, 606 S.W.2d 172, 1980 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 360</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1980).
       </p>

        The power to grant parole is vested exclusively in the executive branch of the government, and thus this section, which authorizes judges to exercise such power, violates Const., §§ 27, 28 and 77 and is void.

        The granting of parole by a county judge (now county/executive) is an executive action presumed to follow the procedure set out in the statute even if the procedure is not mentioned in the parole order.

       A Circuit Court judge cannot parole a misdemeanant serving out a sentence in a county jail as the parole application is properly addressed to the county judge for the county in which he is being held. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 72-548</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1) of this section should be interpreted so that a misdemeanant sentenced by any court other than a police court, in a city of any class could petition the county judge of the county for parole. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 73-53</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although subsection (1) of this section refers to the right of misdemeanants to petition the judge of the sentencing court for parole if they are sentenced by the police court of a city of the first, second or third class, there is nothing said about a misdemeanant sentenced by any court other than a police court in a city of the first three (3) classes and, in order to make the legislation intelligible and completely workable, it should be read to mean that, except where police judges are the sentencing courts in cities of the first three (3) classes, the county judge of the county of imprisonment can parole a misdemeanant convicted by any trial court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 73-108</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the judicial role of the sentencing court is one thing, and parole authority is another, the Circuit Court must exercise jurisdiction and decide on a motion for probation wholly without considering what a county judge may do with a parole petition as the two roles are mutually exclusive and one role does not in any way impinge upon the other. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 73-121</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor in the Circuit Court and the Circuit Judge, upon a hearing, refused probation and the defendant was then paroled by the county judge, this section does not give the county judge appellate jurisdiction as the parole function is not basically of a judicial nature but is an executive or administrative role and the power to grant parole is vested in the county judge of the county wherein the misdemeanant may be confined, except where the misdemeanant is sentenced by a police judge in cities of the first three (3) classes. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 73-121</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section the county judge may parole a misdemeanant if the quarterly court, or Circuit Court, or justice court, in Jefferson County was the sentencing court; also if the police court, as sentencing court in Jefferson County is in a city of the fourth, fifth or sixth class, the county judge may parole a misdemeanant and in such case the detailed parole procedures provided by this section are adequate. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-127</cite>. (Opinion prior to 1976 amendment.)
      </p>
      <p>
       A proposal by the fiscal court permitting a classification committee with the approval of the executive director to suspend service of a misdemeanant sentence should not be adopted by a fiscal court since the granting of parole is an executive function and since such a plan would be an attempt to change the statutory procedure of this section and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.179" target="_self">KRS 439.179</a></cite> contrary to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.083" target="_blank">KRS 67.083</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-132</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Legislature cannot, under the Constitution, confer the executive power of parole upon judges. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-150</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since when a person has been convicted of a crime and has begun to serve his sentence the function and authority of the trial court is finished and what then happens to the prisoner is in the hands of the executive branch of government, this section investing the parole function in the sentencing court is unconstitutional. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-281</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, as last amended in 1982, which permits the sentencing court to grant parole to misdemeanants, is unconstitutional, inoperative, and void. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-618</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The General Assembly could validly enact legislation vesting the authority to parole misdemeanants in the county judge/executives, since they belong to the executive branch of government; such vested authority would have to be accompanied by express or explicit guidelines in order for the county judge/executives to carry out that function. However, there is no effective and constitutional statute vesting such authority in existence at this time; thus at present, the county judge/executives have no authority to parole misdemeanants. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-15</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county judge/executive has no authority to parole misdemeanants, regardless of whether they are convicted in the District or Circuit Court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-352</cite>.

       <p>
        When defendant was charged with escaping from a work release sentence he was granted after a misdemeanor conviction, his argument that he should not have been allowed to participate in work release, due to a “no release” notation on his commitment order, and could not, therefore, be charged with escape, was waived when defendant pled guilty to the escape, and it was improper to ask the appellate court for an interpretation of that statute, especially when it had nothing to do with the felony escape conviction concerning which he was appealing.

       In the event the work release privilege is not expressly granted in the sentence and if the sentencing court was a justice or police court, then the county judge, after the prisoner is received in jail, has the jurisdiction to determine the feasibility of work release upon the prisoner’s petition. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-52</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A proposal by the fiscal court permitting a classification committee with the approval of the executive director to suspend service of a misdemeanant sentence should not be adopted by a fiscal court since the granting of parole is an executive function and since such a plan would be an attempt to change the statutory procedure of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.177" target="_self">KRS 439.177</a></cite> and this section contrary to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.083" target="_blank">KRS 67.083</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-132</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a misdemeanant has been convicted by the Circuit Court and sentenced to jail, the Circuit Judge would no longer have the jurisdiction to grant the incarcerated misdemeanant a work-release privilege. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 77-192</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dieting fees in cases where the prisoner is gainfully employed would, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.150" target="_blank">KRS 64.150</a></cite> (repealed) be paid by the State where the defendants were charged with state statute violations, and the State would be reimbursed by the District Court’s making a proper disbursement of defendant’s earned money, going into the trust account, to the State. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-9</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is good reason to believe that the prisoner, once released, will not come back to jail voluntarily, the sentencing court should be apprised of this in making his determination of the work release. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-564</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since subsection (9) of this section is an exception to the authority of the sentencing court, it would be construed strictly. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-564</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The work release of a prisoner is in the discretion of the sentencing court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-564</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       To detain a prisoner ordered to be released under this section, it must be shown that the prisoner committed a breach of jail discipline or other violation of jail regulations. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-564</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the terms of confinement are changed after the prisoner has begun service of the term, the jailer may release him upon receipt of the court order regardless of who delivers the court order. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-23</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is presumed that the prisoner has been sentenced to ordinary confinement, which means consecutive and continuous confinement. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-23</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a convict has been committed to the jailer’s care, he may be released only upon a lawful discharge, which occurs only where the term of the sentence has expired or where the judgment or court order states that the period of confinement is not to be consecutive and continuous by stating when the jailer is authorized to release the prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-23</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A misdemeanant work release prisoner must pay board of $6.75 per day under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.150" target="_blank">KRS 64.150</a></cite> (repealed), since that dieting fee is in no way affected or amended by this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-103</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the state has already paid the dieting fee under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.150" target="_blank">KRS 64.150</a></cite> (repealed) for a particular period, there is no authority for the state to take the money turned in for the misdemeanant prisoner and to pay the dieting fee money to the jailers in those counties of less than 75,000 population since that would be a duplication of the payment of the dieting fee, which is not authorized by this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-103</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the literal language of subsection (4) of this section, and under the doctrine of in pari materia, the misdemeanant on work release can be charged the per diem board rate for each day he is actually gainfully employed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-313</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a prisoner given a work release walks off the job, or returns to jail in violation of any of the work release conditions or rules or is in violation of any other law, the jailer can detain such prisoner after taking it up with the sentencing court and getting the court’s permission to so detain the prisoner up to five (5) days. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-306</cite>.

        Since this section seemed to have a worthy purpose of providing for a 30 to 60 day observation period to be served before the sentencing court was required to reach a final decision as to the granting of probation, such limited control by the courts over their judgments did not violate Ky.

        Nothing in this section leads one to the rational belief that a prisoner is privileged to negotiate his release by agreeing to an enhanced sentence.

A rule which would allow a prisoner to obtain probation in exchange for a longer sentence in the event of revocation would not only result in chaos, but invite intrusion of arbitrary power.

        The provision of subsection (2) of this section that any court order granting or denying a motion to suspend further execution of a sentence is not reviewable refers to a review on the merits of an order granting or denying a motion for probation and does not deprive the appellate court of its power to determine whether an order was within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court as being within the authority granted by the statute.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The plain and unambiguous language of subsection (1) of this section expresses that the operation of the time limits for filing a motion for shock probation is based on the date when a defendant is delivered into the hands of his jailer, not when he beings to serve the particular sentence for which he was convicted. Terhune v. Commonwealth, 907 S.W.2d 779, 1995 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 177</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in granting defendant's motion for shock probation because the court had lost jurisdiction to grant the motion inasmuch as the operation of the time limit for filing a motion for shock probation was based on the date when defendant was delivered into the hands of his jailer, not when he began to serve the particular sentence for which he was convicted, and defendant's motion was filed 204 days after the statutory time began to run. Commonwealth v. Martin, 2018 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 88</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 23, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        60-day timeframe for considering the motion and the 10-day timeframe for entering an order are, individually, merely a scheduling guideline. The overall 70-day timeframe is the one that decides jurisdiction. Commonwealth v. Reed, 577 S.W.3d 467, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 69</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        On an issue of first impression issue, as long as an order was entered within 70 days after the motion was filed, the order was valid. Since the order in this case was entered within the 70-day time frame, it was valid even though entered 45 days after the hearing on the motion. Commonwealth v. Reed, 577 S.W.3d 467, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 69</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislature has chosen not to deny a defendant consideration of shock probation on a second or subsequent sentence, and the plain and unambiguous language of subsection (1) of this section refers to the 30-to-180-day time period following a defendant’s conviction and sentencing, placing no qualifications on whether that sentence was a subsequent sentence.

       <p>
        The decision of whether to grant shock probation to a defendant who has already served a portion of a previous sentence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. Terhune v. Commonwealth, 907 S.W.2d 779, 1995 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 177</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1995).

        Because defendant did not file a motion for shock probation pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.265" target="_self">KRS 439.265</a></cite>, and indeed could not as part of defendant’s plea agreement, and because, pursuant to RCr 8.10, the circuit court could not accept the plea and then circumvent its terms by its own actions, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to order a hearing or consider shock probation; therefore, a writ of prohibition was appropriate. Hidalgo v. Commonwealth, 290 S.W.3d 56, 2009 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 143</cite> (Ky. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in granting defendant's motion for shock probation because it lacked jurisdiction to enter the order where it did not strictly comply with the statutory time limitations, the order was entered more than 320 days after the filing of the original motion, an order seeking information, although within the 10-day time period, did not toll the time for entry of a ruling where it was clearly not a ruling on the motion for shock probation, it did not grant or deny the motion, but merely ordered information to assist the court in making its decision. Commonwealth v. Settles, 488 S.W.3d 626, 2016 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 60</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commonwealth’s argument that appellee was not entitled to shock probation because he was convicted of reckless homicide could not be reviewed where the circuit court had not deemed appellee’s act to be violent so as to prohibit shock probation, that was a decision on the merits, and thus, reviewing that decision was prohibited by
    Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.265" target="_self">439.265(</a></cite>2). However, the argument that the court was without jurisdiction to grant shock probation because the order was entered more than 10 days after the shock probation hearing was reviewable as it concerned jurisdiction.

       The General Assembly in this section intended for shock probation to be available only to those convicted felons who have served at least 30 days in a state prison and not a county jail; this opinion is supported by the theory behind this section that some convicts who have committed serious crimes (usually young first offenders), after confinement in a state prison for 30 days, will be so shocked by the confinement in the prison at hard labor that they will not get into trouble again. However, if a Circuit Court placed a convicted felon in the county jail, it would clearly be within the Circuit Court’s power to subsequently probate that convicted felon within 10 days. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-146</cite>.

        In revoking defendant’s probation, the trial court appropriately considered the Kentucky General Assembly’s wishes espoused in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3106" target="_self">KRS 439.3106</a></cite>, which became effective the same day as <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.551" target="_self">KRS 439.551</a></cite>; the court stated that, due to defendant’s failure to comply with the conditions of probation during the first few hours of probation, and due to the violent nature of the crimes committed, revocation of probation was the appropriate sanction for the probation violation. Jarrell v. Commonwealth, 384 S.W.3d 195, 2012 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 233</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Revocation of defendant’s probation was inappropriate because the trial court erred in failing to evaluate the other statutory criteria set forth in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3106" target="_self">KRS 439.3106</a></cite> and in relying solely on the element of failure to report; further, defendant’s new alleged criminal behavior was not violent. The trial court’s conviction that reporting was the most important condition of probation was unsupported by the law. Carter v. Commonwealth, 2013 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 41</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2013), review denied, ordered not published, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 22</cite> (Ky. Feb. 11, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a probation revocation case, a trial court did not commit palpable error by failing to consider graduated sanctions under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3106" target="_self">KRS 439.3106</a></cite> where testimonial evidence showed that appellant had been a cocaine addict for 20 years, he had been through 4 treatment programs, and he had exhausted the treatment options; even though appellant contended that the Commonwealth failed to show that he was a threat to the community, § 439.3106 did not require the trial court to make specific findings of fact. <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3107" target="_self">KRS 439.3107</a></cite> did not apply to this case, and palpable error review was necessary because claim under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3106" target="_self">KRS 439.3106</a></cite> was not preserved for review on appeal. Kaletch v. Commonwealth, 396 S.W.3d 324, 2013 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 49</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of the statute lends itself to only one conclusion, both the trial court and the Department of Corrections' (DOC) officers must assess a probationer's conduct in light of the statute and proceed in accordance with the statute; the location of the statute in the “Probation and Parole” chapter in no way limits its application to the DOC. Commonwealth v. Andrews, 448 S.W.3d 773, 2014 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 607</cite> (Ky. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        By requiring trial courts to determine that a probationer is a danger to prior victims or the community at large and that he/she cannot be appropriately managed in the community before revoking probation, the legislature furthers the objectives of the graduated sanctions schema to ensure that probationers are not being incarcerated for minor probation violations. Commonwealth v. Andrews, 448 S.W.3d 773, 2014 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 607</cite> (Ky. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Application of the statute allows the trial court to conclude with some certainty that the imposition of some other accountability measure would be fruitless, as the probationer both poses a risk and is not manageable in the community; the statute requires trial courts to consider whether a probationer's failure to abide by a condition of supervision constitutes a significant risk to prior victims or the community and whether the probationer cannot be managed in the community before revocation. Commonwealth v. Andrews, 448 S.W.3d 773, 2014 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 607</cite> (Ky. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court acted within its discretion in revoking defendant's probation because it plainly considered a variety of factors, and specifically considered the criteria in the statute; While the Public Safety and Offender Accountability Act, reflects a new emphasis in imposing and managing probation, it does not upend the trial court's discretion in matters of probation revocation, provided that discretion is exercised consistent with statutory criteria. Commonwealth v. Andrews, 448 S.W.3d 773, 2014 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 607</cite> (Ky. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court on remand was to conduct a hearing to determine if defendant was a danger to prior victims or the community at large and could not be appropriately managed in the community before revoking conditional discharge because the court's order of revocation of conditional discharge was silent as to the imposition of graduated sanctions. Williams v. Commonwealth, 462 S.W.3d 407, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 61</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's decision revoking probation was reversed where the record did not indicate whether any measures other than incarceration were considered, the trial court failed to consider whether the probationer's use of drugs and failure to report a change of address made him a significant risk to the community and that he could not be managed in the community, and thus, the trial court had not properly applied
    Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 439.3106.
    Poston v. Commonwealth, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 70</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. May 22, 2015), review denied, ordered not published, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 2070</cite> (Ky. Dec. 10, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court abused its discretion in revoking defendant's pretrial diversion and sentencing him to two years' imprisonment in accordance with his original sentence, even though there was a zero-tolerance provision and he admitted to violating the conditions of his diversion, because there was no evidence in the record that defendant was a danger to a prior victim or to the community and he could not be appropriately managed in the community as required by this section and 501 Ky. Admin. Regs. 6:250. The evidence showed that the diverted charge was defendant's first offense, the record was devoid of any evidence that he would not benefit from drug treatment, and his probation officer confirmed that he was cooperative. Helms v. Commonwealth, 475 S.W.3d 637, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 83</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Zero-tolerance provisions in diversion agreements are barred but do so only because such a holding would admittedly render our opinion subject to attack under the separation of powers doctrine. However, a judge's commitment to a predetermined outcome upon a violation of a condition of diversion without consideration of this section is an abuse of discretion. Helms v. Commonwealth, 475 S.W.3d 637, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 83</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in voiding defendant's pretrial diversion and sentencing him to two years in prison because it incorrectly concluded that the criteria for the revocation of probation was inapplicable to the voidance of diversion; by operation of the unambiguous language of Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc533s533.256" target="_blank">533.256(</a></cite>2), the new criteria for the revocation of probation set out in § 439.3106 also applies to the voidance of diversion. Richardson v. Commonwealth, 494 S.W.3d 495, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 118</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015) sub. nom.Commonwealth v. Cunningham, 2016 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 355</cite> (Ky. Aug. 17, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court properly revoked defendant’s probation because the child support statute did not require the court to impose a lesser sanction where there was no dispute that defendant failed to make his required child support payments for 10 years, for which the circuit court found that defendant offered no credible explanation, both the child and the Commonwealth were victims of defendant’s failure to provide, probation had been imposed more than 12 years prior, was extended on at least two occasions, defendant promised at every opportunity to have “a plan” to make payments, but failed to make payments, failed to maintain employment, and failed to maintain a current address with the child support office. Embry v. Commonwealth, 561 S.W.3d 360, 2018 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 122</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant’s probation and sentencing him to his remaining three-year term as the Commonwealth’s evidence was more than sufficient to support revocation of probation because defendant admitted to using controlled substances while under supervision; even if a single positive drug test was insufficient to warrant revocation, defendant expressly refused to enroll in a long-term drug treatment program as directed by the court; his payment of restitution had been inconsistent even since his most-recent release; and he absconded from supervision for nearly seven years. Hall v. Commonwealth, 566 S.W.3d 578, 2018 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 294</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in revoking defendant’s probation because, while application of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine would deprive defendant of her constitutional right to seek redress on appeal, defendant offered nothing to contradict the testimony that, at a minimum, she failed to respond/report to her Ohio probation officer as directed, and the trial court erred by stating that the statute at issue need not be considered by trial courts when revocation proceedings stemmed from absconding supervision inasmuch as there was no such exception. Hess v. Commonwealth, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 12</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Feb. 1, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in setting aside defendant’s felony diversion because it failed to consider either Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc533s533.256" target="_blank">533.256 </a></cite>or Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 439.3106 in determining whether to void defendant’s pretrial diversion; as the trial court apparently did not contemplate either statute prior to its decision, the matter was remanded for consideration of those statutes should the Commonwealth continue to seek voidance of defendant’s pretrial diversion. Moreial Lamaur Zanders v. Commonwealth, 572 S.W.3d 76, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 27</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant pleaded guilty to felony flagrant non-support and then repeatedly failed to make payments and to abide by the orders of the trial court and conditions of her conditional discharge, the circuit court palpably erred in revoking defendant’s conditional discharge because it failed to consider whether her violations were a significant risk to her prior victim or the community at large, and whether she could be appropriately managed in the community. Fazzari v. Commonwealth, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 70</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly revoked defendant’s probation because incarceration was a possibility where the statute at issue permitted, but did not require, the court to employ lesser sanctions, the facts were stipulated—the only issue was what sanction would be imposed—and defendant did not seek to present additional testimonial or documentary evidence, and the record supported the trial court’s decision inasmuch as, while on probation, defendant repeatedly used drugs and submitted falsified paperwork to the drug court. New v. Commonwealth, 598 S.W.3d 88, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 134</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s failure to pay restitution should not have been considered by the trial court when determining whether defendant’s pretrial diversion should have been revoked because the restitution order failed to specify when defendant should make payments, how frequently, in what amount, and to whom and there could be no willful failure to comply given such deficiencies. Compise v. Commonwealth, 597 S.W.3d 175, 2020 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 26</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2020).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not commit palpable error by revoking defendant's diversion because her felony pretrial diversion agreement clearly authorized it to revoke or modify any condition in the agreement during the diversion period, it was not statutorily required to make specific findings of fact, and it went through the history of the case, defendant's numerous violations of the conditions, and the various chances she received to comply with the conditions. Stilgenbauer v. Commonwealth, 2014 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 1039 (Ky. Ct. App. Sept. 26, 2014), review denied, ordered not published, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1663</cite> (Ky. June 3, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In revoking defendant's probation, the trial court did not articulate that it had considered
    Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 439.3106. The plain language of the statute lent itself to only one conclusion—both the trial court and the Department of Corrections' officers were required to assess defendant's conduct in light of § 439.3106 and proceed in accordance with the statute.
    Brann v. Commonwealth, 469 S.W.3d 429, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 122</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court must consider when revoking probation whether a probationer is a danger to his or her victim or the community at large and whether a probationer cannot be appropriately managed in the community; the trial court in this case never addressed such, the trial court's offhanded statements did not reach the level statutorily required, and the written order entered in this case did not reference the statute or its elements. Blankenship v. Commonwealth, 494 S.W.3d 506, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 178</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial courts must consider and make findings, oral or written, comporting with the statute. Blankenship v. Commonwealth, 494 S.W.3d 506, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 178</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 439.3106 makes no distinction between probation or parole, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky finds as a matter of law that the requirements of § 439.3106 must apply to the Kentucky State Parole Board as well as to the courts. The Board's failure to make express findings on the record, oral or otherwise, demonstrating that the Board considered the requirements of § 439.3106, before their final revocation of an inmate's parole, is a fatal flaw. Murrell v. Ky. Parole Bd., 531 S.W.3d 503, 2017 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 618</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court's failure to make the required statutory findings required constituted palpable error; although the circuit court made a finding that defendant could not be managed in the community, it did not make a finding that he was a significant risk to the community, and both findings were required, and the circuit court also did not make the required findings under other case law, and remand was required. Burnett v. Commonwealth, 538 S.W.3d 322, 2017 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 657</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court erred in voiding defendant's pretrial diversion and imposing her three-year sentence for flagrant nonsupport because, although the court did make a finding that defendant could not be effectively managed in the community, it failed to make any findings as to whether defendant posed a danger to her prior victims or to the community, and there was a “substantial possibility” that the result of defendant's voidance hearing would have been different without the alleged error. Lainhart v. Commonwealth, 534 S.W.3d 234, 2017 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 689</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Circuit court order voiding defendant's diversion agreement was remanded where although it made a finding that defendant could not be managed in the community, it had not made a finding that he was a significant risk to the community as required by Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 439.3106(1). Price v. Commonwealth, 534 S.W.3d 805, 2017 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 685</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court was not required to make written findings when probation was revoked in a case because the probationer agreed to the revocation of his probation without a hearing as part of an agreement to dismiss the new charges that were filed against the probationer. Howard v. Commonwealth, 2018 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 102</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 16, 2018, sub. op., 2018 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 781 (Ky. Ct. App. Mar. 16, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in revoking defendant’s conditional discharge because its written order made no mention of the statute or its criteria, and the trial court’s failure to assess defendant’s conduct in light of the statute constituted palpable error.
    Fazzari v. Commonwealth, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 70</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial courts, in determining whether to revoke an individual’s conditional discharge, must consider and issue specific findings as to whether the individual’s failure to comply with terms of his or her conditional discharge constitute a significant risk to his or her prior victims or the community at large, and cannot be appropriately managed in the community.
    Fazzari v. Commonwealth, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 70</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court failed to make the mandatory findings pursuant to this section prior to revoking defendant’s probation, and therefore the revocation was vacated, because the only mention of the statutory criteria could be found in the written orders that were preprinted forms that the trial court completed in writing, and the trial court did not include any other findings, other than the conclusory statements on the preprinted forms, related to the statutory criteria. Walker v. Commonwealth, 588 S.W.3d 453, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 146</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court of appeals erred in reversing and remanding the trial court’s order revoking defendant’s probation because the trial court specifically considered when it made oral and written findings; the trial court’s oral findings explained the reasons defendant’s probation was revoked, and in its written order, the trial court spelled out the required language under subsection (1). Commonwealth v. Gilmore, 587 S.W.3d 627, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 432</cite> (Ky. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court looks to both the written and oral findings in conjunction with one another and not separately in a vacuum; therefore, it must look at the trial court’s findings, both in open court and in its written order, to determine whether subsection (1) and due process requirements were met. Commonwealth v. Gilmore, 587 S.W.3d 627, 2019 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 432</cite> (Ky. 2019).

       The department shall, by January 1, 2012, adopt a system of graduated sanctions for violations of conditions of community supervision. Notwithstanding KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc533" target="_blank">Chapter 533</a></cite>, the system shall set forth a menu of presumptive sanctions for the most common types of supervision violations, including but not limited to: failure to report; failure to pay fines, fees, and victim restitution; failure to participate in a required program or service; failure to complete community service; violation of a protective or no contact order; and failure to refrain from the use of alcohol or controlled substances. The system of sanctions shall take into account factors such as the severity of the current violation, the supervised individual’s previous criminal record, the number and severity of any previous supervision violations, the supervised individual’s assessed risk level, and the extent to which graduated sanctions were imposed for previous violations. The system also shall define positive reinforcements that supervised individuals may receive for compliance with conditions of supervision.

        In a probation revocation case, a trial court did not commit palpable error by failing to consider graduated sanctions under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3106" target="_self">KRS 439.3106</a></cite> where testimonial evidence showed that appellant had been a cocaine addict for 20 years, he had been through 4 treatment programs, and he had exhausted the treatment options; even though appellant contended that the Commonwealth failed to show that he was a threat to the community, § 439.3106 did not require the trial court to make specific findings of fact. <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3107" target="_self">KRS 439.3107</a></cite> did not apply to this case, and palpable error review was necessary because claim under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3106" target="_self">KRS 439.3106</a></cite> was not preserved for review on appeal.

        Trial court on remand was to conduct a hearing to determine if defendant was a danger to prior victims or the community at large and could not be appropriately managed in the community before revoking conditional discharge because the court's order of revocation of conditional discharge was silent as to the imposition of graduated sanctions.

       Acts 1986, ch. 92, § 2, which became effective July 15, 1986, provided that, “The General Assembly confirms the reorganization of the Parole Board by Executive Order 85-795 issued on October 10, 1985, to the extent that it is not otherwise confirmed by this Act.” Such Executive Order expanded membership of the parole board. Since the board had a current backlog, two new members were appointed by the governor for four (4) year terms. No more than four (4) members of the new seven (7) member board were to be of one political party, and four (4) members constituted a quorum. The governor was to name a chairperson and two vice-chairpersons from among the seven (7) members. If the position of executive director became open the responsibilities of the position would be assumed by the chairperson of the board.

      </p>
      <p>
       Since three (3) members of the Parole Board constitute a quorum concerning parole hearings under this section, any hearing conducted under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.340ol12" target="_self">KRS 439.340(2)</a></cite> by three (3) or more members of the Parole Board would be a public meeting of a public body and open to the public. Two (2) members of the Parole Board do not constitute a quorum and thus prior to the 1992 amendments to the Open Meetings Act such a hearing would not be a public meeting of a public agency. However, the Open Meetings Act as amended in 1992, in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.810ol12" target="_blank">KRS 61.810(2)</a></cite>, deals with “less than quorum meetings.” <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.810ol12" target="_blank">KRS 61.810(2)</a></cite> would prohibit the Parole Board from adopting a procedure whereby it utilizes two (2) person panels to conduct hearings and to prohibit public accessibility when panels of three (3) or more Parole Board members conducting the same kinds of hearings would be clearly open meetings open to the public. Thus, if the Parole Board utilizes two (2) person panels to conduct the hearings required by <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.340ol12" target="_self">KRS 439.340(2)</a></cite> such hearings are open to the public. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-146</cite>.

        Right of review of action taken by parole board is limited to questions of compliance with the parole act. Willard v. Ferguson, 358 S.W.2d 516, 1962 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 186</cite> (Ky. 1962).

        Where parole board denied parole and ordered that no further applications be made within 48 months, court may not enjoin enforcement of that order without a showing of noncompliance by the board with the parole act. Willard v. Ferguson, 358 S.W.2d 516, 1962 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 186</cite> (Ky. 1962).

       Although the psychiatric and psychological evaluations found in an inmate’s parole review file are confidential, caution should be exercised upon any examination thereof; the Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee and its staff may have access to the files, but should protect against the general release or publication of the material. Public discussion of this review should scrupulously avoid identification of individual inmates and the opinions expressed in the evaluations with respect to each of them. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-86</cite>.

       The board may release on parole persons confined in any adult state penal or correctional institution of Kentucky or sentenced felons incarcerated in county jails eligible for parole. All paroles shall issue upon order of the board duly adopted. As soon as practicable after his or her admission to an adult state penal or correctional institution or county jail if he or she is a sentenced felon, and at such intervals thereafter as it may determine, the Department of Corrections shall obtain all pertinent information regarding each prisoner, except those not eligible for parole. The information shall include the results of his or her most recent risk and needs assessment, his or her criminal record, his or her conduct, employment, and the reports of physical and mental examinations that have been made. The Department of Corrections shall furnish the circumstances of his or her offense, the results of his or her most recent risk and needs assessment, and his or her previous social history to the board. The Department of Corrections shall prepare a report on any information it obtains. It shall be the duty of the Department of Corrections to supplement this report with any material the board may request and submit the report to the board.

       Before granting the parole of any prisoner, the board shall consider the pertinent information regarding the prisoner, including the results of his or her most recent risk and needs assessment, and shall have him or her appear before it for interview and hearing. The board in its discretion may hold interviews and hearings for prisoners convicted of Class C felonies not included within the definition of “violent offender” in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3401" target="_self">KRS 439.3401</a></cite> and Class D felonies not included within the definition of “sex crime” in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.03.html#tIIIc17s17.500" target="_blank">KRS 17.500</a></cite>.

A parole shall be ordered only for the best interest of society and not as an award of clemency, and it shall not be considered a reduction of sentence or pardon. A prisoner shall be placed on parole only when arrangements have been made for his or her proper employment or for his or her maintenance and care, and when the board believes he or she is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law abiding citizen. Notwithstanding any statute to the contrary, including <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.330" target="_self">KRS 440.330</a></cite>, when a prisoner is otherwise eligible for parole and the board has recommended parole for that prisoner for the reasons set forth in this subsection, the board may grant parole to any prisoner wanted as a fugitive by any other jurisdiction, and the prisoner shall be released to the detainer from that jurisdiction. Such parole shall not constitute a relinquishment of jurisdiction over the prisoner, and the board in all cases expressly reserves the right to return the prisoner to confinement in a correctional institution of the Commonwealth if the prisoner violates the terms of his or her parole.

        Where a federal court decided the governor had powers of commutation as well as of pardon, since the commuted sentence of life imprisonment without parole was less than that of the death penalty which had been affirmed by the courts of Kentucky, defendant was collaterally estopped from relitigating this question.

        A defendant who was indicted on two (2) counts of first-degree robbery and for being a persistent felony offender, but as to whom one robbery count and the persistent felon count were dismissed as part of a plea bargain, was not entitled to have the dismissed charges segregated from the presentence investigation report in the hands of the Parole Board.

        5.Criteria for Determining Release.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although this section vests broad discretion in the Kentucky State Parole Board, it does not employ language requiring release absent a finding that release would be inappropriate for a specified reason, but instead, this section prohibits parole absent a determination that such would be in the best interest of society; in construing the language of this section the appellate court concluded that this statute does not elevate parole to a liberty interest in which inmates have a legitimate claim of entitlement nor does it mean that the full panoply of due process required to convict and confine must be employed by the board in deciding to deny parole and continue confinement. Belcher v. Kentucky Parole Bd., 917 S.W.2d 584, 1996 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 48</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).

        The application of subsection (11) to the appellant, who was thereby required to complete a sex offender treatment program before he became eligible for parole, was not inappropriate where (1) the appellant was sentenced to five (5) years’ imprisonment and would normally have been eligible for parole after one (1) year, and (2) the sex offender treatment program was a three (3) year program.

       Pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.175" target="_self">KRS 439.175</a></cite> (repealed) and departmental regulations a county judge may parole a misdemeanant without regard to any precise minimum to be served. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 64-353</cite>.

       <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc532s532.120" target="_blank">KRS 532.120</a></cite> must be read in para materia with this section and, although that section requires that all jail time be credited for all purposes as time served in prison, the parole board may by regulation require that a specified time actually be served by the prisoner in the institution to which he was sentenced before he is eligible for parole consideration. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-399</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.352" target="_self">KRS 439.352</a></cite>, a parolee is automatically recommitted to prison if he has received a new sentence for the commission of a crime while on parole. Even though an appeal is granted and an appeal bond set, the parolee can be legally held by the state parole authorities because he is still in their custody by virtue of his sentence from which he was originally paroled. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-267</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the psychiatric and psychological evaluations found in an inmate’s parole review file are confidential, caution should be exercised upon any examination thereof; the Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee and its staff may have access to the files, but should protect against the general release or publication of the material. Public discussion of this review should scrupulously avoid identification of individual inmates and the opinions expressed in the evaluations with respect to each of them. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-86</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chairman of the Parole Board has no unilateral authority to open or close any portion of a parole release hearing. Hearings may only be closed when there is specific statutory authorization, such as subsection (7) (now (8)) of this section and the terms of the section are expressly satisfied. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-146</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interview and discussion portion of a parole release hearing with the prisoner are meetings open to the public, but the deliberations for decisions of the parole board may be conducted in closed sessions. The hearings conducted pursuant to subsection (5) of this section may be closed pursuant to a closure request by the persons having a right to appear at such hearings for reasons of personal security. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-146</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since three (3) members of the Parole Board constitute a quorum concerning parole hearings (KRS 439.320(4)), any hearing conducted under subsection (2) of this section by three (3) or more members of the Parole Board would be a public meeting of a public body and open to the public. Two (2) members of the Parole Board do not constitute a quorum and thus prior to the 1992 amendments to the Open Meetings Act such a hearing would not be a public meeting of a public agency. However, the Open Meetings Act as amended in 1992, in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.810ol12" target="_blank">KRS 61.810(2)</a></cite>, deals with “less than quorum meetings.” <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.810ol12" target="_blank">KRS 61.810(2)</a></cite> would prohibit the Parole Board from adopting a procedure whereby it utilizes two (2) person panels to conduct hearings and to prohibit public accessibility when panels of three (3) or more Parole Board members conducting the same kinds of hearings would be clearly open meetings open to the public. Thus, if the Parole Board utilizes two (2) person panels to conduct the hearings required by subsection (2) of this section, such hearings are open to the public. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-146</cite>.

       <p>
        A juvenile offender’s sentence of life without the possibility of parole for twenty-five (25) years was permissible under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.51.html#tLIc640s640.040ol13" target="_blank">KRS 640.040(3)</a></cite> because the limitations on probation and parole were imposed by the sentence and not as a function of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc533s533.060" target="_blank">KRS 533.060</a></cite> or <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3401" target="_self">KRS 439.3401</a></cite>; therefore, at the juvenile offender’s 18-year-old hearing, the trial court did not have the option of ordering probation or conditional discharge, nor did it have the ability to return him to juvenile custody to complete a treatment program. By virtue of the sentence itself, the trial court’s only option was to transfer the offender to adult custody. Commonwealth v. Carneal, 274 S.W.3d 420, 2008 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Trial court erred by sentencing defendant, a youthful offender, without first considering probation or another form of conditional discharge as a sentencing option because Kentucky’s Juvenile Code and the court’s holdings in Merriman, Buckner, and Edwards support the conclusion that the violent offender statute was not applicable to youthful offenders for purposes of consideration of probation, even if they were sentenced after they reached 18 years and five months.

        Inmate was entitled to relief because trial counsel’s gross misadvice or nonadvice concerning parole eligibility may have amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel worthy of postconviction relief. All parties operated under the misapprehension that the inmate was not subject to violent offender status because the plea offer recommended probation and his sentence was probated, in violation of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.3401ol13" target="_self">KRS 439.3401(3)</a></cite>.

        Defendant, who sought relief from his guilty plea, stated a Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the merits of his claim. The misadvice allegedly given defendant—that he would become eligible for parole in six years whereas in fact as a violent offender he would not become eligible for twenty years required that defendant be granted the opportunity to prove his allegations of misadvice and prejudice, if any, at an evidentiary hearing.

        Defendant convicted of robbery in the first degree qualifies as a violent offender pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat.

        In order to avoid the denial of equal protection and failure of due process which would otherwise result from a literal interpretation of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, the Supreme Court concluded that it was the intention of the legislature, in determining minimum parole eligibility of those violent offenders who committed offenses after July 15, 1986, to require service of 50% of a term of years or 12 years, whichever is less, before parole eligibility.

        Trial court did not deny defendant his right to due process when it found that defendant was a violent offender and that the victim suffered serious physical injury; here, there was sufficient evidence to show that defendant inflicted wounds which subjected the victim to substantial risk of death and caused disfigurement.

        Defendant was not entitled to relief from defendant’s guilty plea on grounds that defendant was unaware that defendant would be sentenced as a persistent felony offender (PFO) because (1) defendant’s signed and acknowledged plea agreement said the Commonwealth would recommend a ten-year sentence enhanced to 20 years by defendant’s PFO indictment, which defendant received, and (2) defendant’s RCr P. 11.42 motion said defendant was advised that if defendant pled guilty defendant would receive a 20-year sentence and be eligible for parole after four years, so defendant was not misinformed about defendant’s PFO-enhanced sentence.

        Where defendant killed his sister’s abusive boyfriend, substantial evidence supported a conclusion that there was a connection between the domestic violence and the offense charged for purposes of the domestic violence exception to the violent offender statute under subsection (5) because the evidence established that the boyfriend’s acts of violence against defendant’s sister made defendant fearful of the boyfriend, that the boyfriend had violently assaulted defendant’s sister earlier that day, that defendant and other family members were at her apartment to repair a telephone damaged in the altercation, that the boyfriend — who was much larger than defendant — returned to the apartment and caused fear in all present, and that the boyfriend advanced menacingly toward defendant before defendant shot him.

        When defense counsel advised defendant that, if defendant pled guilty, defendant would receive a 20-year sentence and be eligible for parole after four years, this was deficient performance under the Strickland test because (1) the parole eligibility consequences imposed by the violent offender statute were sufficiently penalty-like, severe, and enmeshed with a sentence to be deemed like deportation, and (2) the statute was clear and explicit so that the consequences could be easily determined by simply reading the statute.

        Defendant was not entitled to relief when defense counsel incorrectly advised defendant that, if defendant pled guilty, defendant would receive a 20-year sentence and be eligible for parole after four years, when defendant was not eligible for parole for 17 years, because defendant did not show the incorrect advice resulted in prejudice, as defendant alleged no facts showing that it would have been rational, absent the error, for defendant to reject a plea bargain and go to trial, as defendant alleged no defenses to three of the five robberies defendant was charged with and defendant was at least a second-degree persistent felony offender, subjecting defendant to a minimum 20-year sentence and, very possibly, a much greater sentence.

      <p>
       The deletion of Section 2 of House Bill 7, which requires that the amendment contained in Section 1 of the Bill apply only to criminal offenses committed after the effective date of the Bill, will not effect the application of the proposed revision of this section because of the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws and because of the requirement of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.41.html#tXLIc446s446.080ol13" target="_blank">KRS 446.080(3)</a></cite> that retrospective bills contain an express statement of retroactivity. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-26</cite>.

       Shock probation for persons convicted of a DUI vehicular homicide does not constitute an exercise of absolute and arbitrary power in violation of the Kentucky Constitution, although it is questionable as public policy. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 11-005</cite>,

        Had the General Assembly disagreed with the Department of Corrections’

        Where on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus the prisoner contended that he had completed his sentences by combination of time served in the reformatory and time on parole when “good time” was computed, the prisoner could not show that he had sufficient “good time” because of his violation of parole evidenced by his subsequent convictions.

       </p>
       <p>
        It was proper to use defendant’s prior conviction in convicting him as a first-degree persistent felon, although according to a schedule of “good time” awarded each prisoner, his sentence would have resulted in a minimum expiration date more than five (5) years prior to commission of the latest crime, if completely served, where he violated the provisions of his parole for the prior conviction, was returned to prison, was paroled for a second time and received his final discharge from parole less than five (5) years prior to the latest offense.

        Time served by a prisoner in a federal prison while technically on parole from the state penitentiary should not be considered as creditable parole time. Kirkman v. Jones, 346 S.W.2d 776, 1961 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 339</cite> (Ky. 1961) (decided under prior law).

        Where prisoner serving three (3) ten (10) year sentences for Kentucky armed robbery concurrently with Indiana sentence was paroled after three (3) years served in Indiana prison, Kentucky officials were without authority to arrest and incarcerate him, since Indiana law allows parole time to be counted as time in custody, despite contrary provisions of this section, unless the prisoner had served the maximum Indiana sentence. Brock v. Sowders, 610 S.W.2d 591, 1980 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 279</cite> (Ky. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because Indiana has since revised its parole statutes and a person does not earn credit time while on parole or probation, defendant was not allowed additional credit against his Kentucky sentence for one (1) year spent on Indiana parole while simultaneously incarcerated in Kentucky; defendant was entitled to seven (7) years of credit time on his Kentucky sentence for his time incarcerated in Indiana, but no more.

        Inmate was not entitled to a sentence credit for the time the inmate spent on parole, and which was spent serving time in a Missouri prison, as parole time was not counted as part of a prisoner’s maximum sentence except in determining the parolee’s eligibility for a final discharge from parole, which was a situation that did not involve the inmate.

        Inmate was not entitled to credit against his Kentucky sentences for time served in Ohio pursuant to Ohio sentences, either before or after his parole in Kentucky was revoked. O'Conner v.

        Because 2003 Ky. Acts, ch. 156, pt.

        Where a parolee was returned to prison for a new conviction and not because he violated a technical condition of his parole, there is no need for a preliminary hearing because the subsequent criminal conviction conclusively establishes the parole violation.

       If a parolee commits a crime and is convicted, his parole shall be revoked even though an appeal is granted and an appeal bond set and the parolee can be legally held by the state parole authorities because he is still in their custody by virtue of the sentence from which he was originally paroled. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 72-109</cite>.

      <p>
       Under this section, a parolee is automatically recommitted to prison if he has received a new sentence for the commission of a crime while on parole. Even though an appeal is granted and an appeal bond set, the parolee can be legally held by the state parole authorities because he is still in their custody by virtue of his sentence from which he was originally paroled. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-267</cite>.
      </p>

       Where the sole ground for the parole revocation was a recommitment offense that is subsequently reversed, reasonable grounds for the revocation cease to exist, and the prisoner should be reparoled to avoid potential due process problems. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-267</cite>.

        Where on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus the prisoner contended that he had completed his sentences by combination of time served in the reformatory and time on parole when “good time” was computed, the prisoner could not show that he had sufficient “good time” because of his violations of parole evidenced by his subsequent convictions.

        It was proper to use defendant’s prior conviction in convicting him as a first-degree persistent felon, although according to a schedule of “good time” awarded each prisoner, his sentence would have resulted in a minimum expiration date more than five (5) years prior to commission of the latest crime, if completely served, where he violated the provisions of his parole for the prior conviction, was returned to prison, was paroled for a second time and received his final discharge from parole less than five (5) years prior to the latest offense.

        The District Court did not err in counting the 1970 convictions against defendant for purposes of sentencing him under the Armed Career Criminal Act even though in 1970 the laws of Kentucky did not criminalize possession of a firearm by a felon and the Kentucky Constitution guaranteed citizens the right to bear arms. Kentucky does not restore civil rights to convicted felons by statute. Kentucky provides that a prisoner’s civil rights may be restored by “an act of the governor.” Even if defendant may have been able to possess a firearm for some period of time following his 1970 convictions, such would not act as a restoration of civil rights within the meaning of 18 USCS § 92(a)(20).

The written statement delivered with the parolee or offender on postincarceration supervision by the arresting officer to the official in charge of the station house, jail, workhouse, or other place of detention, shall be sufficient warrant for the detention of the parolee or offender on postincarceration supervision.

Thereupon, if the commissioner or his or her designee believes the parolee or offender on postincarceration supervision should be returned to prison, the commissioner or his or her designee at once shall submit his or her recommendations to the board, and, if the board approves, it shall issue a warrant upon which the releasee shall be returned to prison; otherwise the prisoner shall be released upon the order of the commissioner or his or her designee.

        Where accused was convicted and sentenced in 1954 and was paroled in April 1965 and reimprisoned in May 1967 for violating parole, his arrest as a parole violator without warrant was governed by this section enacted in 1956 and not by <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.190" target="_self">KRS 439.190</a></cite> which was repealed simultaneously. Morris v. Wingo, 421 F.2d 651, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 10985 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1970</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        The application of this section to a person convicted prior to its enactment does not violate the constitutional prohibition against enactment of ex post facto laws. Morris v. Wingo, 428 S.W.2d 765, 1968 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 724</cite> (Ky. 1968).

        Where parolee was convicted prior to enactment of this section but paroled after its enactment, this section and not the law as it existed at the time of conviction was applicable in case of revocation of parole.

       <p>
        The intent of subsection (3), classifying fugitive parole violators as fugitives from justice, is merely to exclude the period that such a person is a fugitive from credit towards time remaining to be served on his sentence, and such classification could not be used to satisfy the separate prior felony requirement of the federal dangerous special offender statute, 18 USCS § 3575 (e).

        If the welfare department in rearresting a parolee abuses its authority the remedy of the parolee to secure his release is not by writ of habeas corpus but by a proceeding in the Circuit Court in the proper county to obtain a writ of mandamus requiring the department to proceed properly. Mahan v. Buchanan, 310 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 832</cite>, 221 S.W.2d 945, 1949 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 1015</cite> (Ky. 1949) (decided under prior law).

       <p>
        Parole officer was entitled to qualified official immunity in a wrongful death action arising from an car accident caused by a parolee who was fleeing from police, because the parole officer properly exercised his discretionary duties under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.480" target="_self">KRS 439.480</a></cite> in supervising the parolee; the record showed that upon learning of the parolee’s failure to report, the parole officer promptly initiated a home visit and left a note directing the parolee to report to his office. The parole officer also submitted a supervision report to the parole board requesting a parole violation warrant under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.430" target="_self">KRS 439.430</a></cite>; he was not required to arrest the parolee.

        Although parole officer failed to deputize by written statement the police officers making arrest of alleged parole violator, but had with him the parole violation warrant, parolee was not entitled to issuance of mandamus to compel parole board to release him, nor was that technical defect grounds for vacating original judgment of conviction. Evans v. Thomas, 372 S.W.2d 798, 1963 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 148</cite> (Ky. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 934, 84 S. Ct. 705, 11 L. Ed. 2d 653, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 1760 (U.S. 1964).

        A paroled convict is in the control of the board of prison commissioners and may be arrested on a warrant and placed again in prison for a violation of his parole, and when so placed again in prison cannot be released on a writ of habeas corpus, as his imprisonment is not without authority of law. Board of Prison Comm'rs v. Crumbaugh, 161 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 540</cite>, 170 S.W. 1187, 1914 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 99</cite> (Ky. 1914) (decided under prior law).

        Prisoner who was transferred against his will to another prison beyond the jurisdiction of this state, apparently to serve the remainder of his term, and was there restrained after he had served time which would have made him eligible for parole under Kentucky law, was entitled to release upon his return to this state.

        The parolee did not have a constitutional right to a hearing on the parole revocation process since revocation action arose prior to the United States Supreme Court decision guaranteeing the parolee minimum procedural requirements under the fourteenth amendment in proceedings to re-confine him because of an alleged violation of parole condition.

       <p>
        If the parole board had chosen to hold an immediate hearing and had revoked parole of defendant who was incarcerated in federal penitentiary, then under this section defendant would have still been deemed a “fugitive from justice” until he could be taken into custody under the parole violation warrant and it was not possible to take him into custody under that warrant so long as he remained within the custody of the federal authorities.

       <p>
        Parole officer had no lawful Fourth Amendment basis to enter the parolee defendant’s residence to conduct a warrantless search without defendant’s consent; that defendant recently tested positive for drugs and defendant’s use of drugs was a parole violation and that the officers smelled marijuana when defendant opened defendant’s front door, these facts did not create reasonable suspicion to enter defendant’s residence without defendant’s consent or a search warrant. Defendant’s parole agreement to allow defendant’s parole officer to enter defendant’s residence, and refusal to consent to entry, was a parole violation which made defendant subject to immediate arrest for a parole violation (KRS 439.430(1)); but the officers did not arrest defendant until after the search, and so the search was not incidental to a lawful arrest. No search warrant exceptions overrode defendant’s expectation of privacy in defendant’s home. Coleman v. Commonwealth, 100 S.W.3d 745, 2002 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

       Where a parole officer believes that a parolee has violated the terms of his release, the officer must, when arresting the parolee pursuant to this section, obtain an arrest or search warrant to make an arrest of the parolee in the parolee’s residence, absent exigent circumstances, since the theory that a prisoner on parole is merely experiencing a change in the form of custody, in his best interest, does not support an increased freedom to invade the parolee’s privacy; however, in obtaining the warrant, the lesser standard of reasonable cause should be applied. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-209</cite>.

      <p>
       Under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.352" target="_self">KRS 439.352</a></cite>, a parolee is automatically recommitted to prison if he has received a new sentence for the commission of a crime while on parole. Even though an appeal is granted and an appeal bond set, the parolee can be legally held by the state parole authorities because he is still in their custody by virtue of his sentence from which he was originally paroled. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-267</cite>.

       There is no statute which prohibits a jailer from making “trustees” out of parole violators, who are lodged in county jails with detainers awaiting hearings or a warrant from the Parole Board. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-287</cite>.

        Prisoner received hearing before parole board within the meaning of this statute, even though the board elected to accept the parole officer’s report and recommendation that he be returned to prison, as this was clearly within the sound discretion of the board. Evans v. Thomas, 372 S.W.2d 798, 1963 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 148</cite> (Ky. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 934, 84 S. Ct. 705, 11 L. Ed. 2d 653, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 1760 (U.S. 1964).

       <p>
        Where a prisoner’s parole is revoked and he is not given a hearing until 40 days after his return to prison instead of the 30 days directed by this section, mandamus, not habeas corpus, is the proper remedy for an abuse of authority by the parole board in connection with a rearrest and revocation of parole.

        The intent of the legislature in this section was to create a “privilege” statute consistent with the general principles of privileged communication. Tabor v. Commonwealth, 625 S.W.2d 571, 1981 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 301</cite> (Ky. 1981).

        The status information required to prove the charges in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc532s532.080" target="_blank">KRS 532.080</a></cite> concerning the sentencing of persistent felony offenders is not privileged and may be testified to by any witness, including probation and parole officers; the 1976 amendment to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc532s532.080" target="_blank">KRS 532.080</a></cite>, which made the dates of imprisonment and discharge from probation, parole or imprisonment, as well as probation and parole status, essential elements of proof for persistent felony offender status, cannot be presumed to be nullified by the prohibition against disclosure of the same information in this section. Tabor v. Commonwealth, 625 S.W.2d 571, 1981 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 301</cite> (Ky. 1981).

        Testimony given from records by a parole officer concerning the defendant’s birth date and release date on a prior conviction did not violate this section, particularly since the testimony regarded facts which were not obtained from the parolee in the form of privileged communications.

        Where defendant sought information possessed by the secretary of Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections) to assist his psychiatrists in preparing an insanity defense, the motion was properly denied on the basis of this section as such information is to be used solely for probation and parole purposes.

        A criminal defendant is not entitled to a copy of his or her presentence investigation report both at the presentence and post-conviction stages. Commonwealth v. Bush, 740 S.W.2d 943, 1987 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 264</cite> (Ky. 1987).

        To conform with the “fair opportunity” afforded a defendant by subsection (4) (now (6)) of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc532s532.050" target="_blank">KRS 532.050</a></cite>, a defendant is entitled to being advised by the prison official who has custody of the presentence investigation report of the factual contents and conclusions therein and to a reasonable time to controvert factual information contained therein, but in order to protect the sources of confidential information, matters of opinion and comments of a personal and nonfactual nature shall not be revealed, and a defendant is not entitled to a copy of the report. Commonwealth v. Bush, 740 S.W.2d 943, 1987 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 264</cite> (Ky. 1987).

        A defendant who was indicted on two counts of first-degree robbery and for being a persistent felony offender, but as to whom one robbery count and the persistent felon count were dismissed as part of a plea bargain, was not entitled to have the dismissed charges segregated from the presentence investigation report in the hands of the Parole Board.

       Inspection of the presentence investigation report (PSI) remains closed except to the court, Parole Board, or Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections) pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11j" target="_blank">KRS 61.878(1)(j)</a></cite> and this section although these agencies may order otherwise. Interpretation of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc532s532.050ol14" target="_blank">KRS 532.050(4)</a></cite> indicates that there is a question as to whether the PSI itself should be released for inspection even to the defendant or his counsel. Statutory language only requires the court to advise of factual contents and conclusions; it does not require inspection. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-285</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections), Department of Community Services and Facilities, properly denied, pursuant to subdivision (1)(j) of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878" target="_blank">KRS 61.878</a></cite> and this section, the request to inspect documents prepared and submitted by a parole officer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 88-14</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kentucky Parole Board acted consistent with Open Records provisions in denying, as privileged pursuant to statute, a parole officer’s “Special Report.” <cite class="OAG"> OAG 90-32</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A request for access to a special report to the parole board by a parole officer was properly denied as the report was prepared by a probation and parole officer in the discharge of his official duties and, therefore, the record was exempt from disclosure under this section. OAG 99-ORD-55.
      </p>
      <p>
       A correctional facility did not violate the Open Records Act in denying an inmate’s request for his presentence investigation report since such report was confidential under this section. OAG 99-ORD-216.
      </p>
      <p>
       An agency which provided substance abuse treatment services at a halfway house properly denied a request for a letter and other records prepared by the probation and parole officer pertaining to the requester’s husband pursuant to this section and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11l" target="_blank">KRS 61.878(1)(l)</a></cite> since these statutes operated in tandem to exclude from inspection all information obtained in the discharge of official duty by any probation or parole officer. OAG 00-ORD-45.
      </p>
      <p>
       <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11k" target="_blank">KRS 61.878(1)(k)</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11l" target="_blank">61.878(1)(l)</a></cite>, when read in tandem with 28 USCS § 534 and this section, respectively, prohibited the disclosure of the requester’s rap sheet, the record which contains the requester’s entire criminal record, and a presentence investigation report, which contained the rap sheet and which was prepared by the probation and parole officer as part of his official duties. OAG 00-ORD-85.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the defendant did not waive his PSI, and was advised of its contents at sentencing pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc532s532.050ol16" target="_blank">KRS 532.050(6)</a></cite>, he is foreclosed from being advised of its contents under a open records request because <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.510" target="_self">KRS 439.510</a></cite> makes the report confidential. While the agencies are not required to furnish him with a copy of the report in either case, if he waived his PSI at sentencing, he is entitled to be advised by the prison official who has custody of it of the factual contents and conclusions therein. OAG 01-ORD-13.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the two-page Memorandum sought by the requester was prepared by a probation and parole officer in the discharge of his official duties, the record, pursuant <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.510" target="_self">KRS 439.510</a></cite>, would be exempt from disclosure and could properly be denied under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11l" target="_blank">KRS 61.878(1)(l)</a></cite>. Accordingly, the adjustment center’s denial of the request was correct and in accord with provisions of the Open Records Act. OAG 01-ORD-52.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parole officer’s “contemporaneous handwritten notes” and any other records the agency may have “relating to this matter” fall squarely within the parameters of the privilege established at <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.510" target="_self">KRS 439.510</a></cite>, incorporated into the Open Records Act by operation of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11l" target="_blank">KRS 61.878(1)(l)</a></cite>. This privilege does not terminate upon revocation of an individual’s parole, and cannot be waived by the parolee. OAG 01-ORD-97.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the case notes of the parolee’s visits with his parole officer were prepared as a result of the officer’s official duties, these records, pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.510" target="_self">KRS 439.510</a></cite>, would be exempt from disclosure and may be properly denied under an Open Records Request pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11l" target="_blank">KRS 61.878(1)(l)</a></cite>. OAG 02-ORD-51.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Division of Probation and Parole did not violate the Open Records Act in denying an inmate’s request for copies of certain casebook narratives on the basis of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc439s439.510" target="_self">KRS 439.510</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.878ol11l" target="_blank">KRS 61.878(1)(l)</a></cite>.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The power of a court to place a defendant on probation under this section depends on compliance with all its conditions, and it is incumbent upon one who invokes its protection to show that those conditions have been met. Bray v. Weaver, 453 S.W.2d 7, 1970 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 291</cite> (Ky. 1970) (decision prior to 1972 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record did not show compliance with this section and it affirmatively disclosed the absence of any provision for the terms, conditions and duration of the probation, the part of the judgment that purported to “suspend” the jail sentence was unauthorized surplusage. Bray v. Weaver, 453 S.W.2d 7, 1970 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 291</cite> (Ky. 1970) (decision prior to 1972 amendment).

      PURPOSE
     </h3>
     <p>
      The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, this compact will: create a interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

        Trial court’s conclusion that the trial court only had the authority to award restitution if the trial court ordered that defendant be sentenced to probation or if defendant had a chance for parole was flawed as it would mean that a defendant who had committed a crime so severe that the defendant was not eligible for probation or parole would not have to pay restitution while a defendant who committed a lesser crime allowing for probation or parole would have to pay restitution, which was clearly not what the legislature intended.

       Under the statutes relating to the duties of the Secretary of the Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections), penal institutions must be directly supervised, administered and operated by the Corrections Cabinet; there are no statutes permitting the delegation of such operational function to any other agency or to private enterprise. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-356</cite>.

      <p>
       Under this section, where the correctional center is to be established in unincorporated territory of a county, the fiscal court would have to approve the precise location or site of such correctional center; the approval of the legislature of the city government would be necessary where the location is within the boundaries of an incorporated city. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-356</cite>.

      Any officer and his sureties shall be liable, in an action upon his official bond, for the use of the parties aggrieved, in any damages resulting from his voluntarily or negligently permitting the escape of a prisoner in custody. No judgment in such action shall be given unless the jury, by its verdict, finds “that the escape was with the consent of the officer, or by his negligence, or that the prisoner might have been retaken if the officer had, in good faith, made proper efforts to do so.”

     <p>
      When the Governor of this state makes requisition upon the Governor of another state for a fugitive from justice, the person named in the requisition as the agent of this state shall, unless a different condition is contained in his commission, be allowed as compensation from the State Treasury for his services a mileage allowance at the same rate fixed by regulations adopted by the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc44s44.060" target="_blank">KRS 44.060</a></cite>, plus an additional sum calculated at the rate of five cents ($0.05) per mile for the distance he travels to and from the jail of the county designated in the proclamation to the place where the fugitive is arrested, and any other necessary expenses he pays in reclaiming and returning the fugitive. If, in attempting to reclaim the fugitive, the agent is acting within the course and scope of his employment, the amount due shall be paid over to the agent’s employer instead of the agent. When a fugitive is to be returned to this state from a location out of state which is in excess of five hundred (500) miles from the jail to which he is to be returned, commercial air transportation may be utilized in lieu of ground transportation, unless the agent undertaking the transportation decides to utilize ground transportation. Payment for air transportation shall be in lieu of the mileage payment for ground transportation only for that portion of the journey for which air transportation is used. Ground transportation and other expenses shall be paid as authorized herein. If the agent is not given possession of the fugitive for reasons beyond the agent’s control, he, or his employer, shall nevertheless be allowed the compensation prescribed by this section. Upon the return of the fugitive to the county in which the jail named in the proclamation is located, the person having him in charge shall go before a judge, who shall issue a mittimus to the jailer to receive the prisoner and keep him until he is discharged.

       It was proper for the department of finance (now Finance and Administration Cabinet) to pay the expenses of both a state trooper and his matron assistant when they were commissioned to escort a dangerous female fugitive back to Kentucky. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 60-1096</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The decision of whether under the circumstances of a particular case more than one agent is required to be named rests with the governor in the exercise of his reasonable discretion. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-62</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The governor has authority to name more than one person in his requisition and to commission such parties as agents of this state when it is made to appear that the circumstances of the case reasonably require the naming of more than one agent. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-62</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The papers constituting the application for requisition should set out the reasons for the appointment of an extra agent. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-62</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.380ol11" target="_self">KRS 440.380(1)</a></cite> a person appointed by order of the county judge as agent of this state to return a fugitive upon waiver of extradition is not entitled to reimbursement of expenses as provided in this section unless the order of appointment was entered prior to the departure of the agent from this state. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-108</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the transportation of a dangerous fugitive being returned to Kentucky by one agent, the governor could issue his commission to a second agent without processing the second agent’s papers as a separate application for requisition and without issuing a second requisition upon the governor of the state detaining the fugitive. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-296</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the commissioned agent could have learned prior to making a trip to return a person being extradited that the person was not at that time available for extradition, he was not entitled to reimbursement of his travel expenses. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 66-414</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not authorize the reimbursement of a county of another state for medical expenses deemed necessary for a fugitive while he is being held for Kentucky authorities after having waived jurisdiction. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-669</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.380" target="_self">KRS 440.380</a></cite> a state’s agent for the return of a fugitive is appointed and the final return of the fugitive to another state has been made by that state a condition precedent to the release of the fugitive to the Kentucky authorities, the state’s agent may recover his mileage and other necessary expenses for the two round trips involved in view of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.200" target="_self">KRS 440.200</a></cite> and this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-373</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commonwealth of Kentucky must compensate those agents appointed by the Governor to transfer a fugitive from the jurisdiction of a foreign country back to Kentucky for trial for all expenses incurred. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-104</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agents appointed by the Governor to transfer fugitives from the jurisdiction of a foreign country to Kentucky for trial are not only agents of the Commonwealth of Kentucky but are also agents of the United States government whose authority they exercise while in the foreign country. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-104</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under 18 USCS § 3195, Kentucky is required to reimburse Pennsylvania for “all costs and expenses” incurred by that state in complying with a Kentucky extradition request, but under this section the state treasury is only required to reimburse the agent for the “necessary expenses” he pays in claiming and returning the fugitive, and it may be that some portion of the bill for housing was not a “necessary expense,” therefore if Jefferson County or the agent is found to have unduly delayed in taking custody of the prisoner after being notified that he was available, that portion of the bill attributable to the delay may not be a “necessary expense,” and the agent not entitled to reimbursement. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-432</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where Jefferson County initiated extradition from Pennsylvania, and that state submitted an invoice, for over $2,200 for housing the prisoner pending extradition, to Kentucky, the Commonwealth is the proper recipient of the invoice and must pay the bill. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-432</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a fugitive being extradited from Florida challenged his extradition in a habeas corpus proceeding in that state thereby requiring a county to send an identification witness, accompanied by her custodian and the sheriff, to Florida to testify in the proceeding, the county may recover from the state under this section for the actual costs of transportation, meals and lodging expenses for the witness and her custodian; reimbursement for the costs of the sheriff depends on his function on the trip; if he went merely as a guard for the witness, his costs would be recoverable; if, however, he went as to the agent to transport the fugitive back to the county, he would receive his mileage and the additional sum mentioned in this section, but not the costs of his meals and lodging. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-243</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section was historically designed to emphasize land travel, the statute is so broad that when read in its entirety it covers any kind of transportation authorized under current state travel regulations. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-314</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an extradition agent’s travel is properly by plane under the state travel regu- lation, the agent should be reimbursed for the cost of coach/tourist class airline travel, including the similar air travel cost for the prisoner, but such reimbursement is limited to the actual cost of the airfare or air flight tickets purchased, and thus the air travel cost is not based upon a mileage factor. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-314</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An extradition agent’s meals and lodging are restricted to that generally allowed by department of finance travel regulations. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-387</cite> (withdrawing <cite class="OAG"> OAG 67-379</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state agent in extradition is entitled to 18 cents per mile, pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc44s44.060" target="_blank">KRS 44.060</a></cite>, plus five ($0.05) cents per mile; in addition, he is entitled to any other necessary expenses he pays in reclaiming and returning the fugitive, including the costs of food and lodging for himself and for the prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-387</cite> (withdrawing <cite class="OAG"> OAG 67-379</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where two (2) extradition agents travel together the second agent (one who rides in vehicle owned by first agent) is not entitled to the mileage allowance. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-387</cite> (with- drawing <cite class="OAG"> OAG 67-379</cite>).
      </p>
      <p>
       This fiscal court does not have to approve the deputies’ reimbursement for their mileage and other expenses under this section or their trip expenditures. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-42</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc44s44.020" target="_blank">KRS 44.020</a></cite> would not apply to this section, even though the return of a fugitive or extradition is effected through the Governor of Kentucky, since the fugitive is brought back and placed in the jail of the county designated in the proclamation; thus, extradition is ac- complished outside the frame of litigation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-336</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where fugitive was returned from Texas to Kentucky without making a rendition demand upon the Governor of Texas because the fugitive waived formal extradition proceedings, the sheriff’s department is not entitled to reimbursement for expenses. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 90-98</cite>.

     Reward for apprehension of fugitive from justice.
     </h3>
     <p>
      In aggravated cases of murder and other felonies against the person when the accused flees from justice, the Governor, on petition of the Circuit or District Judge of the county, may issue a proclamation offering a reward of not more than five hundred dollars ($500) for the apprehension of the accused. This reward shall be paid upon production of a receipt from the officer named in the Governor’s proclamation, showing delivery of the fugitive to him, approved and certified by the Circuit Court of the county of that officer’s residence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        When delivery was made after the reward was offered it is immaterial that claimant took the fugitive into custody before the reward was offered, provided he acted in good faith. Coffey v. Commonwealth, 37 S.W. 575, 18 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 646</cite> (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not necessary that claimant personally and alone make the arrest, for the essential fact is the causing of the arrest. Stone v. Wickliffe, 106 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 252</cite>, 50 S.W. 44, 20 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1806</cite>, 1899 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 29</cite> (Ky. 1899).

        2.Delivery of Prisoner.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Recital in jailer’s receipt that another person was with claimant at time of delivery does not contradict averment that claimant delivered the prisoner. Stone v. Wickliffe, 106 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 252</cite>, 50 S.W. 44, 20 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1806</cite>, 1899 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 29</cite> (Ky. 1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        One who arrests the fugitive and delivers him to a jail other than the one designated in the proclamation is entitled to the reward as against one who delivered the prisoner to the jail designated. Collier v. Green, 205 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 361</cite>, 265 S.W. 812, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 111</cite> (Ky. 1924).

        3.— Officer’s Receipt.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Motion in Circuit Court for allowance of the reward is equivalent to a motion for an order approving and certifying the officer’s receipt. Coffey v. Commonwealth, 37 S.W. 575, 18 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 646</cite> (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        The reward can be paid only upon production of the officer’s receipt, approved and certified by the Circuit Court of that officer’s residence. Coffey v. Commonwealth, 37 S.W. 575, 18 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 646</cite> (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that the claimant, who attempted to take the prisoner from plaintiff’s custody, accompanied plaintiff and his prisoner to the jail and objected to approval and certification of plaintiff’s receipt did not justify court in dismissing the proceedings. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 76 S.W. 832, 25 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 986</cite> (1903).

       </h5>
       <p>
        When claimant has apprehended the fugitive who, before he can be delivered, dies of wounds necessarily inflicted during the arrest, the claimant has substantially complied with an offer of reward for the arrest and delivery of the fugitive. Mosley v. Stone, 108 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 492</cite>, 56 S.W. 965, 22 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 173</cite>, 1900 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 70</cite> (Ky. 1900).

        A proclamation offering a reward for the apprehension and conviction of the guilty party refers to final conviction. Stone v. Wickliffe, 106 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 252</cite>, 50 S.W. 44, 20 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1806</cite>, 1899 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 29</cite> (Ky. 1899).

        An officer under the duty of making the arrest cannot claim the reward. Riley v. Grace, 33 S.W. 207, 17 <cite class="ky_rptr_code"> Ky. L. Rptr. 1007</cite> (1895). See Smitha v.

       </p>
       <p>
        A public officer making the arrest while acting outside the line of his official duties is entitled to the reward. Collier v. Green, 205 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 361</cite>, 265 S.W. 812, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 111</cite> (Ky. 1924).

       Whenever the Governor issues a proclamation offering a reward for a fugitive from justice or anyone charged with crime, he shall designate in his proclamation the jail to which the prisoner shall be delivered. It need not be the jail of the county where the offense was committed.

The account for such publication, with the approval of the Governor endorsed on it, shall be paid out of the State Treasury.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Although the defendant was denied his right to petition the Governor of Kentucky to disapprove Ohio’s request for temporary custody under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (I.A.D. <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.450" target="_self">KRS 440.450</a></cite>), and he was not allowed the opportunity to file a writ of habeas corpus under the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, defendant never served a sentence in Ohio but was immediately returned to this state as the I.A.D. required; therefore, defendant’s transfer from Kentucky to Ohio to stand trial for rape and abduction charges there was not violative of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act and the I.A.D. and Kentucky had jurisdiction over him to carry out his execution.

The indictment, information, or affidavit made before the magistrate must substantially charge the person demanded with having committed a crime under the law of that state; and the copy of indictment, information, affidavit, judgment of conviction, or sentence must be authenticated by the executive authority making the demand.

        The requirement that the copy of the indictment, affidavit, or information accompanying the demand for extradition must substantially charge the person demanded with having committed a crime does not apply to the warrant of arrest, which need only state the fact that such an indictment, information or affidavit has been received and describe in general terms of identification the offense charged.

       An affidavit charging an offense in extradition papers was made before a magistrate if it appears that under the statutory law of the demanding state the person before whom the affidavit was made has power to take complaints and issue warrants of arrest. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-244</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extradition papers from Ohio were sufficient under the statute although the affidavit was sworn to before a clerk of a municipal court, since such official may be classified as a magistrate for purposes of extradition. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-244</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commonwealth Attorney was correct with regard to procedure concerning issuance of a fugitive warrant pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.270" target="_self">KRS 440.270</a></cite>, whereby pending completion of extradition documents, the prisoner is held in the local jail. However, the best procedure is to have the demanding state submit its extradition documents to Kentucky before the release date and serve the Kentucky Governor’s Warrant on the fugitive at the time he is released from federal prison. Utilizing this method the necessity of a judicial fugitive warrant is avoided and the fugitive is held in the local jail on an executive warrant. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-46</cite>.

        Where a person is arrested in another jurisdiction for conduct in the other jurisdiction and the other jurisdiction extradites him to Kentucky, the Kentucky courts will not determine whether the other jurisdiction, by so extraditing him, forfeited its rights to enforce its charges against him. Brewster v. Luby, 380 S.W.2d 261, 1964 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 305</cite> (Ky. 1964).

        Where prisoner who was free on bond in murder case pending in Tennessee was extradited to Kentucky, tried and convicted of forgery and later released after serving 18 months of his sentence and thereupon arrested as a fugitive and held for Tennessee authorities, the Tennessee rather than the Kentucky court should determine whether Tennessee waived the charges against him by extraditing him to Kentucky.

        The power to extradite was lodged in the Governor, his decision for or against extradition was final and not subject to judicial review and he was not required by law to make demand upon the executive authority of another state for arrest and return of a fugitive from justice.

        Unpublished decision:
    Given that defendant did not show that the Commonwealth of Kentucky ever filed a detainer with Oklahoma authorities; instead, the Commonwealth obtained custody of defendant by extraditing him pursuant to an executive agreement authorized by the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.200ol11" target="_self">KRS 440.200(1)</a></cite>; the 120-day clock of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.450" target="_self">KRS 440.450</a></cite>, was inapplicable to defendant’s indictment; thus, defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial.

       A person who has been paroled and permitted by the parole board to go to another state to reside and who is thereafter indicted in Kentucky for another crime may be extradited under this section, even though he is in the other state pursuant to permission from the Kentucky state parole board and his parole is still in effect. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 68-40</cite>.

       Where temporary custody of a fugitive was obtained by virtue of an executive agreement which limited the purpose of the temporary custody solely to the prosecution of charges pending before a Kentucky Circuit Court and which provided for the return of the fugitive to Oklahoma following either his acquittal or conviction in the Kentucky court, the commitment of the fugitive to the Kentucky Bureau of Corrections (now Department of Corrections) was in violation of this section and the executive agreement, and though the time erroneously spent in the Kentucky correctional facility could be credited against the Oklahoma sentence, the time could not be counted toward the completion of the Kentucky sentence. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-666</cite>.

       A person arrested upon a fugitive warrant charging him with the offense of nonsupport committed in the state of Ohio may, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.300" target="_self">KRS 440.300</a></cite>, be admitted to bail and the court may set a time in the future for a hearing upon the fugitive warrant pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.290" target="_self">KRS 440.290</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-63</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If extradition papers are received while the fugitive is awaiting a hearing and a rendition warrant is issued by the Governor of Kentucky, the Governor’s warrant of arrest will supplant the proceedings under the fugitive warrant. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-63</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When out-of-state parolees are thought to have violated the terms of their parole or probation and the authorities of the sending state desire their arrest and return, they may be arrested and detained pending arrival of officers of the demanding state by a fugitive warrant issued under this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-742</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commonwealth Attorney was correct with regard to procedure concerning issuance of a fugitive warrant pursuant to this section, whereby pending completion of extradition documents, the prisoner is held in the local jail. However, the best procedure is to have the demanding state submit its extradition documents to Kentucky before the release date and serve the Kentucky Governor’s Warrant on the fugitive at the time he is released from federal prison. Utilizing this method, the necessity of a judicial fugitive warrant is avoided and the fugitive is held in the local jail on an executive warrant. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-46</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “fled from justice” is a term of art used throughout the laws on extradition and refers to an individual charged with or convicted of a crime in one state and for whatever reason is found in another state. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-46</cite>.

        Where a person was convicted and sentenced by a Kentucky court, turned over to federal officers by local Kentucky officers without authority, convicted and sentenced by the federal authorities, served his federal sentence and was then released by the federal authorities to state authorities who committed him to serve the original state sentence, the trial court properly granted a writ of habeas corpus because the state forfeited its right to enforce the original sentence by turning him over to the federal officers without proper authority.

        The paroling of a convict to the authorities of another jurisdiction for trial upon a criminal charge constitutes a permanent waiver of the right to recommit such convict for violations of the terms of his parole.

        Where a prisoner of one state is transferred without reservation and without consent to a second state in order that he may be subjected to confinement in the latter, the question upon his release in the second state of whether he is a fugitive from justice and thus properly extraditable is one of state policy to be determined by the first state.

        Where accused was granted probation after conviction and then held by officers until arrival of officers of foreign state who took him to the foreign state after he had waived extradition and was then convicted and served two and one half (2 1/2) years in prison, his probation could be revoked and there was no waiver of jurisdiction by the state.

        Where a person was wanted by Kentucky and a second jurisdiction and was arrested by federal officers in a third state, the fact that the federal officers turned him over to the other jurisdiction was not a forfeiture by Kentucky of its right to prosecute him upon completion of his sentence in the other jurisdiction. Chick v. Commonwealth, 405 S.W.2d 14, 1966 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 236</cite> (Ky.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 977, 87 S. Ct. 518, 17 L. Ed. 2d 439, 1966 U.S. LEXIS 134 (U.S. 1966).

        Petitioner who committed a crime in Virginia while on parole on 1945 Kentucky conviction and was extradited according to statutory processes to Virginia where he served a sentence and was paroled and sent to Florida under supervisory arrangement although Kentucky had asked that he be detained, was not entitled to release after he was again apprehended in Kentucky and returned to confinement under the 1945 sentence, as Kentucky had not forfeited its rights by extraditing him or by delay on parole violation.

        The document styled “Detainer Warrant,” stating that, due to the fact that a fine was imposed, the court needed the defendant to return to the corrections department at the time which he was released from federal prison, was a nullity where the sentence imposed a fine, not imprisonment, the defendant was not serving time for this offense when he was transferred back to federal prison, and he had not been adjudicated in default of payment of the fine.

        In order to overcome the prima facie case made by Governor’s warrant, the person held upon such warrant, his identity having been established, had the burden of showing absence from the demanding state at the time of the alleged crime, or that he was not a fugitive from justice; and the court could not discharge the petitioner where there was merely contradictory evidence on the subject of presence or absence from the demanding state, for it was not the function of the writ to try a question of alibi or to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.

       Opinions of Attorney General.

      <p>
       Under this section a person appointed by order of the county judge as agent of this state to return a fugitive upon waiver of extradition is not entitled to reimbursement of expenses as provided in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.090" target="_self">KRS 440.090</a></cite> unless the order of appointment was entered prior to the departure of the agent from this state. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-108</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county judge has discretion in the matter of designating more than one agent to return a fugitive. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-676</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section the county judge has authority to enter an order designating two (2) officers to return a fugitive when this is requested by the county attorney or Commonwealth’s attorney and information is furnished indicating the need for more than one (1) agent. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-676</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the county judge has appointed two (2) officers to return a fugitive under subsection (1) of this section and their papers are otherwise in order, both officers are entitled to be paid their expenses in the same manner in which two (2) agents designated in the Governor’s requisition are paid under this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 63-676</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it is not mandatory that a county judge sign an order designating an agent to return a fugitive from justice, he should exercise reasonable discretion and any refusal should be based upon proper grounds. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 65-149</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where two (2) agents are appointed to return a fugitive from another state in an extradition case and employ only one private vehicle for their journey to and from the asylum state, the statute requires that each should be compensated at the rate of 10¢ per mile and other necessary expenses. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 67-379</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.450" target="_self">KRS 440.450</a></cite>, a prisoner is to be brought from another state to Kentucky and then returned to the other state, the state’s agent to return the prisoner should be appointed by the county judge under this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-373</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not authorize a Circuit Judge to designate the state’s agent for the return of a fugitive and he has no “inherent power” to make such appointment, it being immaterial that he exercises appellate jurisdiction over the county court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-373</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where under this section a state’s agent for the return of a fugitive is appointed and the final return of the fugitive to another state has been made by that state a condition precedent to the release of the fugitive to the Kentucky authorities, the state’s agent may recover his mileage and other necessary expenses for the two (2) round trips involved in view of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.090" target="_self">KRS 440.090</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.200" target="_self">440.200.</a></cite> <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-373</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state is not liable to pay the fees or expenses of boarding prisoners held under fugitive warrants in county jails pursuant to interstate extradition. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-807</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Kentucky is the demanding authority in extradition matters, even if there was a waiver of the full extradition process by the other state, the legal costs incurred in making the fugitive available must be borne by Kentucky. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-815</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section an order designating an officer to return the fugitive to this State without the benefit of any procedure incidental to extradition proceedings must still be signed by the county judge/executive, since such an order is clearly an executive function requiring the county judge/executive’s authorization. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 78-398</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county judge/executive is not authorized to sign an order under this section in cases of waiver of extradition involving a fugitive charged with a misdemeanor and, therefore, the prosecuting attorney is required to make formal application to the Governor under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.370" target="_self">KRS 440.370</a></cite> in order to secure the appointment of an agent who will be paid travel expenses. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 90-98</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department for Local Government properly denied request for reimbursement of expenses on the grounds that this section does not authorize reimbursement for expenses incurred in the return of a fugitive charged with a misdemeanor. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 90-98</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Governor of Kentucky is the only state official who has authority to designate an officer or agent for the Commonwealth of Kentucky to return a fugitive from another state to Kentucky when that fugitive is charged with a misdemeanor and has waived formal extradition proceedings. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 90-98</cite>.

      The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.

The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The purpose of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act was to insure a speedy trial and to prevent punitive detainers. Shanks v. Commonwealth, 574 S.W.2d 688, 1978 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 630</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1978), overruled, Commonwealth v. Ingram, 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 997 (Ky. Ct. App. May 5, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the goals of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) is expeditious disposition of charges pending against a prisoner in a state other than the one where he is detained; it is a vehicle by which an accused’s constitutional right to a speedy trial is assured when he complies with the terms of the agreement. Ivey v. Commonwealth, 655 S.W.2d 506, 1983 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 345</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1983).

        3.Trial Requirement of Article IV.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act does not require a final disposition of the case before the prisoner is returned to the federal authorities pursuant to Article V(5), which section requires the prisoner to be returned “[a]t the earliest practicable time” since Article IV(5) of this section requires a “trial,” not a final disposition. Shanks v. Commonwealth, 574 S.W.2d 688, 1978 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 630</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1978), overruled, Commonwealth v. Ingram, 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 997 (Ky. Ct. App. May 5, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        While Article III and IV of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) do not require a formal proceeding in open court, it is necessary that the prisoner or his counsel and a judge be present; thus, a pretrial conference in the clerk’s office, with the trial judge and attorneys for both sides present, satisfies the open court requirement. Roberson v. Commonwealth, 913 S.W.2d 310, 1994 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 150</cite> (Ky. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 180-day time period set forth in Article III of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) was not triggered since the proper Commonwealth’s attorney never received the detainee’s request. The 120-day time period of Article IV of the IAD was not violated because the delay in bringing the detainee to trial was for good cause, being the result of detainee’s own motions, which, in effect, constituted a voluntary waiver of his right to be prosecuted within the statutory time limit. Wright v. Commonwealth, 953 S.W.2d 611, 1997 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 107</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).

        4.— Pretransfer Hearing.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Inasmuch as defendant had a pre-existing right by way of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act for a pretransfer hearing, it was concluded that that right remained under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, Article IV, § 4 of this section. Commonwealth, Corrections Cabinet v. Ramsey, 828 S.W.2d 662, 1991 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 142</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1991).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum is issued prior to a detainer, it is not a detainer within the meaning of the agreement. Shanks v. Commonwealth, 574 S.W.2d 688, 1978 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 630</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1978), overruled, Commonwealth v. Ingram, 2006 Ky. App. Unpub. LEXIS 997 (Ky. Ct.

        It is in the interest of sound judicial administration, and consistent with established principles, to require prisoners challenging extradition actions to pursue the remedies provided by the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (KRS 440.450) before seeking habeas relief in federal court. Norton v. Parke, 892 F.2d 476, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 19331 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1989</cite>), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1060, 110 S. Ct. 1533, 108 L.

        6.Speedy Trial.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where defendant escaped from the state reformatory in June, 1975, was imprisoned in Ohio, had a warrant issued against him for escape November 2, 1976, was indicted February, 1977, had made two (2) demands for a speedy trial by August, 1977, was returned to Kentucky in November, 1977, had a trial scheduled for February 10, 1978, and succeeded in getting the indictment dismissed on February 6, 1978, the trial court committed reversible error in dismissing the indictment, since the warden’s warrant was not a detainer within this section and the trial date in February was within 180 days of the August demand for trial so as to render the trial a speedy one. Commonwealth v. Monroe, 580 S.W.2d 722, 1979 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 399</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The warden’s warrant issued pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.010" target="_self">KRS 440.010</a></cite> is only a notice to appropriate authorities that an individual is an escapee from a penal institution in Kentucky and, in and of itself, is not a request for a detainer which would be subject to the terms of the interstate agreement on detainers. Commonwealth v. Monroe, 580 S.W.2d 722, 1979 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 399</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s motion for a speedy trial, filed August 6, 1990, was insufficient to trigger the 180-day time limitation of Article III of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) codified in this section; to invoke the Article III terms a defendant has to request to be tried in accordance with the IAD; but defendant’s motion for a speedy trial made no reference to the I.A.D. or the 180-day time limitation and defendant failed to comply with Article III which specifically requires that a request for disposition be accompanied by a certificate from the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner detailing specific information about the prison term in the sending state. Ellis v. Commonwealth, 828 S.W.2d 360, 1992 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 110</cite> (Ky. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since there was no evidence that a detainer had been lodged against the defendant, who was incarcerated on other charges when he first demanded a speedy dispositon of charges against him, he had not yet acquired any right to proceed under either <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.50.html#tLc500s500.110" target="_blank">KRS 500.110</a></cite> or this section and he was not denied the right to a speedy trial; it did not need to be decided which of these two (2) substantially identical statutory provisions applied. Rushin v. Commonwealth, 931 S.W.2d 456, 1996 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 73</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Kentucky officials had not yet lodged a detainer against defendant with foreign authorities when he directly communicated his demand for a speedy trial, the trial court did not err in concluding that defendant did not activate the 180-day limit; therefore, since defendant had not acquired any right to proceed at the time he made the demand, he could not have been “thwarted” by any public officials in the pursuit of that right. Schneider v. Commonwealth, 17 S.W.3d 530, 1999 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 154</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The disposition of charges against the defendant was not untimely, notwithstanding that the sending state failed to timely forward documents to Kentucky, where the defendant thereafter agreed to a trial date outside the limits set by the act. Ward v. Commonwealth, 62 S.W.3d 399, 2001 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 34</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant silently acquiesced to a scheduled trial date that exceeded the speedy trial period imposed by <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.450" target="_self">KRS 440.450</a></cite>, Art. IV(3) of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, defendant waived any challenge to that violation. Parks v. Commonwealth, 89 S.W.3d 395, 2002 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 225</cite> (Ky. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s motion to dismiss the charges against him because the trial was not commenced within 180 days pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc440s440.450" target="_self">KRS 440.450</a></cite>, was properly denied because there was no evidence that the Commonwealth’s Attorney or the circuit court had notice that defendant had asked for disposition of the matter within the 180 days. Absent notice to the Commonwealth or the circuit court the 180-day period never commenced. Bryant v. Commonwealth, 199 S.W.3d 169, 2006 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 192</cite> (Ky. 2006).

    592 S.W.2d 133, 1979 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky.

        Defendant’s failure to deliver his request for final disposition of a pending charge in Kentucky under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) to the Circuit Court did not prohibit the commencement of the 180-day period where defendant’s case began as an action in the juvenile branch of the District Court, not in the Circuit Court, and where the county prosecutor’s office had actual notice of his request long before the 180-day period expired.

        The county jail, being used for incarceration of convicted persons for penal purposes, as well as detention or correctional purposes, was determined to be a penal institution within the sense the term is used in the exclusion provisions of the county’s liability policy. Home Indem. Co. v. Johnson County Fiscal Court, 682 F. Supp. 326, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13208 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1987</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides for a separate definition of the terms “jail” and “regional jail.” A jail is defined as a county jail or correctional and detention facility while a regional jail is defined as a jail “owned and operated by two or more counties through a regional jail authority as provided in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.800" target="_self">KRS 441.800</a></cite>.” Regional Jail Authority v.

       For the purpose of obtaining employe fringe benefits, the county is responsible for paying on behalf of jail personnel, as county employees, social security payments (KRS Ch. 61), workers’ compensation premiums (KRS Ch. 342), unemployment insurance premiums (KRS Ch. 341) and medical insurance coverage (KRS Ch. 67). <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-346</cite>.

       The deputies, matrons and other supporting jail personnel, as defined in subsection (5) (now (6)) of this section, are county employees even though the state contributes financially to the operation of the jail under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.206" target="_self">KRS 441.206</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-346</cite>.

       Under the 1982 statutory enactments relative to jails and jailers, county jailers can now be assisted in the operation of the jail by personnel other than deputy jailers and matrons. The county can hire persons, other than deputy jailers and matrons who are appointed by the jailer, to perform duties as “jail personnel,” and these persons need not be 21 years of age since, they are not peace officers, but should be at least 18 years of age, the age of majority for most purposes. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-383</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jail employees are for general purposes county employees, and on that basis such employees are subject generally to various statutes relating to “county employees” as such; however, while the liability for unlawful acts of deputies rests with the jailer and his bond, nondeputy jail personnel would be subject to dismissal under the procedure of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.710ol17" target="_blank">KRS 67.710(7)</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-423</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing in this section prohibiting a person’s being a deputy jailer or matron and a jail cook at the same time. However, any deputy jailer or matron who puts in more than 40 hours per week would be subject to overtime pay under KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc337" target="_blank">Chapter 337</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-463</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to July 1, 1982, the effective date of the 1982 amendment to this section by Ch. 385, relating to the definition of a “jail,” the jailer, and, if necessary (where jailer had no funds for that purpose) the fiscal court, was responsible for providing for any overtime worked by the deputy jailers. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-626</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may be more than one (1) jail building in any county, and there is no restriction as to its location which is left to the sound discretion of fiscal court as to any jail facility other than the usual one located in the county seat. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-626</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city of the fourth class (like all cities) has no responsibility for providing a jail; in addition, there appear to be no statutes requiring such city to contribute to or pay for the incarceration, housing, transportation, feeding and medical treatment of persons arrested by its officers. However, where the person arrested is charged with violating a city ordinance, the city, if the prisoner is determined to be indigent under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc31s31.120" target="_blank">KRS 31.120</a></cite>, would be responsible for paying nonpostponable medical attention cost involving such prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-299</cite>.

        Since there was no law requiring the director of Jefferson County correctional services department to send a letter to Frankfort, and there was no penalty associated with delivering the letter in Franklin County, but the letter was merely his manner of giving official notification to the Secretary of Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections) that Jefferson County could no longer accommodate state prisoners who were brought to Jefferson County for court appearances, the proper venue in action for declaratory judgment to interpret this section governing incarceration of prisoners was in Jefferson County since if there was a failure to comply with this section it occurred in Jefferson County.

        This section states that a county may provide for the incarceration of prisoners by: “(a) providing and maintaining a jail in the county.” It does not provide that a fiscal court may operate a jail because that is a responsibility granted to the jailer by <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.020" target="_blank">KRS 71.020</a></cite>.

       <p>
        While it is readily understandable why for financial reasons county government should be permitted to make the best use possible of vacant, available jail space, this permissive use is necessarily secondary to the duties and responsibilities imposed by this section and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.045" target="_self">KRS 441.045</a></cite> to “provide for the incarceration of prisoners,” including “rules for the government and cleanliness of the county jail and the comfort and treatment of prisoners.” Lexington-Fayette Urban County Detention Center v.

        The operation of a county jail is a governmental function of fiscal court, and where the fiscal court contracts with a company to provide either the facility or staffing or both, the jail operation enjoys the same immunity from the local zoning regulations as if the fiscal court and its jailer owned and ran the facility.

        Circuit court properly affirmed an urban county government's motion to dismiss because it was not responsible for the costs of incarcerating prisoners not in its possession where the statute at issue began and ended with the premise of possession and that a prisoner's status flowed from that possession and control, the prisoners in the case at issue were prisoners of the counties that had possession and control of them via arrest until those counties relinquished them to another county, which then became responsible for the costs of their incarceration pursuant to an order of that county's courts and for which the jail authority did not have a contract.

       As to any damages caused by the inmates of the sending county that are being held by the holding county pursuant to a contract, the fiscal courts of the holding and sending counties have the authority to specifically contract in order to remove the risk of liability for such damages on the part of the holding county. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-334</cite>.

       In the event an area in the jail building has been approved for detention of juveniles, a county may contract with other counties to receive juveniles and detain them. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-334</cite>.

       This section contains no requirement that the sending county shall guarantee against any jail building damage to the holding county which may be subsequently brought about by the sending county’s prisoners, and thus the holding county would have to look to its own remedies. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-334</cite>.

       While this section contains no guidelines as to the per diem contract rate to be paid by the sending county, the rate must be reasonable, and should at least include these factors: (a) the cost of feeding, supervising and caring for prisoners; and (b) the reasonable allocation of capital construction cost or value of building as a reasonable rental factor. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-334</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Determination of the type, kind and amount of purchases (including food, bed supplies, cleaning supplies, etc.) for the jail is a joint responsibility of the jailer and the fiscal court. The jailer is immediately responsible for the program of necessary purchases, but after consultation and approval of fiscal court, since it is the funding agency. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-344</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court under this section is required to maintain a county jail for the incarceration of prisoners arrested in the county or sentenced or held by order of the courts in the county. This county responsibility extends to feeding and dieting such prisoners. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-344</cite>.

       For the purpose of obtaining employee fringe benefits, the county is responsible for paying on behalf of jail personnel, as county employes, social security payments (KRS Ch. 61), workers’ compensation premiums (KRS Ch. 342), unemployment insurance premiums (KRS Ch. 341) and medical insurance coverage (KRS Ch. 67). <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-346</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is up to the jailer to procure the necessary drivers and guards required to transport prisoners to a jail to be used under a contract with another county; this should be done by closely cooperating with the fiscal court, so that it knows precisely and in detail what is required under that jail plan. The funding of such necessary personnel clearly rests with the fiscal court under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.008" target="_self">KRS 441.008</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.235" target="_self">KRS 441.235</a></cite>) and this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-399</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The transportation of female prisoners may be accomplished by using male or female deputies or guards, provided the prisoners are treated humanely and within the bounds of human decency and good sense. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-399</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court cannot refuse to budget funds for the salaries of the jailer’s necessary deputies and matrons. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-400</cite> (modifying <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-155</cite>, 80-319 and related opinions).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section implicitly gives the fiscal court the authority to determine the prisoner capacity of the local jail in order to intelligently plan for the incarceration of all prisoners subject to the local courts. The number of prisoners would be subject to jail standards, emerging from the jail standards commission pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.011" target="_self">KRS 441.011</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.055" target="_self">KRS 441.055</a></cite>), as adopted by the Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections), and other statutory requirements relating to detention facilities. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-421</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the local jail is at its capacity and the fiscal court contracts with another county or a city to provide detention facilities for such excess, the jailer generally procures the necessary drivers and guards required to transport prisoners to the jail to be used under the contract, and this should be done by closely cooperating with the fiscal court such that it knows precisely and in detail what is required under that jail plan; the funding of such necessary personnel clearly rests with the fiscal court under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.008" target="_self">KRS 441.008</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.235" target="_self">KRS 441.235</a></cite>) and this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-421</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The local fiscal court, not the local jailer, determines the prisoner capacity of the county jail, and when there is no space available in the local jail, as determined by fiscal court policies, the arresting officer may turn over the prisoner to the local jailer, who then must transport the prisoner to the contract facility. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-437</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       City police staff may take an arrested person, where the local courts are not open or available for an appearance, to the local jailer who must accept the prisoner for housing in the local jail, or in the contract jail where no space is available in the local jail, until the court magistrate becomes available. The local jailer must transport such prisoner (who is to be tried locally) to the contract jail, except where otherwise agreed by contract. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-476</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The local fiscal court is responsible for determining the prisoner capacity of the jail. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-476</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the fiscal court’s statutory duty of meeting the minimal jailer salary and other standards, the fiscal court is required to, in consultation with the jailer, adopt an operating budget for the jail. Where a jailer has good reason to believe that a fiscal court has acted arbitrarily in establishing the operating budget for the jail, and the jail operation has no more money for that year, he may seek redress in the Circuit Court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-498</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the fiscal court of the first county has, pursuant to subdivision (2)(b) (now (2)(c)(1)) of this section, contracted with a second county to house prisoners who will be tried by the courts in the first county, the jailer or his deputies of the first county, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, has the responsibility of the transportation of such prisoners to the contract jail and back where necessary, and under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.500ol13" target="_self">KRS 441.500(3)</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.510ol13" target="_self">KRS 441.510(3)</a></cite>) of transporting such prisoners to the proper court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-549</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc337s337.285" target="_blank">KRS 337.285</a></cite> (time and a half) is properly applied (extra time is necessary), then if the “jail budget” part of the county budget does not contain the money to pay for such overtime, the fiscal court is responsible for paying it, since the fiscal court has the overall duty of maintaining a county jail operation regardless of whether it admits an employer-employee relationship or not. In such situation the “employer” is still the jailer under KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc337" target="_blank">Chapter 337</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-625</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jailer should authorize work in excess of 40 hours (per week) only where necessary; where it is shown that a jailer is guilty of mismanagement in authorizing an “overtime situation,” he would be personally liable, and liable on his bond for the payment of the overtime to the deputy or matron and the claim would not be payable from the jail fund or county treasury. Where the overtime is necessary, the claim for overtime must be paid from the jail fund, or from the county treasury generally, where there are no jail budget funds to pay it. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-626</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the enactment of Acts 1982, ch. 385, where the time in excess of 40 hours was authorized by the jailer, the time and one half payment was a claim against the jailer’s fees; where he had no fees available, the county treasurer, where a properly budgeted sum was available, was answerable to such payment for overtime, under the concept that the county jail was a county institution, even though the jailer was immediately in charge of the jail, and the fiscal court was ultimately or derivatively responsible for the effective operation of that county institution. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-626</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (2) of this section, a county fiscal court could enter into a contract, wherein such fiscal court would furnish detention facilities for the prisoners of a second county which had closed its jail because of inadequate facilities; in addition, the counties could enter an interlocal agreement for the use of jail facilities as authorized by subsection (4) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-26</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election by a county to close its jail and to contract with another county for the incarceration of prisoners, as permitted by this section, does not affect the state contribution provided in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.007ol11" target="_self">KRS 441.007(1)</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.206ol11" target="_self">KRS 441.206(1)</a></cite>). <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-26</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compensation to be paid to receiving county by sending county for the keeping of sending county’s prisoners must depend upon the mutual agreement of the two (2) fiscal courts, which agreement should involve a reasonable compensation for the detention services furnished, framed around the actual costs of furnishing such detention facilities; the cost elements could include a consideration of the original construction cost of the receiving county’s jail, the space allotted per prisoner, the cost of utilities, the present cost of replacement of the jail if it had to be rebuilt, the level of standards in terms of what would be considered adequate jail housing, the operational and salary costs relating to the jailer and his deputies, including furnishing of food. An agreement based upon the sending county’s sharing in both the operation and capital construction costs would be equitable, and would meet the fundamental fairness concept expressed in Const., § 2. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-26</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court must provide the jail with proper furnishings and equipment necessary for preparation of food for jail prisoners; this is primarily a direct capital and equipment responsibility of the county, through the fiscal court. In addition, the funds for the food and necessary funds for food preparation personnel must come out of the jail budget of the county budget. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-250</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a first county’s jail is closed and has necessitated the fiscal court’s contracting with other counties for the housing of the county’s prisoners, the jailer of that first county has the responsibility for transporting that county’s prisoners from the now closed county jail to a jail or jails made available under contract by one or more other counties, except as otherwise agreed in such contracts. This responsibility of transporting such county prisoners to the contract jails applies to the first county’s jailer, regardless of whether the arresting officers were city policemen, county policemen, or state police officers. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-299</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An arresting officer in a first county which has closed its jail and contracted with other counties for housing its prisoners has the responsibility of either bringing the arrested person to the proper court, if in session, or to that first county’s jailer for transportation to a contract jail, where the prisoner will await court appearance. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-299</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a housing problem arose relating to the counties’ housing of prisoners convicted of felony and sentenced to a corrections institution such that convicted felons could not be moved immediately to the corrections system from the county jails, and where the Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections) negotiated an arrangement with the Kentucky Jailers Association whereby Corrections would pay the counties (in connection with jail budgets) a $10 fee per day per convict beginning on the seventh day after sentencing and extending until the felon was admitted to the state facility, such fee arrangement as a payment of housing costs of such prisoners was legitimate; however, the housing fee arrangement could not be extended to embrace situations in which state prisoners were brought back to the county jail as witnesses or under an RCr 11.42 proceeding since subsection (1) of this section, in its description of prisoners the county is required to house, does not embrace these two (2) categories of prisoners and since the Corrections part of the state budget does not embrace such categories. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-339</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The operation of the county jail is a joint responsibility of the jailer and fiscal court, and the county judge/executive, when the fiscal court is not in session, is required to implement the policy and formal actions of the fiscal court relating to the fiscal court’s joint operative jail responsibility. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-442</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jailer and fiscal court are jointly responsible for the operation of the jail, and the county judge/executive has an implementing function relating to that joint responsibility. Unless the courts would arrive at a different conclusion in a case in which the issue is clearly and plainly presented, the joint responsibility can be modified only by new legislation pinpointing and delineating with sharpness the relative management responsibilities of the jailer, fiscal court and county judge/executive. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-442</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Off-duty members of a police department, located in a county having no county jail, may serve as assistants to the county jailer and receive compensation from the county for transportation of prisoners to a jail in an adjacent county so long as the police officers are employed as drivers of vehicles or guards; the off-duty police officers could not serve as deputy jailers. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-450</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.030" target="_self">KRS 441.030</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.520" target="_self">KRS 441.520</a></cite>), where there is no jail in County A or the jail there is insecure, or there is danger or probable danger that the defendants incarcerated under any order of the court will be removed from the jail by violence, the Circuit Judge of County A shall by an order of record direct that such prisoners be transferred to County B, the nearest county in which the jail is secure; in that situation, the Circuit Judge of County A is ordering such prisoners to be held in County B and, thus, the fiscal court of County A is responsible for the jail costs occasioned by the jailer in County B, pursuant to subsection (1) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-88</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the statutes make no special provisions for the payment of jail expenses of prisoners moved from one county to another under a change of venue, where the trial, under change of venue, is moved from County A to County B, County B has no statutory basis for charging County A for the costs of incarceration while the prisoner is in the jail in County B; since the prisoner, under a change of venue, is being held in County B by order of the court in County B, as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the fiscal court of County B is responsible for the jail costs while the prisoner is detained in that jail. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-88</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an indigent prisoner is brought to a county jail, and assuming that the particular county has the responsibility under this section to incarcerate the prisoner, the fiscal court of that county, through its jail budget, has to bear the cost of providing necessary medical, dental or psychological care for such prisoner, subject to the applicable exceptions under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.045ol14" target="_self">KRS 441.045(4)</a></cite> and (5). The fact that the jailer refused to incarcerate the prisoner when first brought in on the ground that medical attention was deemed necessary in no way militates against the responsibility of that particular county for paying the prisoner’s medical costs. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-256</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, the fiscal court of a county with a jail would be required to contract with another county, or with other counties, for the incarceration and care of its prisoners; a resolution or order of the fiscal court would be necessary to authorize such a contract or contracts to handle prisoners in excess of the county’s jail space. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-354</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county has no regular jail, but only a holdover jail, and the jailer does not transport prisoners, the jailer must serve as a bailiff to the Circuit and District Courts, as provided for in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.050" target="_blank">KRS 71.050</a></cite>; the fiscal court may also require the jailer to serve as custodian of county buildings and grounds, as provided for in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.130" target="_blank">KRS 67.130</a></cite>. It is up to the fiscal court to designate some suitable person to be in charge of the county holdover. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-6</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       County would be banned under Const., § 162 from paying any claim under an agreement or contract for a project involving the leasing of a detention facility (prison) used to house prisoners from outside as well as within the state, as there is no express authority of law for a county’s entry into such endeavor. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 90-115</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long term housing of prisoners of the State of Kentucky is a function constitutionally mandated to the state, and the role sought to be assumed by a county in housing not only state prisoners, but prisoners of jurisdictions outside Kentucky, is not provided for by statute and is not a function necessary for operation of the county; accordingly, the county may not lawfully lease and operate a 336 bed detention center or prison for such purpose; such action is not necessary for operation of the county and handling the types of prisoners envisioned under this project is “otherwise provided for” by statute and the Kentucky Constitution. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 90-115</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes place the general responsibility for transporting prisoners with the sheriff, with the fiscal court being responsible for providing funding for such responsibility through the jail budget. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-47</cite>.

       The maximum amount a county could charge a city for keeping city prisoners in the county jail is $1.75 per day for keeping and dieting a prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 60-761</cite>.

       The $0.75 charge which can be levied by the county against the city for imprisoning and releasing a prisoner is not a daily fee. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 60-761</cite>.

      <p>
       Where a prisoner is confined in the county jail for a breach of the by-laws or ordinances of a city, the city must pay the jailer fees, regardless of whether or not a fine was a part of the authorized penalties. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 68-144</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not the city pays for the dieting fees of city prisoners lodged in the county jail hinges on whether or not the police court has jurisdiction of the offense, such that, under applicable statutes, any fine imposed upon conviction would be payable to the city. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 68-144</cite>.

      </p>

       Where an indigent was found guilty of an offense in the city police court and sent to the county jail, although the city would be responsible for paying the dieting fees for the prisoner, it would not be responsible for his medical bills when it became necessary to hospitalize him. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-66</cite>.

       Where a city uses the county jail, the police court could recommend in a document separate from the judgment that a particular city prisoner not be allowed to be a trusty but the ultimate decision must be made by the county court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-481</cite>.

       Since this section deals with the use of the county jail by the United States and any city, it appears that the county judge has no authority to legislate in terms of prisoners to be received by the jailer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-529</cite>.

       The county judge has no authority under this section to set charges for keeping prisoners as this is a legislative matter covered by <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.150" target="_blank">KRS 64.150</a></cite> (repealed) which sets forth various jailers’ fees. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-529</cite>.

       When an indigent prisoner is held in a county jail for a city, the county of his residence has the primary responsibility for paying the jail’s diet fees but the city of his residence is jointly responsible. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-51</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The medical and drug bills of a city prisoner confined in the county jail should be paid by him if he is not indigent; if he is indigent the county of his residence is primarily responsible for such bills, although the city of his residence has joint responsibility therefor, and the city and county should agree on an equitable basis of shared payment. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-51</cite>.

       Where persons arrested by city authorities are incarcerated in the county jail under the authority of this section, their boarding bills, pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.150" target="_blank">KRS 64.150</a></cite> (repealed), are paid by the state if they are charged with a felony, by the county if they are charged with a misdemeanor and by the city if they are charged with a breach of a city ordinance. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 75-291</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city is authorized by statute to commit its prisoners to the county jail by paying the statutory fees allowable to the jailer for keeping and dieting such prisoners and the county fiscal court cannot legally refuse to accept city prisoners lawfully committed to the county jail when the city pays the prescribed statutory fees to the jailer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-362</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When requested to do so by proper city officials, a county jailer must accept a city prisoner, provided there is sufficient space in the jail at the time to accommodate him and provided the dieting fees are paid as required under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.150" target="_blank">KRS 64.150</a></cite> (repealed). <cite class="OAG"> OAG 76-536</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county, through its fiscal court, cannot require a city to pay a jail maintenance fee to the county, which is in addition to the dieting fee allowed the county jailer under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.150" target="_blank">KRS 64.150</a></cite> (repealed), in connection with the confinement in the county jail of those persons who have been charged with or convicted of violating a city ordinance; maintenance of the county jail is a required county function and persons charged with or convicted of violations of city ordinances may be confined in the county jail so long as the jailer’s fees under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.150" target="_blank">KRS 64.150</a></cite> (repealed) are paid. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-463</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the absence of a statute authorizing a fiscal court to impose an administrative fee for booking upon a municipality or arrestee, and the statutory duty imposed upon the jailer to receive and keep in jail all persons lawfully committed to the jail until they are lawfully discharged, a fiscal court cannot lawfully impose a general administrative fee on a municipality or arrestee for booking in a county jail. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 94-56</cite>.

       <p>
        This section pertains only to internal management of jails and does not authorize an order of court prohibiting members of the lay public from talking to prisoners. Henry v. Wilson, 249 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 589</cite>, 61 S.W.2d 305, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 581</cite> (Ky. 1933).

       <p>
        A county fiscal court has no mandatory duty to provide a jail facility within its boundaries; counties may confine their prisoners in facilities outside their territories. Commonwealth v. Carroll County Fiscal Court, 633 S.W.2d 720, 1982 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 216</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1982).

       </h5>
       <p>
        While it is readily understandable why for financial reasons county government should be permitted to make the best use possible of vacant, available jail space, this permissive use is necessarily secondary to the duties and responsibilities imposed by <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.025" target="_self">KRS 441.025</a></cite> and this section to “provide for the incarceration of prisoners,” including “rules for the government and cleanliness of the county jail and the comfort and treatment of prisoners.” Lexington-Fayette Urban County Detention Center v. Crockett, 786 S.W.2d 869, 1990 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 16</cite> (Ky. 1990).

       </h5>
       <p>
        State law contemplates that the authority to promulgate policies for the care of prisoners is not vested in the jailer, but in the fiscal court. Johnson v. Hardin County, 908 F.2d 1280, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 12163 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1990</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        While this section provides that the jailer “shall have the custody, rule and charge of the jail in his county and of all persons in the jail,” this provision does not establish the jailer as the final authority over the subject matter of medical care. Other provisions of the code suggest that it is the fiscal court of the county that establishes policy and the jailer who carries out these policies. Johnson v. Hardin County, 908 F.2d 1280, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 12163 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 1990</cite>).

        Where the county jailer was willing to provide information concerning the period of confinement for an inmate transferred to a hospital for treatment, there was no real dispute between the parties and mandamus was not appropriate as a means to dictate which party should physically write such information on a form. Appalachian Reg'l Healthcare, Inc. v. County of Harlan, 2001 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 56</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 27, 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        A county jailer was responsible for taking the necessary steps to seek indigency determinations for inmates transferred to a hospital for medical care. Appalachian Reg'l Healthcare, Inc. v. County of Harlan, 2001 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 56</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 27, 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of mandamus was to be issued requiring a county jailer to complete a statutory mandate and to take the necessary steps, including assisting inmates in the necessary paperwork, to ensure that an indigency determination was made for inmates in his county who required medical attention. County of Harlan v. Appalachian Reg'l Healthcare, Inc., 85 S.W.3d 607, 2002 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 188</cite> (Ky. 2002).

        Pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.045ol13" target="_self">KRS 441.045(3)</a></cite>, the county jails were responsible for the costs of providing psychotropic medications to indigent inmates in the jail, not the Commonwealth; under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.047ol11" target="_self">KRS 441.047(1)</a></cite>, the Commonwealth was responsible for costs associated with state-supported or state-operated psychiatric facilities.

        Although there was no express language in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.045" target="_self">KRS 441.045</a></cite> creating a waiver of sovereign immunity on financial claims against a metro government for medical care of inmates, the trial court should have addressed a hospital’s motion for declaratory judgment on the merits, as it related to the constitutionality of the metro government’s actions under the Fifth Amendment. Jewish Hosp. Healthcare Servs. v. Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Gov't, 270 S.W.3d 904, 2008 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 362</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2008).

        Where an inmate working as part of a work program was injured and sued the county and the jailers, since the record established that the acts of the defendants complained of were performed within the scope of their discretionary authority, and there being no evidence offered from which reasonable jurors could conclude that any of the acts complained of were performed in “bad faith,” the defendants are entitled to the protection of qualified official immunity.

        Where a pretrial detainee died in a jail cell during the course of alcohol withdrawal, plaintiffs did not establish negligence per se against deputy jailers, because a statutory violation of any regulation for the comfort and treatment of prisoners required purposeful or intentional conduct, and the record did not support the determination that each of them admitted a failure to follow the emergency medical services policy.

       Unless the county court prohibits it, the county jailer may censor incoming mail to inmates and divulge information contained therein to the appropriate officials if there is a mutual legitimate interest to be served by divulging the contents. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 65-475</cite>.
      </p>

       Jails of a second-class city and the county can be combined. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 67-64</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county judge, without any approval of the fiscal court, has authority to prescribe rules for government or management, and cleanliness of the county jail and the comfort and treatment of prisoners. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-127</cite>, 74-529.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section only pertains to the internal management of the jail, and rules issued thereunder are only administrative orders. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-127</cite>, 74-529.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a city uses the county jail, the police court could recommend in a document separate from the judgment that a particular city prisoner not be allowed to be a trusty but the ultimate decision must be made by the county court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-481</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a city uses the county jail the ultimate authority in prescribing rules governing the designation of prisoners in the county jail as trusties is vested in the county court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 71-481</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A rule prescribed by a county judge is of an administrative nature and relates to internal management and, although restrictive, is not arbitrary where it provides that prisoners received by the jailer shall be relieved of all belts, suspenders and shoe laces, shall deposit valuables with the jailer to be kept separately and shall not have a radio, television or any other item except one change of clothing and two (2) magazines or books in his area of confinement. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-529</cite>, 74-562.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rules of a county judge may deal with the place in a jail where visitations can be held but rules restricting visiting hours and telephone calls to certain days and hours are not authorized considering the jailer has custody of prisoners and may in his reasonable discretion permit or not permit visitors or calls. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 74-529</cite>, 74-562.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the county governing body can adopt rules concerning the “inside” management of the jail, the jail is not to be operated jointly by the county jailer and the county governing body; the county governing body must remain within the intended boundaries of its authority so the jailer can exercise his responsibilities and authority. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-73</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The terms “medical care” and “physician” do not include the practice of dentistry; therefore even if oral surgery was necessary and could not be postponed until after confinement without hazard, this section simply does not include the practice of dentistry and the certificate of a medical doctor that such oral surgery could not be postponed would be of no efficacy, since his statement of necessity would refer to dental practice, not medical practice. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-356</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Implicit in this section is the concept that the jailer is that instrument of government which must get the prisoner to proper medical authorities and facilities. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-455</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county judge/executive has no authority to enforce the jail rules under this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-587</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The District Court, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc24As24A.110" target="_blank">KRS 24A.110</a></cite>, has exclusive jurisdiction of a violation of jail rules. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-587</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this section is silent as to the matter of separate offenses, and since on its face it seems designed to prohibit a continuing course of conduct, where such conduct is uninterrupted by legal process, the defendant may be charged with only one offense covering a period of time up to the day the legal process is issued. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-587</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an inspection of the jail reveals willful violations of the published rules, a violation would exist as to each separate offense, carrying a fine in District Court of up to $250. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-587</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “psychological testing, evaluation or care” includes only such psychological testing, evaluation or care actually conducted by a person who is not a licensed medical doctor. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 79-642</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the county judge/executive conducts the inspections of the jail, he would be primarily responsible for making a complaint against the jailer and his deputies for violations of the rules; the other members of the fiscal court would have that responsibility where the county judge/executive fails to seek appropriate enforcement action. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-154</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of fiscal court to adopt rules for the jail operation could possibly subject the members of that body to an indictment for willful neglect in the discharge of their duties, as prescribed in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc61s61.170" target="_blank">KRS 61.170</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-154</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court is responsible for the maintenance of the jail, as a county building, and for establishing rules, under this section, for the internal management of the jail; the jailer is the immediate custodian of the jail and its prisoners, but the jailer’s management of the jail is designed to be regulated and supervised through the regulations of the fiscal court and the monthly inspections of the jail by the county judge/executive. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-154</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a prisoner is transferred from a county jail to a hospital for treatment, the sheriff in the county where the trial is to be held would have to transport him; assuming that the prisoner is in the county jail and is an indigent, this section provides only for medical care costs and, since there is nothing in the entire section that suggests that medical care includes transportation costs, the sheriff would have to bill through a documented claim, the county for reimbursement of actual and necessary expenses incurred in the transportation of the prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-434</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inasmuch as the county jailer has the custody of the prisoners, the jailer must treat the prisoners humanely, which includes the direct and immediate responsibility for seeing to it that the prisoners get proper medical attention, thus the county jailer has the immediate responsibility for transporting sick prisoners to the hospital and back. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-607</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a county generally has responsibility only for those indigents who actually reside in that county, the medical care costs for those indigent prisoners who are residents of another county or state would also have to be borne by the county of incarceration as a necessary cost in the operation of the jail pursuant to subsection (2)(b)(now (2)(d)) of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.080" target="_blank">KRS 67.080</a></cite>, subsection (3)(p) of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.083" target="_blank">KRS 67.083</a></cite>, and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.130" target="_blank">KRS 67.130</a></cite>, subject to the payment of medical care for those indigent prisoners with nonpostponable life or health threatening problems by the county, state or federal governmental unit, whose law has been violated, as provided in this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-213</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the items of transportation and security costs incurred in transporting an indigent prisoner who is ill to medical facilities are not covered in this section, the incarcerating county must pay such expenses and, where the county is unable to pay such expenses, they may be paid out of the jailer’s fees, if available. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-213</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc44s44.020" target="_blank">KRS 44.020</a></cite> does not apply to this section, under which the state must pay for nonpostponable medical care extended to an indigent prisoner in the county jail, provided the prisoner is charged with violating a state statute and is not a prisoner of the United States. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-336</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A statement in the 1982 budget bill, Ch. 395, that payment should be provided only for emergency medical services for indigents which cannot be postponed until after the period of confinement without hazard to the needy person, and the phrase “extensive medical care,” should be disregarded as not being a constitutional part of the budget bill, as the statement was in no way necessary or germane to the budget or appropriations concept, but merely attempted to deal with legislative intent in connection with qualifying applications of the money appropriated for indigent prisoners in county jails. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-322</cite>.

       The medical care afforded the indigent does not extend to convalescent care, where such convalescent care is not necessary to preserve the health or life of the prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-322</cite>.

       Where a county houses other counties’ inmates pursuant to contract, the administration of the county’s function with regard to medical care for indigents would rest with the holding county for indigent prisoners of the contracting counties. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-334</cite>.

       Nothing in KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc70" target="_blank">Chapter 70</a></cite> requires the sheriff to be a security guard for jail prisoners taken to the hospital. The responsibility for taking such prisoners to the hospital or to the doctor and guarding them is placed upon the jailer and his staff. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-403</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a prisoner was working for the county road crew at the time he was injured made no difference as to the responsibility of the county for his medical expenses. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-225</cite>; <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-289</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fiscal court, in a county where a prisoner was injured while working on the county road crew, must pay statutorily required portion of the total hospital bill under the express language of this section and the responsibility rested with the county, even though county money for that purpose was not available; the county would be subject to a lawsuit by the hospital in the event the amount was not paid. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-225</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city of the fourth class (like all cities) has no responsibility for providing a jail; in addition, there appear to be no statutes requiring such city to contribute to or pay for the incarceration, housing, transportation, feeding and medical treatment of persons arrested by its officers. However, where the person arrested is charged with violating a city ordinance, the city, if the prisoner is determined to be indigent under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.04.html#tIVc31s31.120" target="_blank">KRS 31.120</a></cite>, would be responsible for paying nonpostponable medical attention cost involving such prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-299</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true that subsection (1) of this section, when viewed in isolation, is permissive as relates to the fiscal court’s prescribing rules pertaining to the internal management of the county jail, the corrections cabinet’s (now Department of Corrections) regulation requiring the fiscal court to adopt a manual of policy and administration is reasonably consistent with this chapter. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-378</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.011ol11a" target="_self">KRS 441.011(1)(a)</a></cite>(3) (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.055ol11a" target="_self">KRS 441.055(1)(a)</a></cite>(3)), when considered together with the totality of the jailer’s responsibilities in the operation of the jail, authorizes the corrections cabinet (now Department of Corrections) to require, as it did in 501 KAR 3:020, that county jailers maintain an operations manual covering jail operations and administration; this statutory authority and construction logically and reasonably emerges from the four corners of the 1982 jail legislation. If the jailers are to reasonably conform to the operational responsibilities placed upon the jailers in this legislation, the operations manual will represent an organizational and detailed tool to accomplish the legislative purpose of providing an orderly and effective jail system in Kentucky. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-378</cite>.

       Psychological or psychiatrical evaluations do not fall under the term “psychological care” as used in subsection (3) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-223</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an indigent prisoner is brought to a county jail, and assuming that the particular county has the responsibility under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.025" target="_self">KRS 441.025</a></cite> to incarcerate the prisoner, the fiscal court of that county, through its jail budget, has to bear the cost of providing necessary medical, dental or psychological care for such prisoner, subject to the applicable exceptions under subsections (4) and (5) of this section. The fact that the jailer refused to incarcerate the prisoner when first brought in on the ground that medical attention was deemed necessary in no way militates against the responsibility of that particular county for paying the prisoner’s medical costs. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-256</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only after a prisoner becomes lodged in a county jail does the county potentially become liable for the costs of emergency medical treatment for the prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-54</cite>, withdrawing <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-122</cite>, and modifying <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-256</cite>.

       Jailer has the authority to photograph prisoners, without their consent, legally entrusted to his custody for the purpose of identification and in order to promote the safe-keeping and security of the jail. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-306</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       County liability for necessary medical care of an indigent person, who is hospitalized while a prisoner of the county jail, ceases when an individual’s status as a prisoner ceases. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-77</cite>.

       2007 Ky. Acts ch. 128, §
    5, provides:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) The Secretary of the Justice Cabinet shall have the authority to declare a state of extraordinary circumstances upon a finding that the appropriations to the Department of Corrections for the provision of medical care of prisoners in county jails pursuant to Sections 2, 3, and 4 of this Act, for the provision of drugs, medications, and similar items for prisoners in county jails pursuant to Sections 2, 3, and 4 of this Act and
    <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.045" target="_self">KRS 441.045</a></cite>, and for the medical care of county jail prisoners who are transferred to the Department of Corrections pursuant to Section 2 of this Act, are insufficient to pay the expenses authorized by either section. Upon certification and notwithstanding 2006 Ky. Acts <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.21.html#tXXIc252" target="_blank">Chapter 252</a></cite>, Part III, General Provisions, 5. Appropriations Expenditure Purpose and Transfer Restrictions, the secretary shall be authorized to transfer general fund moneys, restricted funds, or federal funds, with the approval of the State Budget Director, to the extent funds are available and not otherwise obligated to carry out the provisions of KRS Chapters 196, 197, and 441 in the 2006-2008 fiscal biennium from other budget units within the cabinet to the Department of Corrections to address the immediate needs of a program authorized by Section 2, 3, or 4 and
    <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.045" target="_self">KRS 441.045</a></cite> of this Act. The transfer of any funds pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions and notification requirements of
    <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.06.html#tVIc48s48.630" target="_blank">KRS 48.630</a></cite>. Moneys transferred pursuant to this paragraph shall be placed in a trust and agency account to be used for the purpose set forth in this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) If, after transferring funds within the cabinet, the secretary finds that extraordinary needs relating to medical care of county jail prisoners still exist, the secretary may then request approval from the Governor for any amount of expenditures not covered by funds transferred from other agencies within the cabinet, not to exceed $1,500,000, for catastrophic, medical care, and medical care pursuant to Section 2 of this Act and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.045" target="_self">KRS 441.045</a></cite> to request that expenditures be deemed a necessary governmental expense. Upon approval by the Governor, funds not to exceed $1,500,000 shall be transferred from the General Fund Surplus (KRS 48.700) or the Budget Reserve Trust Fund Account (KRS 84.705). These funds shall be transferred only upon certification of need by the Secretary of the Justice Cabinet to the Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet and upon approval by the Governor. Moneys appropriated pursuant to this paragraph shall be placed in a trust and agency account to be used for the purpose set forth in this paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) If, after transferring funds within the cabinet, the secretary finds that extraordinary needs relating to medical care of county jail prisoners relating to the Department of Corrections medical, dental, and psychological care access plan pursuant to Section 4 of this Act still exist, the secretary may then request approval from the Governor for any amount of expenditures not covered by funds transferred from other agencies within the cabinet, not to exceed $1,000,000, and to request that expenditures be deemed a necessary governmental expense. Upon approval by the Governor, funds not to exceed $1,000,000 shall be transferred from the General Fund Surplus (KRS 48.700) or the Budget Reserve Trust Fund Account (KRS 84.705). These funds shall be transferred only upon certification of need by the Secretary of the Justice Cabinet to the Secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet and upon approval by the Governor. Moneys appropriated pursuant to this paragraph shall be placed in a trust and agency account to be used for the purpose set forth in this paragraph.

       <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.006" target="_self">KRS 441.006</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.025" target="_self">KRS 441.025</a></cite>) implicitly gives the fiscal court the authority to determine the prisoner capacity of the local jail in order to intelligently plan for the incarceration of all prisoners subject to the local courts. The number of prisoners would be subject to jail standards, emerging from the jail standards commission pursuant to this section, as adopted by the Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections), and other statutory requirements relating to detention facilities. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-421</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the fiscal court’s statutory duty of meeting the minimal jailer salary and other standards, the fiscal court is required to, in consultation with the jailer, adopt an operating budget for the jail. Where a jailer has good reason to believe that a fiscal court has acted arbitrarily in establishing the operating budget for the jail, and the jail operation has no more money for that year, he may seek redress in the circuit court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-498</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true that <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.010ol11" target="_self">KRS 441.010(1)</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.045" target="_self">KRS 441.045</a></cite>), when viewed in isolation, is permissive as relates to the fiscal court’s prescribing rules pertaining to the internal management of the county jail, the corrections cabinet’s (now Department of Corrections) regulation requiring the fiscal court to adopt a manual of policy and administration is reasonably consistent with this chapter. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-378</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (1)(a)(3) of this section, when considered together with the totality of the jailer’s responsibilities in the operation of the jail, authorizes the corrections cabinet (now Department of Corrections) to require, as it did in 501 KAR 3:020, that county jailers maintain an operations manual covering jail operations and administration; this statutory authority and construction logically and reasonably emerges from the four (4) corners of the 1982 jail legislation. If the jailers are to reasonably conform to the operational responsibilities placed upon the jailers in this legislation, the operations manual will represent an organizational and detailed tool to accomplish the legislative purpose of providing an orderly and effective jail system in Kentucky. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-378</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jailer has the authority to photograph prisoners, without their consent, legally entrusted to his custody for the purpose of identification and in order to promote the safe-keeping and security of the jail. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-306</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judges of the judicial system would have to observe any existing jail policy and procedure, issued by the Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections) or the county jailer, relating to visitation of county jail inmates; however, where a judge of a court, in exercising the court’s sound judicial discretion, believes that justice in a particular case would require the court’s imposing some special rule as to visitation of a particular prisoner whose case is pending before that court, the court may so impose the special rule. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-331</cite>.

       For the purpose of raising the level of competence of jailers and jail personnel, the department shall maintain a jail staff training program to provide training for jailers and jail personnel consistent with the standards promulgated pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.055" target="_self">KRS 441.055</a></cite> and shall keep records of jailers and jail personnel who satisfactorily complete basic and annual continuing education.

A curriculum advisory committee composed of jailers, their representatives, and recognized professionals in the field of jail administration shall advise the department concerning the training needs of jailers and jail personnel. The jail staff training program shall be directed and staffed by knowledgeable persons who have sufficient experience, training, and education in jail operations. The department shall not charge a fee for training jailers, their deputies, or jailers-elect.

      <li id="tXLc441s441.115ol12">
       Beginning in August, 1982, each jailer shall receive an expense allowance to help defray the costs of his participation in the jail staff training program. The expense allowance shall be in the amount of three hundred dollars ($300) per month payable out of the State Treasury. Expense allowance payments shall be discontinued if the jailer fails to satisfactorily complete annual continuing training. Expense allowance payments shall be resumed following a discontinuance for failure to satisfactorily complete basic or annual training only upon the jailer’s satisfactory completion of the training.

This provision shall not apply if the jailer-elect is ill and unable to complete the training before taking office. In such cases, the jailer-elect shall successfully complete a new jailer training program during his first year in office in order to receive the expense allowance.

      <p>
       The first payment for an expense allowance provided for in subsection (2) of this section was for the month of August, 1982 and this is true even though § 53 of Acts 1982, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.32.html#tXXXIIc385" target="_blank">Chapter 385</a></cite> provided that the section should become effective July 1, 1982. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-585</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section places upon the Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections) the responsibility for maintaining a local corrections training program for jailers and jail staff, and the expense allowance to jailers relates exclusively to local corrections training programs maintained by the Corrections Cabinet; however, there is nothing prohibiting any jailer’s pursuing additional instruction for jailers provided by a non-Kentucky source. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-273</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections) can require the jailers who are receiving training to bear a portion of the cost by using their training allowance; in this way the express purpose of the allowance is being subserved. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-334</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event the jailer takes the training but refuses or fails to pay the cost charged against him, the Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections) can ask the Finance and Administration Cabinet to take steps to stop the monthly training allowance, to the extent of training charges owed to Corrections, until the training charge is paid by the particular jailer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-334</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the jailer has taken the required training course, the Corrections Cabinet (now Department of Corrections) may legally refuse to issue the certificate of training in the event the jailer has not paid the training charge assessed against him. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-334</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The expense allowance provided for in subsection (2) of this section is not broken down so as to isolate some part of the program, such as the youth center, but rather the allowance is for the entire detention operation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-199</cite>.

       Under a contract agreement by which one county incarcerates prisoners from another county, the sending county would be reimbursed finally by the holding county based upon the formula outlined in subsections (1) and (2) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-334</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purpose of obtaining employee fringe benefits, the county is responsible for paying on behalf of jail personnel, as county employees, social security payments (KRS Ch. 61), workers’ compensation premiums (KRS Ch. 342), unemployment insurance premiums (KRS Ch. 341) and medical insurance coverage (KRS Ch. 67). <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-346</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deputies, matrons and other supporting jail personnel, as defined in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.005ol16" target="_self">KRS 441.005(6)</a></cite>, are county employees even though the state contributes financially to the operation of the jail under this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-346</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1) of this section establishes a uniform formula for the payment of the state’s contribution to each county for its incarceration of prisoners; any $5 fee earned by the jailer in making bond and collected by him in fiscal year 1980-81 was taken into account as a part of such formula calculation. Even where subsection (4) (now (5)) of this section applies, and a prior fiscal year is authorized by the secretary of finance as a basis for the formula calculation, the principle remains the same. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-477</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compensation to be paid to receiving county by sending county for the keeping of sending county’s prisoners must depend upon the mutual agreement of the two (2) fiscal courts, which agreement should involve a reasonable compensation for the detention services furnished, framed around the actual costs of furnishing such detention facilities; the cost elements could include a consideration of the original construction cost of the receiving county’s jail, the space allotted per prisoner, the cost of utilities, the present cost of replacement of the jail if it had to be rebuilt, the level of standards in terms of what would be considered adequate jail housing, the operational and salary costs relating to the jailer and his deputies, including furnishing of food. An agreement based upon the sending county’s sharing in both the operational and capital construction costs would be equitable, and would meet the fundamental fairness concept expressed in Const., § 2. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-26</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election by a county to close its jail and to contract with another county for the incarceration of prisoners, as permitted by <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.006" target="_self">KRS 441.006</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.025" target="_self">KRS 441.025</a></cite>), does not affect the state contribution provided in subsection (1) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-26</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court could transfer money from a jail budget item to a county nonjail budget item to provide for an emergency; however, such transfer would be subject to these conditions: (1) the transfer must not create an emergency for the jail; and (2) the restrictions of subsection (3) of this section must be carefully observed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-36</cite>.

        Circuit court properly dismissed the deputy jailers’ complaint against the fiscal court; alleging a violation of the Kentucky Wage and Hour Act for wages owed to them in accordance with the pay increases promised by the county jailer; because, even though the deputies’ salaries were paid from the jail budget, the deputy jailers were considered county employees, the jailer’s role was simply to direct the county treasurer to pay the deputies their wages as agreed upon by the fiscal court and had nothing to do with the determination of compensation or the discretion to adjust the compensation of the deputy jailers, the fiscal court was to fix the reasonable compensation for county employees and had never agreed to the claimed wages.

       The phrase “other county employees,” appearing in subsection (2) of this section, buttresses the concept that for general purposes of various fringe benefits, the jail employees are indeed county employees.

       The fiscal court, as the direct budgeting authority, should at the end of each calendar year retain any excess, not needed for the jail budget for that year, in the county treasury for any expenditure authorized by the county budget. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-315</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Determination of the type, kind and amount of purchases (including food, bed supplies, cleaning supplies, etc.) for the jail is a joint responsibility of the jailer and the fiscal court. The jailer is immediately responsible for the program of necessary purchases, but after consultation and approval of fiscal court, since it is the funding agency. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-344</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fixing of the jail operating budget, as an integral part of the county budget, must take into consideration an adequate estimate of number of prisoners, food, space, transportation, salaries, and all other necessary jail operating costs. The budget must meet the basic formulated jail needs, within the funding capability in terms of county financing and state or other contributions, and of course, the minimal requirements as to the jailer’s salary in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.009" target="_self">KRS 441.009</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.245" target="_self">KRS 441.245</a></cite>) must be observed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-344</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is up to the jailer to procure the necessary drivers and guards required to transport prisoners to a jail to be used under a contract with another county; this should be done by closely cooperating with the fiscal court, so that it knows precisely and in detail what is required under that jail plan. The funding of such necessary personnel clearly rests with the fiscal court under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.006" target="_self">KRS 441.006</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.025" target="_self">KRS 441.025</a></cite>) and this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-399</cite>.

       The fiscal court cannot refuse to budget funds for the salaries of the jailer’s necessary deputies and matrons. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-400</cite> (modifying <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-155</cite>, 80-319 and related opinions).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section places the responsibility upon fiscal courts of adopting an operating budget for the jail, involving the expenditure of all state, county and other funds for jail operations and, in that budget, the responsibility to fund properly the salaries of the jailer and his deputies and matrons is clearly included. The “operating budget for the jail” is literally expressed and includes the entire and necessary jail operation; the statute is unambiguous and should be literally construed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-400</cite> (modifying <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-155</cite>, 80-319 and related opinions).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the local jail is at its capacity and the fiscal court contracts with another county or a city to provide detention facilities for such excess, the jailer generally procures the necessary drivers and guards required to transport prisoners to the jail to be used under the contract, and this should be done by closely cooperating with the fiscal court, such that it knows precisely and in detail what is required under that jail plan; the funding of such necessary personnel clearly rests with the fiscal court under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.006" target="_self">KRS 441.006</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.025" target="_self">KRS 441.025</a></cite>) and this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-421</cite>.

       <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.300" target="_blank">KRS 68.300</a></cite> voiding any claim or appropriation in excess of budget appropriations applies to the jail budget part of the county budget. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-424</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since under this section where the jailer’s expenditures are within authorized budget categories, the county treasurer must prepare the checks, sign them and see to it that the payees receive the checks, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.020ol11" target="_blank">KRS 68.020(1)</a></cite>, which requires the county treasurer to disburse county funds as authorized by fiscal court and to cosign county checks with the county judge/executive, does not apply. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-424</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court is not responsible for any overspending of the jail funds, since it has no supervising or approving role; however, the county treasurer would be directly held responsible for any such overspending; the jailer, of course, has a direct responsibility in seeing to it that he stays precisely within his budgeted funds. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-424</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the fiscal court’s statutory duty of meeting the minimal jailer salary and other standards, the fiscal court is required to, in consultation with the jailer, adopt an operating budget for the jail. Where a jailer has good reason to believe that a fiscal court has acted arbitrarily in establishing the operating budget for the jail, and the jail operation has no more money for that year, he may seek redress in the Circuit Court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-498</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The budgeting for reimbursement of the jailer for litigational expenses must relate to the county budget proper, but not as relates to the “operating budget for the jail.” There is simply no statute authorizing it to be a part of a “jail budget.” <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-509</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc337s337.285" target="_blank">KRS 337.285</a></cite> (time and a half) is properly applied (extra time is necessary), then if the “jail budget” part of the county budget does not contain the money to pay for such overtime, the fiscal court is responsible for paying it, since the fiscal court has the overall duty of maintaining a county jail operation regardless of whether it admits an employer-employee relationship or not. In such situation the “employer” is still the jailer under KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc337" target="_blank">Chapter 337</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-625</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the enactment of Acts 1982, ch. 385, where time in excess of 40 hours was authorized by the jailer, the time and one half payment was a claim against the jailer’s fees; where he had no fees available, the county treasurer, where a properly budgeted sum was available, was answerable to such payment for overtime, under the concept that the county jail was a county institution, even though the jailer was immediately in charge of the jail and the fiscal court was ultimately or derivatively responsible for the effective operation of that county institution. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-626</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       On and after July 1, 1982, the effective date of Acts 1982, ch. 385, the county treasurer at the discretion of the jailer is responsible for payment of overtime to the deputy jailer and matron out of the jail budget part of the county budget, assuming that the overtime is necessary and that such an expenditure is within an authorized budget category, as covered in subsection (2) of this section; if not, then the fiscal court will have to pay it out where such funds are available. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-626</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jailer should authorize work in excess of 40 hours (per week) only where necessary; where it is shown that a jailer is guilty of mismanagement in authorizing an “overtime situation,” he would be personally liable and liable on his bond for the payment of the overtime to the deputy or matron, and the claim would not be payable from the jail fund or county treasury. Where the overtime is necessary, the claim for overtime must be paid from the jail fund, or from the county treasury generally, where there are no jail budget funds to pay it. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-626</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this section, as relates to the jail budget, is to make use of the jailer’s input on the jail part of the county budget. Thus, the fiscal court, in preparing a budget amendment to provide for the expenditure of unanticipated revenue, should consult with the jailer, as strongly implied in this section; it would be illogical to say that the jailer must be consulted in formulating the original budget, but not on an amendment. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-36</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unanticipated revenues received by the county could displace (free up) county tax revenue originally budgeted for jail purposes, provided that the adequate and efficient operation of the jail would in no way be lessened or impaired. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-36</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court could transfer money from a jail budget item to a county nonjail budget item to provide for an emergency; however, such transfer would be subject to these conditions: (1) the transfer must not create an emergency for the jail; and (2) the restrictions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.007ol13" target="_self">KRS 441.007(3)</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.206ol13" target="_self">KRS 441.206(3)</a></cite>) must be carefully observed. Also, in transferring money between jail funds under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68s68.290" target="_blank">KRS 68.290</a></cite>, the fiscal court should consult with the jailer on such transfers. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-36</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The adoption of the jail budget, as a part of the county budget, is not tantamount to setting the salaries of the jailer and his deputies; salary setting requires a separate action on the part of the fiscal court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-49</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The county treasurer, under subsection (2) of this section, is required to disburse jail operating funds (though a part of the county budget) at the discretion of the jailer and it would appear that the fiscal court or county judge/executive has no administrative control over such jail expenditures; however, the fiscal court could, in a proper case, seek mandamus or injunctive relief against him where it is alleged that the jailer is substantially exceeding his statutory authority. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-218</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court must provide the jail with proper furnishings and equipment necessary for preparation of food for jail prisoners; this is primarily a direct capital and equipment responsibility of the county, through the fiscal court. In addition, the funds for the food and necessary funds for food preparation personnel must come out of the jail budget of the county budget. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-250</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county jail had been closed and the fiscal court permitted the jailer to remain in the living quarters of the jail for the remainder of his term without paying rent, the fiscal court could legally discontinue paying his utility bills since failing to pay the jailer’s utility bill had nothing to do with reducing the jailer’s compensation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-280</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the local jail is closed and the prisoners are transported to a jail in another county, the local jailer is responsible for transporting such prisoners to and from such detention facility; however, the providing of the necessary vehicle for such transportation is the same as if the local jail were operational, that is, it is a joint responsibility of the fiscal court and jailer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-368</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc337s337.020" target="_blank">KRS 337.020</a></cite> applies to the payment of jail employees, including the jailer’s deputies, and the exception listed in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.27.html#tXXVIIc337s337.020" target="_blank">KRS 337.020</a></cite> does not apply to such county jail employees; thus, the jailer must pay the county jail employees as often as semi-monthly all salary earned to a day not more than 18 days prior to the date of that payment. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-423</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the county judge/executive nor the fiscal court has the authority to approve or disapprove an expenditure for the jail as long as the expense is included in the jail budget and sufficient funds are available. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-490</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A jailer may require his prisoners to wear some reasonable type of prisoner uniform calculated to subserve the necessary disciplinary system of the jail; such appropriate prisoner uniforms would constitute a legitimate item of expense, which may be provided for in the jail budget. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-44</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until July 13, 1984, where the jailer’s deputy assists the jailer as transportation officer, the county treasurer should disburse the compensation earned and payable to this deputy from the available budgeted “jail budget” funds; on and after July 13, 1984, the jailer’s deputy can no longer pursue that role and it is then up to the fiscal court to provide any necessary vehicles, drivers and guards for whoever is transportation officer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-179</cite>.

        1.Amount of Salary.
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section permits a jailer to receive from fiscal court as his 1982 salary that amount of personal compensation he received or paid himself in 1981 plus the adjusted change in the cost of living, under the limit provided in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.527" target="_blank">KRS 64.527</a></cite>. Nickell v. Thomas, 665 S.W.2d 927, 1984 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 453</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plain meaning of this statute mandates that a jailer’s salary remain the same from year to year, with adjustments permitted solely for changes in the consumer price index; in light of this section, a county fiscal court did not have the authority to reduce a jailer’s salary. Wallace v. King, 973 S.W.2d 485, 1998 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 59</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jailer’s salary could not be reduced during his term of office, even though the duties of the office had changed, and even though the contemplated reduction would have applied to the next term. Wallace v. King, 973 S.W.2d 485, 1998 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 59</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 1998).

       Opinions of Attorney General.
      </h4>
      <p>
       The compensation for the jailer for the 1981 calendar year is determined from his total fees actually received during that calendar year, but not to exceed the maximum rubber dollar amount of $26,058. In the absence of contrary statutory provision, it seems logical to conclude that the jailer, for 1981, may first apply his earned fees to his own compensation, and then if any fees remain, they may be applied to his deputy salaries and other expenses. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-315</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fixing of the jail operating budget, as an integral part of the county budget, must take into consideration an adequate estimate of number of prisoners, food, space, transportation, salaries, and all other necessary jail operating costs. The budget must meet the basic formulated jail needs, within the funding capability in terms of county financing and state or other contributions, and of course, the minimal requirements as to the jailer’s salary in this section must be observed. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-344</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court cannot refuse to budget funds for the salaries of the jailer’s necessary deputies and matrons. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-400</cite> (modifying <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-155</cite>, 80-319 and related opinions).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (3) of this section, in order to be consistent with the concept of annual salary, must be interpreted merely to show what a monthly breakdown in salary would be in the calendar year 1982. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-497</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where county jail was not open in 1981 or 1982, but county had a jailer who lived in the jailer’s residence, the fiscal court could consider the benefit of free rent for the jailer’s residence as income to the jailer in determining the amount of income earned by the jailer for the period from January, 1982 through June, 1982. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-497</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where county jail was not open in 1981 or 1982, but county had a jailer who lived in the jailer’s residence and was paid a salary as custodian of county property under the formula laid out in subsection (2) of this section, the jailer’s earnings in 1982 from being buildings custodian could not be used for such compensation formulation for the calendar year 1982, but the jailer could keep his custodial earnings, provided that his total compensation did not exceed the rubber dollar maximum for 1982. Moreover, his earnings as buildings custodian for the calendar year of 1981 would be his compensation for calendar year 1982, unless the $12,000 figure is greater, in which case the $12,000 would be his minimal salary for 1982. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-497</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where jail was not open in 1981 or 1982, but county had a jailer who lived in the jailer’s residence and was paid a salary as custodian of county property, the jailer could accept compensation as custodian and add that to any other compensation fixed by the fiscal court, provided the total did not exceed the rubber dollar limit for that year. But basically, the jailer can only be paid for services actually rendered. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-497</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the fiscal court’s statutory duty of meeting the minimal jailer salary and other standards, the fiscal court is required to, in consultation with the jailer, adopt an operating budget for the jail. Where a jailer has good reason to believe that a fiscal court has acted arbitrarily in establishing the operating budget for the jail, and the jail operation has no more money for that year, he may seek redress in the Circuit Court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-498</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The adoption of the jail budget, as a part of the county budget, is not tantamount to setting the salaries of the jailer and his deputies; salary setting requires a separate action on the part of the fiscal court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-49</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the jailer’s salary is properly set under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.530" target="_blank">KRS 64.530</a></cite>, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.527" target="_blank">64.527,</a></cite> and this section, it cannot be reduced, since that would be a “change in compensation,” which is prohibited by Const., §§ 161 and 235; an upward adjustment during the term of a jailer’s salary not to exceed the rubber dollar level, is not a change in compensation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-49</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jailer must be personally responsible for purchasing, out of his personal funds, the food requirements for him and his family. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-250</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county has a holdover jail, the fiscal court should establish a reasonable salary for the jailer, based upon his range of functions, as described in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.510" target="_self">KRS 441.510</a></cite>, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.050" target="_blank">71.050,</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.130" target="_blank">67.130,</a></cite> and actual performance thereof. However, such salary should not exceed the $12,000.00 described in subsection (5) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-6</cite>. (Opinion prior to 1998 amendment.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes do not authorize a salary for services of a jailer incident to preparation for opening of a jail. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-47</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes do not provide for supplementing or increasing the salary of a jailer, in a county that does not have a jail, to compensate the jailer for services rendered in preparing for the opening of a jail. In the absence of statutory authority for enhancing the salary of a jailer for such purpose, and in view of the specific maximum imposed by statute on the salary of a jailer in a county that does not have a jail, and in which the jailer does not transport prisoners, a jailer is limited to a maximum salary of $12,000, until such time as the jail is opened. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-47</cite>.

Sickles v. Campbell County, 439 F. Supp. 2d 751, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51715 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2006</cite>), aff'd, 501 F.3d 726, 2007 FED App. 0361P, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 21163 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2007</cite>).

       <p>
        Language of the statute is unambiguous, and seems clearly intended to provide a means for county jails to automatically deduct required fees when the inmate has the funds available; required fees may automatically be deducted from the prisoners' property or inmate canteen accounts, and if a negative balance is created, subsection (1) permits a sentencing court to order a prisoner to reimburse the jail. Cole v. Warren Cnty., 495 S.W.3d 712, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 157</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).

       <p>
        Kentucky counties were entitled to summary judgment in consolidated 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 actions by inmates alleging violations of their U.S. Const. amend. XIV due process rights in the imposition of jail fees under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.265" target="_self">KRS 441.265</a></cite>; the post-deprivation grievance procedures provided pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.265" target="_self">KRS 441.265</a></cite>(2)(b) were adequate to protect the inmates’
    due process rights. Sickles v. Campbell County, 439 F. Supp. 2d 751, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51715 (E.D. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2006</cite>), aff'd, 501 F.3d 726, 2007 FED App. 0361P, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 21163 (6th Cir. <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 2007</cite>).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prisoners' due process rights were not violated because the prisoners were never actually deprived of their property; the prisoners' funds were deposited into their bank account for safe keeping, and with the exception of the jail legally withdrawing required fees, the prisoners had access to those funds while in jail and upon release. Cole v. Warren Cnty., 495 S.W.3d 712, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 157</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).

       </h5>
       <p>
        County jail's practice of confiscating prisoner's checks and depositing the funds into their bank accounts for use of the costs associated with their confinement did not violate the statute because when subsection (1) was read in conjunction with subsection (6), the statute unambiguously permitted the exact practice the jail used. Cole v. Warren Cnty., 495 S.W.3d 712, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 157</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bank was not liable to prisoners for conversion because it did not make payment with respect to an instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument; a county jail became a nonholder in possession of the instrument and had the rights of a holder when it lawfully confiscated prisoners' checks, and thus, the jail was entitled to enforce the confiscated checks pursuant to the statute. Cole v. Warren Cnty., 495 S.W.3d 712, 2015 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 157</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. 2015).

       <p>
        In a drug case, the standard for the payment of jail fees set forth in the statute for misdemeanors did not apply because defendant was convicted of a felony. Hunt v. Commonwealth, 2016 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 65</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2016).

       </h5>
       <p>
        This statute states that a county or jail may adopt a policy that sets out specifically how fees will be reimbursed, but it does not require a jail or county to have such a policy in place. Therefore, a policy did not have to be in place in order for a court to require a prisoner or defendant to reimburse jail fees. Hunt v. Commonwealth, 2016 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 65</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2016).

        6.Resources.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court is not permitted to consider any resources of a defendant's family when it determines whether the defendant is required to reimburse jail fees. However, there was no good cause to waive the fees because the record did not reflect that the trial court considered the family resources, and the trial court determined that defendant would have been able to work while incarcerated and upon release to reimburse the jail fees. Hunt v. Commonwealth, 2016 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. App. LEXIS 65</cite> (Ky. Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2016).

      <p>
       A sheriff can only receive compensation or fees for his public services as provided by statute; assuming the proper budgeting of the costs for transporting prisoners in the jail budget part of the county budget, pursuant to KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc68" target="_blank">Chapter 68</a></cite>, the sheriff’s actual costs of transportation should be paid out of the budgeted fund upon presentation of proper documentation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-330</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subject to proper budgeting and availability of funds, a sheriff’s office may obtain reimbursement from either the fiscal court or the county jail budget for costs associated with transporting, and standing by with, county prisoners in connection with court ordered psychological evaluations. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-88</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory duty imposed upon the sheriff to transport prisoners (except in an urban county, and as otherwise provided), transcends availability of funds. If a county does not have resources to pay for prisoner transportation, the sheriff’s office must nonetheless carry out such responsibility as part of the statutorily assigned duties of the office. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-88</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes place the general responsibility for transporting prisoners with the sheriff, with the fiscal court being responsible for providing funding for such responsibility through the jail budget. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-47</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is up to the fiscal court to adopt a transportation plan for transportation of prisoners as necessary; however, if the fiscal court does not adopt a transportation plan then transportation of prisoners will be provided for as provided in subsection (1) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 94-10</cite>.

       In urban-counties the jailer bears the duty of transportation and is entitled to charge the $6 fee if he performs the service, and the sheriff is entitled to collect the fee if he does the transporting in lieu of the jailer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-23</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The duty of transporting prisoners from one detention facility to another, in a different county, rests upon the sheriff of the county where the trial will be held, unless the circumstances fall within one of the exceptions established by subsections (1)(a) and (b) or former provisions (2)(a) and (b) of this section, and since there is no statutory provision for the sheriff’s compensation for transporting misdemeanants from one county to another, the sheriff must perform this duty without compensation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-342</cite>. (Opinion prior to the 1996 amenmdent.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If a prisoner is transferred from a county jail to a hospital for treatment, the sheriff in the county where the trial is to be held would have to transport him; assuming that the prisoner is in the county jail and is an indigent under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.010" target="_self">KRS 441.010</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.045" target="_self">KRS 441.045</a></cite>), that section provides only for medical care costs and since there is nothing in the entire section that suggests that medical care includes transportation costs, the sheriff would have to bill, through a documented claim, the county for reimbursement of actual and necessary expenses incurred in the transportation of the prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-434</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sheriff is required to transport prisoners placed in his custody as far as is necessary to execute the orders of the courts as to the prisoners’ place of confinement. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-482</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff has a duty to obey all orders of the courts of justice, and to execute the sentence of the court and this duty is absolute; if the sheriff is charged to take custody of a prisoner by a judge he must do so, even when both he and the judge are aware that no facilities are available for housing the prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-482</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An ordinance which provides that where a county jail prisoner must be taken to the hospital and guards must be provided for that purpose, the sheriff must provide the guards from among his deputies, is invalid, since the immediate responsibility for the hospital guards attaches to the jailer under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.020" target="_blank">KRS 71.020</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.040" target="_blank">KRS 71.040</a></cite> and where the jailer is unable to furnish guards from his staff he must call upon the fiscal court to provide them rather than the sheriff, whose responsibility for transporting prisoners under this section relates only to transporting them to and from detention facilities. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-35</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the court orders the sheriff to transport a mental patient to a mental health facility for examination and treatment pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc202As202A.100" target="_blank">KRS 202A.100</a></cite> (repealed), the sheriff must assume that responsibility, but where a peace officer under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.17.html#tXVIIc202As202A.040" target="_blank">KRS 202A.040</a></cite> (repealed) arrests a mentally ill person, he must take the person to a physician or hospital, and, under those circumstances, the peace officer can call on the sheriff for help in such transportation, pursuant to this section; thus, at this point the sheriff is responsible for transporting the mentally ill person from the hospital where he is being held to the local court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 81-148</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether the police, the jailer or the sheriff does the transporting, there is no provision in this section for a fee for the service of transporting the accused from the jail or the detention facility to the court and, thus, the sheriff cannot charge or collect any fee for rendering this particular service. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-111</cite>. (Opinion prior to the 1982 amendment to this section).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not cover the furnishing of security guards for a prisoner after admission to a hospital. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-403</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the local jail is at its capacity and the fiscal court contracts with another county or a city to provide detention facilities for such excess, the jailer generally procures the necessary drivers and guards required to transport prisoners to the jail to be used under the contract, and this should be done by closely cooperating with the fiscal court, such that it knows precisely and in detail what is required under that jail plan; the funding of such necessary personnel clearly rests with the fiscal court under <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.006" target="_self">KRS 441.006</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.008" target="_self">441.008 </a></cite>(now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.025" target="_self">KRS 441.025</a></cite> and <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.235" target="_self">441.235)</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-421</cite></cite>, modified by <cite class="OAG"> <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-421</cite></cite>.

      <p>
       City police staff may take an arrested person, where the local courts are not open or available for an appearance, to the local jailer who must accept the prisoner for housing in the local jail, or in the contract jail where no space is available in the local jail, until the court magistrate becomes available. The local jailer must transport such prisoner (who is to be tried locally) to the contract jail, except where otherwise agreed by contract. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-476</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the fiscal court of the first county has, pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.006ol12b" target="_self">KRS 441.006(2)(b)</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.025ol12c" target="_self">KRS 441.025(2)(c)</a></cite>), contracted with a second county to house prisoners who will be tried by the courts in the first county, the jailer or his deputies of the first county, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, has the responsibility of the transportation of such prisoners to the contract jail and back where necessary, and under subsection (3) of this section of transporting such prisoners to the proper court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-549</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section is rather generally worded, the primary duty of transporting prisoners to the courts rest upon the sheriff, unless the circumstances fall within one of the exceptions established by subdivisions (1)(a)(b) and other former provisions of this section. However, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.050" target="_blank">KRS 71.050</a></cite>, the jailer, as an officer of the court subject to the court’s command, shall perform such duty when ordered to do so by the court. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-550</cite>, aff’g 80-23 and modifying 82-421. (Opinion prior to 1996 amendment.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal of jailer to conduct the transport of county jail prisoner who was in need of medical attention was valid since it is the duty of the sheriff to furnish transportation in such cases after being informed of the need by the jailer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-578</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a county jail prisoner needs medical attention the county judge/executive or the fiscal court have no authority to enforce <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.040" target="_blank">KRS 71.040</a></cite> and this section relating to the relative responsibilities of the jailer and the sheriff in obtaining such attention for the prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 82-578</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county contracts with another county for incarceration of its prisoners, the jailer in the county of trial, by the explicit and certain terms of subsection (3) of this section, is given the responsibility for transporting prisoners to and from the county where the prisoners are incarcerated, except as otherwise agreed by contract; this would include transporting the prisoners to the county of trial for medical attention and treatment. However, where the prisoners are to be taken to medical authorities in the county where the prisoners are incarcerated, such transportation of ill or injured prisoners to the medical authorities rests with the sheriff of the county of incarceration. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-51</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a first county’s jail is closed and has necessitated the fiscal court’s contracting with other counties for the housing of the county’s prisoners, the jailer of that first county has the responsibility for transporting that county’s prisoners from the now closed county jail to a jail or jails made available under contract by one or more other counties, except as otherwise agreed in such contracts. This responsibility of transporting such county prisoners to the contract jails applies to the county jailer, regardless of whether the arresting officers were city policemen, county policemen or state police officers. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-299</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       An arresting officer in a county which has closed its jail and contracted with other counties for housing its prisoners has the responsibility of either bringing the arrested person to the proper court, if in session, or to that county’s jailer for transportation to a contract jail, where the prisoner will await court appearance. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-299</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the local jail is closed and the prisoners are transported to a jail in another county, the local jailer is responsible for transporting such prisoners to and from such detention facility; however, the providing of the necessary vehicle for such transportation is the same as if the local jail were operational, that is, it is a joint responsibility of the fiscal court and jailer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-368</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Off-duty members of a police department, located in a county having no county jail, may serve as assistants to the county jailer and receive compensation from the county for transportation of prisoners to a jail in an adjacent county so long as the police officers are employed as drivers of vehicles or guards; the off-duty police officers could not serve as deputy jailers. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-450</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county sheriff or local police officer cannot be paid an arrest fee and transportation expenses for arresting and transporting a member of the National Guard pursuant to a “Warrant of Arrest on Military Charges.” <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-487</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fiscal court has the responsibility of procuring the necessary automobiles for the sheriff’s statutory functions where it appears that the sheriff’s fees are not wholly sufficient for that purpose; thus, to the extent that the expense allowance and sheriff’s fees are not wholly sufficient to fund the acquisition cost of automobiles and the cost of operation, the fiscal court has the responsibility of funding such costs out of the county treasury, under available budgeted county funds. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-140</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (3) of this section requires the county jailer to transport prisoners, who are subject to the county courts, to and from jail facilities in other counties, which prisoners are in excess of the county jail space available, where the county contracts with such other counties for jail space, except as otherwise agreed by contract. The subsection does not require formal written contracts; it is sufficient that there is an oral or informal understanding relating to the contractual arrangement. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-140</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until July 13, 1984, where the jailer’s deputy assists the jailer as transportation officer, the county treasurer should disburse the compensation earned and payable to this deputy from the available budgeted “jail budget” funds; on and after July 13, 1984, the jailer’s deputy can no longer pursue that role and it is then up to the fiscal court to provide any necessary vehicles, drivers and guards for whoever is transportation officer. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-179</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A District Judge could order a jailer/transportation officer to transport an arrestee to a treatment facility. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-180</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       After July 13, 1984, when a prisoner has been arrested and lodged in another county on a warrant issued by a county whose jail is closed, it is the fiscal court’s responsibility to transport that prisoner back to the county holding the warrant. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-180</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the fiscal court did not designate the county jailer as transportation officer, the jailer would be required, under this section, to serve as bailiff to the Circuit and District Courts of the county, as provided in <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.050" target="_blank">KRS 71.050</a></cite>; in addition, the fiscal court, under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.130" target="_blank">KRS 67.130</a></cite>, could require the jailer to serve as custodian of county buildings and grounds, provided that such property custodian duties did not conflict with his role as court bailiff since, under the statutory provisions, the bailiff function has priority. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-231</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a county having no jail, the fiscal court, not the jailer as transportation officer, would have the authority to hire, under the jail budget, any necessary personnel for transporting prisoners. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-289</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county has a county jail in full operation, under a former provision of this section, the sheriff of that county has the responsibility of transporting that county’s prisoners (prisoners to be tried in that county) as necessary; the sheriff of that county must also transport that county’s prisoners who need medical care or attention, as determined pursuant to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.045ol19" target="_self">KRS 441.045(9)</a></cite>. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-330</cite>. (Opinion prior to 1996 amendment.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the state police arrested an individual and brought the individual to a county jail and placed said individual in the custody of the jailer and the jailer then determined he did not have space for the individual and made arrangement for the prisoner to be housed in another facility since the prisoner was detained in the county jail even though he may not have been assigned to a specific room or cell he was at that point confined in a detention facility until he was transported to another facility, thus under former provision of this section the sheriff of the county has the responsibility to transport the prisoner to another detention facility. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-349</cite>. (Opinion prior to 1996 amendment.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If some person other than the sheriff is to legally transport excess prisoners to another county jail, it would require an order of the local court which has criminal jurisdiction of the prisoner. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-354</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county has a jail, the sheriff is required to transport the prisoners, charged in that county, as such transportation becomes necessary; this responsibility rests with the sheriff of that county, even where the prisoners must be taken to another county jail for lack of space in the first county’s jail. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 84-354</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county has a holdover jail, the fiscal court should establish a reasonable salary for the jailer, based upon his range of functions, as described in subsection (4) of this section, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.050" target="_blank">KRS 71.050</a></cite>, and <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.130" target="_blank">67.130,</a></cite> and actual performance thereof. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-6</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is no county jail, this section permits the fiscal court to appoint a transportation officer, who may be the jailer, or the sheriff or someone else; however, regardless of the person appointed, under those three choices, there is no statutory provision requiring the transportation officer to live at the closed jail, or any particular place. Under <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.020" target="_blank">KRS 71.020</a></cite>, where there is a jail in operation, and where the jail is suitable for living purposes, the jailer, or one of his deputies, may reside in the jail; however, even if the jailer is the transportation officer, <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc71s71.020" target="_blank">KRS 71.020</a></cite> does not apply, since it applies only to an operational jail. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 85-44</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory duty imposed upon the sheriff to transport prisoners (except in an urban county, and as otherwise provided), transcends availability of funds. If a county does not have resources to pay for prisoner transportation, the sheriff’s office must nonetheless carry out such responsibility as part of the statutorily assigned duties of the office. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-88</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fiscal court not prohibited from hiring, as a county employee, one also holding the office of constable, to assist in transporting or guarding prisoners as long as there is no statutory incompatibility between the two (2) positions. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 91-175</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes place the general responsibility for transporting prisoners with the sheriff, with the fiscal court being responsible for providing funding for such responsibility through the jail budget. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-47</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the fiscal court requires the jailer to serve as a prisoner transportation officer, he could only be assigned additional duties as bailiff if, it is first determined that both functions can be compatibly performed (prisoner transportation responsibilities might involve scheduling conflicts with bailiff duties), the jailer agrees to such additional duties, and additional compensation for such duties is provided. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-128</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Implicit in the provisions of this section is that a jailer, in a county which does not have a jail (as in Spencer County), is required to perform either prisoner transportation duties, or bailiff duties, but not both. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-128</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       House Bill 408 amended <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.09.html#tIXc67s67.130" target="_blank">KRS 67.130</a></cite> and subsection (4) of this section to provide that the fiscal court may no longer require the jailer to act both as bailiff to the Circuit and District Courts, and as custodian of county buildings and grounds. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 92-128</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (3) (c) of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.530" target="_self">KRS 441.530</a></cite> (now repealed) is a very flexible statutory provision and allows the fiscal court great leeway when it comes to counties which operate a holdover jail. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 94-10</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is up to the fiscal court to adopt a transportation plan for transportation of prisoners as necessary; however, if the fiscal court does not adopt a transportation plan then transportation of prisoners will be provided for as provided in subsection (1) of this section. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 94-10</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding transportation of prisoners from the county jail to the Circuit Court, it is up to the fiscal court to adopt a transportation plan; the simplest procedure would be to designate either the jailer or sheriff to be responsible for transporting prisoners in all cases so as to avoid the inevitable conflicts which would arise when the sheriff or jailer would transport the prisoners depending on the situation. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 94-10</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this section, in a county that has a jail, is not an urban-county, and unless otherwise ordered by the court, responsibility for transportation of prisoners held on criminal charges in the county jail, from the jail to a psychiatric facility, rests with the county sheriff. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 95-7</cite>.

       A Circuit Judge can prohibit a District Judge or trial commissioner from exercising any authority under this section except where the District Judge is “filling in” for the absent Circuit Judge. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-129</cite>.

      <p>
       Under the literal language of this section, the transfer of prisoners from one county jail to another for security purposes or where there is no county jail relates exclusively to prisoners under the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, conversely, it cannot be used as a vehicle for the transfer of District Court prisoners. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-129</cite>.

       A sheriff is required to transport prisoners placed in his custody as far as is necessary to execute the orders of the courts as to the prisoners’ place of confinement. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-482</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Circuit Court has ordered the transfer of a prisoner to another county’s jail because of the failure of the fiscal court to provide adequate facilities to house the prisoner, then the sheriff may be reimbursed as per the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.08.html#tVIIIc64s64.070" target="_blank">KRS 64.070</a></cite> from county funds; the court must state in its order that the costs shall be borne by the county. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-482</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The judge has the primary duty to determine where the defendant is to be committed and to enter an order directing such commitment; however, the court may order the sheriff to keep it informed of what facilities are available for housing the prisoners, and where the judges have ordered the sheriff to keep them informed of what facilities are available to house prisoners, he must do so. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 80-482</cite>.

       The compensation to be paid to receiving county by sending county for the keeping of sending county’s prisoners must depend upon the mutual agreement of the two (2) fiscal courts, which agreement should involve a reasonable compensation for the detention services furnished, framed around the actual costs of furnishing such detention facilities; the cost elements could include a consideration of the original construction cost of the receiving county’s jail, the space allotted per prisoner, the cost of utilities, the present cost of replacement of the jail if it had to be rebuilt, the level of standards in terms of what would be considered adequate jail housing, the operational and salary costs relating to the jailer and his deputies, including furnishing of food. An agreement based upon the sending county’s sharing in both the operational and capital construction costs would be equitable, and would meet the fundamental fairness concept expressed in Const., § 2. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 83-26</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (3) (c) of this section (now repealed) is a very flexible statutory provision and allows the fiscal court great leeway when it comes to counties which operate a holdover jail. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 94-10</cite>.

     Prisoner transferred to penitentiary when violence threatened — Officer’s compensation.
     </h3>
     <p>
      If there exists threatened violence or intense feeling and public indignation against a person charged with a crime and in the custody of an officer, and the Circuit Judge of the county that has jurisdiction of the offense charged is of the opinion that the person cannot be safely kept in the jail in that county, the Circuit Judge, with the consent of the Governor, may order such person removed for safekeeping to the state penitentiary most convenient to the county having jurisdiction of the offense charged. In the absence of the Circuit Judge from the county, the District Judge of the county may exercise the powers conferred by this section upon the Circuit Judge. The officer who makes the removal shall be entitled to the actual expenses in making the removal, and in addition he shall receive a fee of five dollars ($5) per day for himself and two and one-half dollars ($2.50) per day each for not more than two (2) guards. The claim for fees and expenses shall be presented for approval to the Circuit Court of the county having jurisdiction of the offense. The compensation shall be allowed by the Circuit or District Judge directing the transfer and paid out of the treasury of the responsible unit of government.

     <ol>
      <li id="tXLc441s441.640ol11">
       The authority may provide for the issuance of revenue bonds to pay any part of the cost of any projects undertaken pursuant to an agreement and lease; provided that, the authority shall not issue bonds before July 15, 1983, and until the total amount of revenues collected and deposited in the authority’s fund equals or exceeds two million dollars ($2,000,000). The principal and interest on such bonds are payable solely from the funds provided for such payment. Any issue may be in one (1) or more series and any such series may enjoy equal or subordinate status with respect to the pledge of funds from which they are payable, shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as established by the authority, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, all as may be provided by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of the bonds and shall fix the denomination of the bonds and the place or places for payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth or at the office of the Finance and Administration Cabinet. The bonds shall be signed by the facsimile signature of the chairman or secretary of the authority, and the seal of the authority or a facsimile thereof shall be affixed thereto and attested by the manual signature or a facsimile thereof of the secretary or chairman of the authority. All bonds issued under the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.625" target="_self">KRS 441.625</a></cite> to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.695" target="_self">441.695 </a></cite>shall have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the uniform commercial code, KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.29.html#tXXIXc355" target="_blank">Chapter 355</a></cite>. The authority may sell such bonds at public or private sale.
      </li>
      <li id="tXLc441s441.640ol12">
       The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects for which such bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund or funds for such bonds or any account or accounts therein as the authority shall have provided in the proceedings or trust indenture authorizing and securing such bonds.
      </li>
      <li id="tXLc441s441.640ol13">
       Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue notes or temporary bonds exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost.

       The terms of the trust indenture under which bonds or notes are issued may delegate to the trustee the authority to establish procedures for the physical delivery of bond or note certificates either at the time of original issuance or on subsequent transfers but any such method shall be subject to the approval of the authority.

      In the discretion of the authority, any bonds issued under the provisions of <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.625" target="_self">KRS 441.625</a></cite> to <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.695" target="_self">441.695 </a></cite>may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company in or outside of Kentucky. Such trust indenture or the proceedings providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the rents and other revenues to be received. The trust indenture or proceedings may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders which are reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, and insurance of the project or projects in connection with which such bonds are authorized, the rates or rental charges, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. It is lawful for any bank or trust company which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee. In addition, any such trust indenture or proceedings may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture or proceedings may be treated as a part of the cost of the project or projects.

        <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.005" target="_self">KRS 441.005</a></cite> provides for a separate definition of the terms “Jail” and “regional jail.” A jail is defined as a county jail or correctional and detention facility while a regional jail is defined as a jail “owned and operated by two (2) or more counties through a regional jail authority as provided in this section.” Regional Jail Authority v. Tackett, 770 S.W.2d 225, 1989 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 25</cite> (Ky. 1989).

        The power vested in the regional jail authority to “provide for the operation and maintenance” of the regional jail necessarily carries with it the power to employ an administrator and other personnel to operate the regional jail free of any direct participation by the jailers and fiscal courts of the counties involved.

        This section does not usurp the functions of a county jailer. The construction of a regional jail does not require the abolition or discontinuance of a county jail. If, however, after the construction of a regional jail, a county wishes to discontinue its county jail, <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXLc441s441.510ol14" target="_self">KRS 441.510(4)</a></cite> prescribes the duties of the county jailer.

       Long term housing of prisoners of the State of Kentucky is a function constitutionally mandated to the state, and the role sought to be assumed by a county in housing not only state prisoners, but prisoners of jurisdictions outside Kentucky, is not provided for by statute and is not a function necessary for operation of the county; accordingly, the county may not lawfully lease and operate a 336 bed detention center or prison for such purpose; such action is not necessary for operation of the county and handling the types of prisoners envisioned under this project is “otherwise provided for” by statute and the Kentucky Constitution. <cite class="OAG"> OAG 90-115</cite>.
