        A circuit court clerk may not issue an order of attachment where the defendant has not been served with a summons since subdivision (3) of this section specifically requires that a copy of the complaint, motion and summons be either delivered to the debtor or mailed by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested) to the debtor, and that is tantamount to requiring that the summons must be served on the defendant prior to the issuance of an order of attachment.

        Kentucky's garnishment statutes and law are preempted by the federal regulations in 31 C.F.R. § 212 et seq. because (1) Kentucky law does not give a garnishee standing to assert an exemption on behalf of a judgment debtor, but the federal regulations require a garnishee financial institution to unilaterally determine if any funds in the institution's possession are exempted by federal law, and, (2) if a garnishee identifies money belonging to a judgment debtor, the garnishee must turn the money over to the sheriff, the attorney for the judgment creditor, or the clerk of court, but the federal regulations expressly prohibit the garnishee from turning any exempt funds over and require the garnishee to ensure that the judgment debtor has free access to those funds.

        Circuit court did not err in applying Kentucky law to uphold the garnishment order where there was no dispute as to its facial validity, and the garnishee had actual knowledge of the garnishment and expressed her knowledge that she could have claimed exemptions from it.

        Even though this section apparently calls exclusively for service of an order of garnishment by the sheriff, under the express provisions of CR 4.01 the clerk may, at the discretion of the plaintiff, place a copy of the order of garnishment to be served in an envelope, address the envelope to the garnishee-defendant at the address set forth in the caption or at the address set forth in written instructions by plaintiff, affix adequate postage, and place the sealed envelope in the United States mail as certified mail return receipt requested with instructions to the delivering postal employee to deliver to the addressee only and show the address where delivered and the date of delivery, etc., as specifically required by CR 4.01, and such will suffice as personal service.

        Although the garnishment order creates a lien on the debtor’s nonexempt wages, it does not divest the debtor of his or her interest in the wages; the garnishment summons merely initiates the procedure whereby the creditor seeks to apply the debtor’s nonexempt wages in satisfaction of the underlying judgment. In re Harville, 63 B.R. 371, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 5671 (Bankr. W.D.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The date of transfer is the date the garnishment lien is created, which under Kentucky law, is the date of service of the summons upon the garnishee. Wilkey v. Credit Bureau Sys. (In re Clark), 171 B.R. 563, 1994 Bankr. LEXIS 1397 (Bankr. W.D.

       </p>
       <p>
        According to this section, the date of transfer with regard to a garnishment is the date of service of the garnishment order upon the garnishee; thus a preferential conveyance did not occur within the 180 days preceding the bankruptcy filing as required by KRS

Performance of such bonds, for the forthcoming of property, may be enforced, as in cases of contempt; upon such bonds for payment of money, execution may be issued as upon replevin bonds.

        is clear that the statute establishes both (1) that a judgment creditor shall not be able to recover more than a garnishee owes to a judgment creditor's debtor, and (2) that in no instance can the judgment creditor obtain a judgment against the garnishee greater than the judgment against the original debtor, so the statute plainly sets a ceiling, not a floor and does not suggest in any way that the judgment creditor is automatically entitled to recover the full amount of the judgment from the garnishee irrespective of holdings of the garnishee in relation to the judgment debtor, but, in fact, states precisely the opposite.

       <p>
        In order for a judgment creditor to recover an underlying judgment from a garnishee, the judgment creditor must establish that the garnishee's actions caused the creditor to suffer actual damages, which, in most cases, will be measured by the amount the garnishee failed to turn over or freeze and that the judgment creditor is able to establish the creditor would have collected under the garnishment order, but for the garnishee's failure, and the statute cannot be used to punish a garnishee for a mere technical violation that did not result in actual money or other property being wrongfully withheld from the judgment creditor.

        Lower court committed reversible error by recognizing validity of deficiency judgment against mortgagor because mortgagor’s obligation to bank/mortgagee, was extinguished when bank, in breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing, contracted with third parties to sell the mortgaged property during the foreclosure action and, in fact, ultimately sold the property for an amount which would have wholly satisfied the debt owed by mortgagor.

     <p>
      The plaintiff in an action for enforcing a lien on property shall state in his petition the liens held thereon by others, making them defendants; and may ask for and obtain a judgment for a sale of the property to satisfy all of said liens which are shown to exist, though the defendants fail to assert their claims. Such defendants shall not, however, be allowed to withdraw or receive any of the proceeds of such sale, until they have shown their right thereto by answer and cross claim, which shall be asserted as provided in the Rules of Civil Procedure.

        Where decedent’s administrator brought an action to settle estate and to sell real estate, including a tract of land conveyed to the decedent and his wife jointly, upon which a vendor’s lien was retained and vendor and the widow were made parties to the action and served with process and petition set up the lien of the vendor and then vendor filed a petition asserting his lien but no process thereon was served on the widow and land covered by the deed was ordered sold but did not bring enough to satisfy the debt. Several years later the widow brought a suit to set aside the commissioner’s deed and to recover a half interest in the property since the widow was served with process on the original petition, she was before the court for the purposes of the sale, and the judgment and other proceedings barred her right of recovery, it not being necessary that she should have been served with process on the petition of the vendor, since his lien was set up in the original petition and the vendor did not seek a personal judgment against the widow.

        While it is true that a plaintiff in a cross petition must have a summons executed upon the defendant in the cross petition in order to obtain a person judgment, a judgment which gave the defendant lienholders only a lien upon property rather than a personal judgment against the property owners is valid.

        Where a lienholder was made a defendant in an action by the wife against her husband to determine the ownership of certain realty, issuance of summons on the lienholder’s cross petition for sale of the property was not a prerequisite to the lienholder’s right to have the property sold and to receive its portion of the proceeds, since the cross petition did not ask for a personal judgment against the husband.

        In an action to assert a mortgage lien upon real property which was dismissed by agreement between plaintiff and the mortgagor, and then was subsequently reinstated by petition, the court determined that a junior mortgagee should have been made a party to the petition reinstating the action, but the failure to do so did not prejudice his rights in the property.

        Although a provision of the secured party’s security agreement with the debtor enabled it to pay liens and taxes on the collateral and charge same to debtor, the secured party’s security interest was extinguished and provisions of the security agreement became inoperative upon sale of the collateral at the judicial sale. Therefore, the secured party could not gratuitously pay the mechanic’s lienholder and charge same to the debtor. Owens v. First Commonwealth Bank, 706 S.W.2d 414, 1985

        The writ of execution essentially directs the sheriff to go out in the county and discover, if possible, any property owned by the judgment debtor, levy on it, and sell it to liquidate the judgment sum awarded; the sheriff, upon making a levy on the property, has the right to take such property into immediate possession, or he may leave it in the possession of the debtor or any other person, but the person holding possession after the levy would hold it as a bailee of the sheriff.

        The issuance of an execution is controlled by the recovering party, not by the circuit clerk. Thus, where the judgment debtor has insufficient personal property upon which execution can be had, the circuit clerk has no statutory authority to require the issuance of two executions, one for personalty and one for real estate; the one writ which the judgment plaintiff has procured (issued) will suffice.

        A plea of the statute of limitations is not necessary in an action to enforce satisfaction of a judgment on a return of no property found, but to entitle plaintiff to recover he must allege and prove that the execution on which his action is based was issued before the judgment was barred by the statute of limitations.

       <p>
        A sheriff who has collected money under an execution must pay it over to the execution creditor or his attorney or to any other person having his written authority on due demand, and he has no right to delay such payment of money to the person entitled to it when demand is made prior to the return date, since the purpose of the return date is merely to give the officer sufficient time to find property which will satisfy the execution and make his return thereon.

      If an execution against property is issued and the plaintiff desires to take out another at his own cost, the clerk may issue it although the previous execution has not been returned. If the execution is returned in whole or in part not satisfied, a new one may issue. On a joint judgment against several persons the execution must be joint.

        In Kentucky creditor obtained lien upon debtor’s property by delivery of execution to sheriff and this lien was as absolute before levy as it was afterwards. Lessee of Waller v. Best, 44 U.S. 111, 11 L. Ed. 518, 1845 U.S. LEXIS 426 (U.S. 1845) (decided under prior law).

        Effect of statutory provision making execution bind estate of defendant from time of its delivery to officer is to create lien for its payment from that time. C. T. C. Inv. Co. v. Daniel Boone Coal Corp., 58 F.2d 305, 1931 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2045 (D.

        The difference between the lien before levy and that after levy would seem to be that in the one case it is general and in the other it is specific. C. T. C. Inv. Co. v. Daniel Boone Coal Corp., 58 F.2d 305, 1931 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2045 (D.

        Execution upon judgment in action by state against sheriff and surety on his bond created lien on surety’s property only from time execution was delivered to officer, and hence was inferior to mortgage previously given by surety, notwithstanding action had been commenced before mortgage was given, where state elected to take execution instead of adjudication of lien under KRS

        Unpublished decision:
        Appellant claimant’s arguments that her claim against a corporation had priority over an investment company’s interest in the corporation were meritless; although the claimant’s claim was best characterized as simply a contract claim (her judgment against the corporation was obtained during the litigation stay and she had not shown, or even asserted, that she converted her judgment into a lien), even if it was assumed that the claimant obtained a lien on the assets of the corporation, her claim would still have been subordinate to the investment company’s claim under any of the priority schemes that might have applied.

        Although officer may levy on as much property as he deems necessary to satisfy execution, yet he should exercise ordinary care to ascertain value of property levied on and should not levy on property having peculiar valuable quality, as blood in horses or cows, when levy on less valuable property would suffice.

        Levy on personal property was valid, where execution debtor surrendered certain property to sheriff, and sheriff indorsed levy on execution, describing the property and stating that it was given to him by debtor, although the property was not present, was never seen by sheriff, and remained in debtor’s possession. Carlisle v. Wathen, 78

       </p>
       <p>
        Reason for rule that to constitute valid levy upon personal property, officer must do some act which would amount to trespass except for protection of the process is that the parties, especially the defendant, should know that levy has been made and that the property levied on should be known. Carlisle v. Wathen, 78
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. 365

       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule was that it was necessary to validity of levy upon personal property that officer should do some act which would be a trespass but for the process. Carlisle v. Wathen, 78

        A mere paper levy upon personal property amounts to nothing; possession or control must be taken, and mere indorsement or execution or statement to owner that levy was made on certain personal property without other action by officer was no levy. Demint v. Thompson, 80

        In an execution on personal property it is sufficient that the officer do something equivalent to a claim of dominion over the property with the power to enforce the claim but it is not necessary that he do that which amounts to a change of possession.

       <p>
        The issuance of an execution is controlled by the recovering party, not by the circuit clerk. Thus, where the judgment debtor has insufficient personal property upon which execution can be had, the circuit clerk has no statutory authority to require the issuance of two executions, one for personalty and one for real estate; the one writ which the judgment plaintiff has procured (issued) will suffice.

        Sheriff was legally empowered to select appraisers, and if he permitted plaintiff and defendant each to select appraiser, he was acting merely from courtesy and not in discharge of legal duty. Knight v. Whitman, 69

        Failure to have the property appraised or to have the appraisers sworn was mere irregularity of sheriff in making sale and would not affect title of purchaser unless he participated in the irregularity. Sayers v. Hahn, 12 Ky. Op. 313, 5

        Even if provisions of law respecting appraisal of land before sale were not so mandatory that failure to observe them literally would nullify sale, a failure which was material to debtor’s rights would, in equity, permit him to redeem. Vallandigham v. Worthington, 85

        Lack of appraisement was shown, where recitals in sheriff’s deed were overcome by testimony of witnesses, and sheriff did not say in his deposition that land was appraised. Brandenburgh v. Beach, 32 S.W. 168, 17

        Appraisement of real estate was not invalidated as against objection that deputy sheriff had no authority to administer oath to appraisers, since even if there was no direct authority to officer to administer such oath, failure to have appraisers sworn would not affect purchaser unless he participated in the irregularity.

        Appraisement sufficiently showed value of remainderman’s interest to be $1,400, where land was valued at $2,000 in all and life tenant’s interest at $600. Guelot v. Pearce, 38 S.W. 892, 18

        Since law that provided that a mortgage conveying legal or equitable property shall be valid against a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, until such mortgage is acknowledged or recorded, implied that mortgages, though unrecorded, were not void, but were valid against purchaser at sale under execution, as well as at private sale, when notice had been given, holder of unrecorded chattel mortgage given before execution was delivered to officer could arrest sale under execution notwithstanding creditor had no notice of mortgage before levy, where mortgagee asserted his rights before sale.

        By levy of execution on land, creditor acquires only equity and if, before sale, he has notice of another equity evidenced by bond or unrecorded deed, which is older than equity acquired by execution, the older equity prevails. Bean v. Everett, 56 S.W. 403, 21

        Under this section a purchaser of encumbered property at a sheriff’s sale does not acquire title but only acquires a lien; further a purchaser at a sheriff’s sale is not an innocent purchaser simply because he has purchased at a judicial sale or acquired under legal process. A prevalent misconception is that one purchasing at a judicial sale gets something of a superior title simply because of his position. Tabers v.

        A judgment in an action of claim and delivery for the return of the property or its value is a judgment for money.

        While the claim for damages might have been specifically made in the answer and counterclaim and brought down to date of restitution by amendment in an action to recover possession of a team of mules, harness, and a wagon, the successful defendant took appropriate course to secure a consideration of his claim of damages suffered through the plaintiff’s taking and detention of the property under the order of delivery 15 months before by filing a motion on the day judgment was entered, although perhaps his motion should have been more specific as to the element of damages in order that issues might have been raised thereto.

        It was error for the court to instruct the jury “not to find for the plaintiff more than one cent damages.” If the plaintiff was entitled to recover at all for the failure to return the execution within 30 days after the return day, he was entitled to recover 30 percent on the sum named in the execution.

        In an action under this section against a sheriff for failure to consummate an execution sale and make timely return of the execution, there is no basis for allowing interest on the penalty until it has been adjudicated and since the liability of the sheriff for the amount of the execution is likewise in the nature of a penalty, interest should be allowed on the amount of the execution and penalty only from the date of judgment.

        As the failure to return was admitted, the plaintiff’s case was made out. While plaintiff must allege that the failure to return was without reasonable excuse, that allegation is supported by proof that the execution was placed in the officer’s hands while in effect and was not returned within 30 days after the return day.

        Sheriff was not liable for money which he collected upon execution, where, after serving summons, he himself paid defendant’s debt to plaintiff’s attorney, and later, after plaintiff had recovered judgment and issued execution, collected from defendant, returned execution satisfied, and retained money as his own.

        A sheriff who has collected money under an execution must pay it over to the execution creditor or his attorney or to any other person having his written authority on due demand, and he has no right to delay such payment of money to the person entitled to it when demand is made prior to the return date, since the purpose of the return date is merely to give the officer sufficient time to find property which will satisfy the execution and make his return thereon.

Upon the filing of such amended petition the case shall be transferred to the equity docket and summons issued thereon.

        Plaintiff, having a return of nulla bona as to a judgment in the quarterly court, filed a transcript in the Circuit Court and sued out execution which was returned “no property.” The court held that plaintiff may maintain an action upon the return, although the property he seeks to subject was subject to execution, and his right will be superior to that of a creditor who has his execution levied upon the property pending the action, or to that of a lis pendens purchaser, since plaintiff has a right to act upon the return of the officer, and acquires a lien by his suit, although the officer’s return be false.

        The return of “no property” upon an execution not directed either to the county in which the judgment was rendered, or to the county of the residence of the defendant against whom the judgment is sought to be enforced, will not enable the plaintiff to maintain such an action. The fact that the execution was directed to the county of the residence of some other defendant in the judgment than the one whose property is sought to be subjected will not authorize the action. But if the execution was directed to the county in which the judgment was rendered the action may be maintained against any of the defendants. Proctor v. Bell's Adm'r, 97

        A return of “no property” upon an execution from a justice’s or quarterly court does not entitle the creditor to resort to an equitable action to subject the land of his debtor.

        A return of “no property” will not support a suit to set aside a conveyance as fraudulent unless the execution so returned was one under which land could have been levied on and sold.

        Where a farm in the name of the husband was sold shortly before his insolvency and another was purchased in the wife’s name, the burden of proving the bona fides of the transactions was shifted to the wife, but, by proving that there was a prior agreement by which the husband, due to his heavy drinking, was allowed to live with the family only if the profits of the farm were shared with the wife and children and that the second farm was purchased from these shares of the wife and children, the wife sustained this burden and the chancellor properly refused to subject the farm to the husband’s debts.

        Where a defendant pleads and shows his discharge in bankruptcy, there can be no personal judgment against him. The remedy of plaintiff was to subject the land upon which the debt was sued to a lien. Boyer v. Lincoln, 11 Ky. Op. 437, 3

        On a return of “no property” plaintiffs in the execution filed a bill against the defendant for the discovery and subjection of property unknown to the plaintiffs. This bill did not operate as a lien until the discovery was made by the filing of the answer. Such lien, however, is inferior to lien of other judgment creditors who filed a similar action in the meantime, charging that defendant had a vendible interest in certain described land, and prayed for the subjection of it to their debt.

        Petition, in action under this section, praying for a general order of attachment, but failing to describe any particular property sought to be subjected to judgment debt, is insufficient to create a lis pendens lien, since a lis pendens can only be asserted in a suit in rem, prosecuted with reasonable diligence, for relief against specific property which is identified by the proceedings to which proceedings the other claimant is an actual party.

        By the filing of the petition in an action on a return of “no property found” and a description of the land in the petition, the appellant acquired a lien on the land, valid as against intervening petitioner who did not allege recording of the lien claimed, and where, in fact, there could be no recording because it was not claimed by virtue of a writing.

        A creditor, who, having a return of nulla bona against his debtor, institutes suit in equity to subject the choses in action, equitable or legal interest, or other property of his debtor, acquires a lien on such property or effects, on the service on the defendant of a summons, with the objects of the suit indorsed on it.

        In an action on a return of “no property” where the proceeding is to subject property specifically described, no attachment levy is necessary to give a lien as against the defendant in the action. In such case the main object of the action being to subject the property in controversy, and it being sufficiently described in order for identification, an equitable lien is created as against the debtor by the filing of the petition and the service of summons.

        Where suit in equity under this section described the property subject to bank’s claim, and those who claimed to be the owners of the property were made defendants and were actually summoned, such action creates a lis pendens lien upon the property sought to be subjected, without any attachment, or any indorsement on the summons, of the object of the action.

       <p>
        Replevin bonds required by statute are valid common-law obligations even when not executed according to statutory requirements. Issued bond, whether statutorily required or not, is good at common law if executed voluntarily for valid consideration, and not repugnant to letter or policy of law. Thompson v. Buckhannon, 25
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. 416

       </p>
       <p>
        Replevin bonds, postponing payment of judgment for six (6) months and not three, were not statutory bonds upon which execution could issue, but were common-law bonds binding upon obligators after plaintiff had refrained for six (6) months from enforcing judgment. Vertrees v. Shean, 59

       </p>
       <p>
        Replevin bonds which postponed payment of a judgment for six (6) months rather than three are not statutory bonds which can be subject to execution but are common-law bonds which bind the obligor if plaintiff has not enforced the judgment within six (6) months. Hardwick Woolen Mills v. Ball Bros., 223
        <cite class="ky_code">

        The defendant may replevy a money judgment, if an execution thereon has not been placed in the hands of a collecting officer, for three months before the police judge entering the judgment, by giving bond with good surety to be approved by the judge.

        Where a defendant is convicted and does not replevy and does not pay the fine and costs, he shall be put in jail. And he is given a credit of $2.00 or $1.00 per day, depending upon whether he is worked or not, toward the payment of the fine and costs. If that occurs, i.e., if he satisfies such costs by merely being in jail, or working in jail, it means that the arresting officer would not recover his arresting fees because the county is not responsible for paying the costs, including arresting fees and thus the arresting fees will go unpaid.

        Where real estate is sold to enforce a junior lien, the thing that is sold is the debtor’s equity in the reality, subject to the prior lien, the property must be appraised as a whole, and the purchaser, in order to cut off the debtor’s right of redemption and obtain a deed, must bid at least two thirds (2/3) of the value of the debtor’s equity as computed by deducting the amount of the prior lien from the total appraised value.

        A sheriff is not personally or officially responsible for court costs, including the expense of advertising and appraisers’ fees in connection with a judicial sale of property in which he participates at the direction of the court; such items are a part of the costs, subject to the directions of the court as to who has to pay them.

        The phrase “intelligent housekeeper of the county” as used in subsection (1) of this section requires a subjective evaluation of an appraiser’s qualifications rather than a strict application of rules of domicile.

        The legislature did not intend the phrase “intelligent housekeepers of the county” contained in subsection (1) of this section to carry a precise, objective meaning. The statutory language is intended to provide subjective guidance to the master commissioner in selecting persons to serve as appraisers. If the master commissioner believes that a person’s general aptitude and knowledge of the county, whether derived through business activities, real estate management, or actual residency, qualifies the person to appraise real property, then the person is an “intelligent housekeeper of the county” within the meaning of the statute.

     Mortgage foreclosure forbidden — Rights of mortgagee after default.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Foreclosure of a mortgage is forbidden; provided, however, that this section shall not preclude a mortgagee after default from taking possession of property subject to the mortgage which has been abandoned by the mortgagor, for the purpose of preserving and maintaining the same, harvesting crops, or letting the same, all to the account of the mortgagor; and any reasonable expenses incident thereto including taxes and insurance shall be added to the principal of the mortgage, and secured by it. For the purpose of this section, property shall be deemed to have been abandoned when the mortgagor has moved from the property and when by the nature of the property in question when further neglect or failure to attend will decrease its value. Any right a mortgagee acquires in a tenant’s interest in crops raised on shares is inferior to any prior existing lien of the landlord on the tenant’s interest. Nothing in this section shall be construed as conflicting with the provisions of KRS

        The term “foreclosure” is generally and uniformly understood in modern times as a proceeding whereby a lien is enforced and property is sold through a proceeding in court to satisfy a debt. Hence, where policy of insurance provided that the policy shall be void, if foreclosure proceedings are commenced against the property, the court erred in sustaining demurrer to answer of insurance company asserting such proceeding as a defense against recovery on the policy.

        Where real estate is sold to enforce a junior lien, the thing that is sold is the debtor’s equity in the realty, subject to the prior lien, the property must be appraised as a whole, and the purchaser, in order to cut off the debtor’s right of redemption and obtain a deed, must bid at least two-thirds (2/3) of the value of the debtor’s equity as computed by deducting the amount of the prior lien from the total appraised value.

        Death of the plaintiff does not actually abate either the judgment or the execution, but it suspends all further proceedings on the execution until administration be granted and the clerk be authorized to make the proper indorsements thereon, as provided by law, so that the defendant may have the benefit of a sale on credit, or his right to replevy the debt.

        Upon the death of the plaintiff in judgment, the clerk, before indorsing upon an execution issued in the plaintiff’s name the fact of his death and the name of his personal representative, should require the person claiming the right to the execution to file an affidavit manifesting his right, and also a copy properly certified of his appointment as successor or representative. If the clerk makes the indorsement without requiring the affidavit and copy of appointment, the execution is not void but voidable merely, the requirement of the code being only directory and not mandatory.

        Judicial sale of land was not vitiated by failure of commissioner to post notices of sale upon land, since this is unnecessary unless so ordered by court. Ward v. Vanhoose, 222

        Unless contained in the order of the court, it is not necessary that notices of judicial sales be posted in addition to the newspaper advertisement, but where the order of sale requires posting, failure to do so is fatal to the sale. Miller v. Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co., 278

        Master commissioner in judicial sales is not required to post written notices unless the court so orders, and even if he fails to do so after court so orders, this fact does not render the sale void but constitutes ground for exceptions for which the sale may be set aside.

        Where parties to action agreed to waive newspaper advertisement of sale, and that posted notices would be sufficient, the fact that one of the parties forgot about the sale and failed to see the posted notices was not grounds for setting the sale aside, where the property brought 70 percent of the appraised value at the sale.

        In an action to recover land and the value of timber cut from it, it was error, at the conclusion of plaintiffs’ testimony, to peremptorily instruct the jury to find for defendants on the ground that the commissioner’s deed introduced was inadmissible for the reason that it was not indorsed “examined and approved” by the court, when it had been introduced without objection to it. It was too late, after plaintiffs’ evidence was closed, to make the objection, for plaintiffs were thereby deprived of the opportunity of supporting the deed by the orders of court, if such there were, and in that way making the deed competent evidence.

        That part of this section providing that a conveyance by a commissioner shall not pass any right until it has been examined and approved by the court is mandatory, but that part providing that the approval shall be indorsed on the conveyance and recorded with it is only directory; hence, the failure of the judge to indorse his approval on the deed does not render it invalid, or deprive it of its recordable character, where there is a judgment in the action reciting that the deed has been examined and approved by the court. In such a case the deed, together with the order showing the deed has been examined and approved by the court, is sufficient to make out a prima facie case of the regularity of the deed, and to authorize its introduction as evidence of title.

        A deed, executed by the commissioner and approved by the court after the case has gone off the docket, is invalid, unless the case has been restored to the docket upon notice, and that proper notice was given will be presumed, nothing appearing to show the contrary. Delay of 20 years to make a deed after the sale has been confirmed and the commissioner ordered to make it does not prevent the deed being made. Likens v. Pate, 160

        right to cure the default of their home mortgage under 11 USCS § 1322(c)(1) terminated before they filed their bankruptcy petition, even though they filed their petition within hours after their property was sold at a foreclosure sale, which was well before the master commissioner prepared and submitted his report to a state circuit court as required by CR 53.06. Pursuant to
        Sixth Circuit precedent, the right to cure under § 1322(c)(1) terminated once the last gavel fell at the foreclosure sale, not when the foreclosure proceedings were complete and the sale was confirmed, as provided for under Kentucky law.

        Where judgment was obtained by creditor against principal debtor and his sureties and shortly thereafter execution issued thereon and one of sureties paid debt and took assignment of the judgment and had an execution levied upon property for which claimant executed a bond to the assignor of judgment, the court determined he could not recover from the sureties in claimant’s bond because the bond was not executed to plaintiff in the execution.

        In an action against sureties in an indemnifying bond, where it was shown that an execution was issued upon a judgment and was levied upon a stock of goods and later the execution defendant obtained a discharge in bankruptcy, the court determined that a discharge in bankruptcy did not discharge the levy of execution and did not affect the right of a judgment creditor to recover on claimant’s bond.

        Where an execution has been levied upon a stock of merchandise, the execution of a claimant’s bond does not prevent the sheriff from proceeding against other property of the defendants, nor from allowing them to replevy the debt, but the entire satisfaction of the execution is not entire satisfaction of the bond if the sale was wrongfully suspended by its execution.

        In a motion for judgment upon a claimant’s bond, where the defendants in the execution replevy it after the execution of the claimant’s bond, the obligors in the bond are liable for the ten per cent damages and the costs resulting from the execution of the bond and, if the replevin bond should be quashed, the plaintiffs in the execution can proceed on the claimant’s bond.

        A third party executing a forthcoming bond for property levied on which recites it is the property of the execution defendant cannot, without proof of fraud or mistake, assert ownership and claim to such property by executing a claimant’s bond, and thereby prevent judgment against him on his forthcoming bond.

        In a motion for judgment upon a bond, it is not required that the plaintiff state in the notice, or show upon the trial, that he sustained any loss by reason of the execution of the bond, or that he could not have collected his debt otherwise that by a sale of the property; if property was subject to his execution, he was entitled to judgment.

        Where a claimant of property secured a release of a levy by the execution of a bond and the one having the execution levied had made motion for judgment against claimant and his sureties, the court had the discretion to decide who should bear the burden of proof, but when the plaintiff had proven the sheriff had found property in defendant’s possession, a prima facie case was made out for plaintiff and the court should have permitted the jury to weigh the evidence.

        In an action to foreclose a lien, the court may determine from the pleadings whether the property is readily divisible. Burge v. Chestnut, 121 S.W. 989 (
        <cite class="ky_code">

        Where the pleadings in an action to enforce liens not only showed that the property was residence property but alleged that it could not be divided without impairing its value, and the allegation was not denied, and none of the parties were infants, the chancellor was justified in adjudging the property indivisible, since the court could determine that question from the pleadings of the case.

        Where the description of the property sought to be subjected to a purchase money lien, as given in the petition, does not show whether or not the property is divisible, the better practice is to state the facts relative to that question in the petition. Baird v. Prewitt, 158

        An allegation that the land is divisible, or indivisible, is not required to be made by the pleadings, in an action to foreclose a vendor’s lien. If the court is satisfied, from the character of the boundary, or the number of acres in the tract, as described in the pleadings, that a division can be had, it is all that is required. Sears v. Henry, 76

        Where the petition gives such a description of the land sought to be subjected that the court may, from the description given, determine whether or not the land is susceptible of advantageous division, the allegation in that regard need not be made. Cockrill v. Mize, 12 S.W. 1040, 11

        In an action to enforce a lien against property, it is not necessary to allege that the property is indivisible and the court may order sale of part of the tract where it is satisfied from the character of the boundaries or the number of acres that a division may be made; therefore, in the absence of allegation or proof, the court was authorized to find that a 34 1/2-acre tract was divisible.

        Where it was evident that the land could have been divided and there was no evidence upon which to base the conclusion that a division was impracticable, and the debtor had been prejudiced by the order of the court directing a sale of the entire tract, it was the duty of the court, upon exceptions filed to the commissioner’s report, to set aside the sale, although made in strict conformity to the judgment, as the court, notwithstanding the judgment, had complete control over the mere manner of conducting the sale until the report of sale had been confirmed.

        Where there was no allegation in the petition, and no evidence in any form, that the real estate on which a materialman’s lien had attached could not be divided without materially impairing its value, and by the judgment the chancellor adjudged a sale of only enough of the property to satisfy the debt, amounting to $965, but under that judgment the commissioner sold the entire tract, which brought $3,300, such sale was not authorized.

        In an action to subject real property to the payment of debt, the court must be satisfied as to whether or not the property can be divided without materially impairing its value, but where it does not affirmatively appear in the record that the court passed upon the question in ordering sale of a large number of platted lots in bulk, it was error, but did not render the judgment void; since the lots did not bring enough to pay plaintiff’s debt, interest, and costs, it may be presumed that the owner lost nothing by the error.

     Procedure in action to enforce lien where other liens exist against real property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The plaintiff in an action to enforce a lien on real property shall state in his petition the liens, if any, which are held thereon by others, and make the holders defendants; and no sale of the property shall be ordered by the court prejudicial to the rights of the holders of any of the liens, and when it appears from the petition or otherwise, that several debts are secured by one (1) lien, or by liens of equal rank, and they are all due at the commencement of the action, or become so before judgment, the court shall order the sale for the pro rata satisfaction of all of them, but if, in such case, the debts be owned by different persons and be not all due, the court shall not order a sale of the property until they all mature. If all such liens be held by the same party, the court may order a sale of enough of the property to pay the debts then due, unless it appear that it is not susceptible of advantageous division, or that, for some other reason, the sale would cause a sacrifice thereof, or seriously prejudice the interests of the defendants, but the holder of a prior lien may enforce the same when the debt thereby secured is due, notwithstanding the existence of inferior liens, whether the debts secured thereby are due or not; and the holder of an inferior lien, when the debt thereby secured is due, may enforce the same by a sale of land subject to a prior lien or liens thereon, where the debt or debts secured thereby are not yet due. Provided, that the provisions of this section shall not apply to any liens now of record.

        In an action to foreclose a vendor’s lien securing two notes, both owned by the plaintiff, one of which was not due, instead of ordering a sale of all or part of the land to satisfy a part only of the plaintiff’s debts, reserving a lien and consequent encumbrance on the land in his favor for the residue of the indebtedness, the court should have simply directed a sale of enough of the land to pay the debts and costs then adjudged, leaving the remaining note to its lien on the remaining portion of the land.

        Where real estate is sold to enforce a junior lien, the thing that is sold is the debtor’s equity in the realty, subject to the prior lien; the property must be appraised as a whole and the purchaser, in order to cut off the debtor’s right of redemption and obtain a deed, must bid at least two thirds of the value of the debtor’s equity as computed by deducting the amount of the prior lien from the total appraised value.

        Trial court improperly confirmed a judicial sale without making it subject to a senior mortgage because, while an assignee and its predecessor failed to bring their claim in the foreclosure proceedings initiated by a junior mortgagee and therefore had a default judgment entered against them, the assignee’s presentation of its claim prior to the judicial sale was sufficient to prevent its senior mortgage from being extinguished by the junior mortgagee’s foreclosure action.

        Where a bank had made a loan and the principal had executed a mortgage to his surety to indemnify him and as security for a separate loan from the surety, the bank’s judgment for sale of the principal’s mortgaged land was improper where the representatives of the deceased surety were not made parties to the action.

        When it developed, in an action to set aside deeds and ordering land sold, that there were outstanding liens on the property, the court should have required these lienholders to be made parties before ordering a sale in order that their rights might be protected, and the judgment was erroneous to the extent that it ignored their rights.

        The interest of a pendente lite lienholder in real property does not survive the judicial sale of the property incident to a foreclosure action to which the lienholder was neither a party nor had actual notice of the proceedings. While this section clearly requires the plaintiff in a foreclosure action to name the holders of other liens in its petition, there is no statutory requirement to name those who acquire a lien after the filing of the petition.

        Circuit court properly denied a judgment debtor's motion, corrected a clerical error regarding judgment interest, and granted a judgment and order of sale to enforce an estate's judgment lien against the debtor's real property because the statute clearly contemplated the judicial sale of the real property subject to a judgment lien, upon filing a notice of judgment lien in the county clerk's office, the lien automatically attached to all real property owned by the debtor in the county where filed, and the alleged deficiencies in the judgment lien notice were merely a matter of form, not content.

        Judgment creditor was entitled to summary judgment in a bankruptcy debtor’s adversary proceeding because, even under the strict compliance requirement, the judgment lien was valid and enforceable since it met the statutory requirements, notwithstanding the misidentification of the identity of a judgment creditor, which was trivial and did not rising to the level necessary to affect the perfection of the judgment lien nor notice of the same, and an order was entered in the main bankruptcy case that the named creditor was not a creditor of the debtor, that she was not the judgment creditor, and that she had no standing to file the judgment lien on her own behalf.

        Denial of a judgment creditor’s motion for summary judgment and confirmation of a foreign judgment from Nova Scotia in Kentucky was appropriate because the factors determining personal jurisdiction in Nova Scotia weighed more heavily in favor of the judgment debtor. The judgment debtor executed the promissory notes in the United States, never set foot in Nova Scotia, and did not do business in Nova Scotia, while any evidence regarding the execution of the notes seemed to be in the United States.

       <p>
        Subsection (4) of this section is not unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. In re Roehrig, 36 B.R. 505, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 5246 (Bankr. W.D.
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. 1983
        </cite>
        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        Debtor’s claim that the retroactive applicability of subsection (4) of this section was a taking of property without due process of law was without merit, where under the applicable state law the household goods in question were not exempt at the time the lien was created on May 16, 1979, nor were they exempt pursuant to the state’s statutory exemption scheme on May 3, 1983, when the debtor’s petition in bankruptcy was filed. In re Roehrig, 36 B.R. 505, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 5246 (Bankr. W.D.
        <cite class="ky_code">

        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (4) of this section, which denies to debtors bankruptcy exemptions in property subject to consensual liens, clearly lies beyond any of the 29 enumerated types of “special legislation” specifically prohibited by Ky. Const., § 59 and is therefore “general legislation” well within the province of the Legislature to enact. In re Bennett, 36 B.R. 893, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 6282 (Bankr. W.D.

        KRS 427.010(2)(a) was a Kentucky garnishment statute, limited to pre-bankruptcy actions by creditors; once debtor filed her bankruptcy petition, KRS 427.010(2) did not protect her post-petition federal tax refund from the trustee’s reach. Thus, debtor could not claim an exemption for her 2003 tax refund under the statute. 2004 Bankr. LEXIS 1350.

        KRS 427.010(2)(a) was virtually identical to the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA), 15 USCS §§ 1671-77, which was meant to prevent bankruptcies, not to function within the bankruptcy process, and there was no reason to believe that the General Assembly intended KRS 427.010(2) to be read differently than the CCPA, upon which it was clearly modeled. Absent a showing of the General Assembly’s intent to allow KRS 427.010(2) to continue in the bankruptcy process, debtor could not utilize the garnishment statute to protect her post-petition federal income tax refund from the trustee’s reach. 2004 Bankr.

        Husband’s claim pursuant to KRS 427.010(2)(a) that money owed to the husband’s medical practice was largely exempt from the wife’s garnishment action was more properly considered under KRS 427.005(1), which provided the definition of “earnings” that were subject to exemption. The husband did not prove that the money at issue constituted “earnings” because the husband did not show what part of that money was generated through the husband’s personal efforts. Mickler v.

        Since the Commonwealth has chosen to opt out of the federal list of exemptions entirely, the district court has to look to this section, to determine whether the debtor is entitled to an exemption before 11 USCS § 522(f) can be applied. Commercial Credit Corp. v. Brooks, 71 B.R. 6 (W.D.

        The Legislature, in enacting this section, was balancing the need to protect the homesteads of debtors in trouble against the need to insure a ready supply of credit to the general population for the acquisition of homesteads; therefore, this section is not at odds with the Bankruptcy Code. Commercial Credit Corp. v. Brooks, 71 B.R. 6 (W.D.

        Kentucky homestead exemption was available to eligible debtors at the time a petition under the Bankruptcy Code was filed where there was no pending sale of the residence; therefore, debtors were entitled to have their motions to avoid the judicial liens of the respective creditors avoided to the extent that the liens impair these valid homestead exemptions. In re Powell, 173 B.R. 338, 1994 Bankr. LEXIS 1634 (Bankr. E.D.
        <cite class="ky_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        Under Kentucky law the homestead exemption provided for by this section is an absolute exemption available to an individual debtor upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case; motion of debtor pursuant to 11 USCS § 522(f)(1) to avoid judicial liens as liens that impair his homestead exemption was sustained. In re Lynch, 187 B.R. 536, 1995 Bankr. LEXIS 1368 (Bankr. E.D.

        Where debtors’ Chapter 13 plan contained a provision to avoid a judicial lien, and the debtors never filed a motion to avoid such lien, but in turn, the creditor never made a timely objection to the plan provision as required by E.D. Ky. Bankr. R. 3015-3(a)(1), regardless of the procedural irregularities, the bankruptcy court exercised its discretion and held that the lien could not be avoided because the lien did not impair the debtors’ homestead exemption pursuant to KRS

        If widow elects to take dower in lieu of homestead, the homestead right of the infant children follows and attaches to the dower. In re Gibson, 33 F. Supp. 838, 1940 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2940 (D.

        The widow of bankrupt had the right, upon his death, to elect whether to claim the exempt proceeds derived from sale of his homestead or her right to dower in the land, but her election to receive dower precluded her right to claim exemption in the proceeds.

        This section does not restrict “any money or other benefit to be paid
        . . . . . ” as exemptible only upon death but rather it denotes an exemption extending to the debtor on any monetary value or benefits accruing by virtue of ownership. Thus, the loan values or the cash surrender values of life insurance policies by virtue of the enactment of the legislature have been deemed exempt under this section since the term “any money
        . . . . .
        to be paid” is not restricted as to time of election and offers no alternative but to include the cash surrender value within its definition. In re Worthington, 28 B.R. 736, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 6649 (Bankr. W.D.

        Based upon the principle that a child support obligation is not to be considered as an ordinary contractual debt, but a moral obligation imposed by the state, and that the policy of KRS Chapter 67A is to provide benefits for the fund’s member as well as his or her dependents, such benefits may be subject to attachment, assignment, or garnishment for purposes of enforcing a child support order.

        It was Congress’s intent to foreclose all non-federal regulation of ERISA-qualified plans, except for some very limited, explicitly described exceptions; therefore, no provision of this section may be utilized to circumvent or otherwise diminish the operation of the anti-alienation provisions of ERISA.

       <p>
        When the Kentucky Legislature enacted this section, its inclusion of the words, “similar plan or contract” simply evidenced legislative intent not to restrict exempt status to only those arrangements specifically enumerated within the statute, and the provisions of this section are entitled to an expansive reading. In re Peklenk, 106 B.R. 119, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 1755 (Bankr. W.D.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislature in enacting this section did not intend to restrict exempt status to only those arrangements expressly set forth therein, since it recognized the existence of other sophisticated benefit systems regardless of their generic term under the all-encompassing phrase “similar plan or contract” in subdivision (1)(b). To be thus included the similar plan or contract must possess the characteristics of those programs expressly stated or be so parallel in nature as to serve the same goals or purposes. In re Worthington, 28 B.R. 736, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 6649 (Bankr. W.D.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The sophistication of deferred compensation plans and programs precludes an exhaustive identification of such arrangements, and thus, the phrase “similar plan or contract” in subdivision (1)(b) must by its adoption include those plans closely parallel in nature to the specifics named. It is well recognized that Individual Retirement Account (IRA) accounts do possess these traits in that benefits through contributions of a tax-deferred nature do flow to the debtor and his dependents under a formalized plan conditioned upon certain prospective elections or future events, and mandating that such accounts to be deemed a qualified plan must adhere to rigid requirements monitored by the Internal Revenue Service. In re Worthington, 28 B.R. 736, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 6649 (Bankr. W.D.

       <p>
        An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a “similar plan or contract” under subdivision (1)(b) of this section; accordingly, in a bankruptcy action the cash value of the bankrupt debtor’s IRA account was exempt under subdivision (1)(b).

        To determine if the reasonably necessary test has been met, the court must examine all of the facts and circumstances including the debtor’s age, earning capacity, present and future financial needs, ability to insure against future disruptions in earning capacity, and his ability to reestablish a retirement fund. In re Slezak, 63 B.R. 625, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 5556 (Bankr. W.D.
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. 1986

        The amount claimed exempt, $69,073, was reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and his dependents upon his retirement, illness or disability, where at age 61, the debtor in all probability did not have but a few more years to practice medicine, and the debtor, a physician was in bankruptcy after over 25 years of practice. In re Fisher, 63 B.R. 649, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 5533 (Bankr. W.D.

        The burden was upon bankruptcy trustee to establish by proof that all of the $14,000 settlement with the insurer received by the individual who sustained a 40% permanent partial functional disability and incurred medical bills of over $50,000 as the result of a motorcycle accident was on account of personal injury rather than the various other causes of action making up a personal injury action, and since under the facts in the action, it was impossible for the trustee to sustain that burden, his objection to the exemption of all $14,000 would be overruled. In re Blizard, 81 B.R. 431, 1988 Bankr. LEXIS 59 (Bankr. W.D.

        Debtors were not precluded from claiming an exemption for any part of their personal injury settlement merely because debtor’s whole source of income was government assistance; fact that debtors had no jobs did not mean that settlement of their personal injury claims lacked any future earnings component.

        Trustee had the burden of proving that the debtor could not take a claimed exemption for an annuity that the debtor received as part of a settlement for a personal injury lawsuit, and absent proof to the contrary the debtor was entitled to take a deduction of $57,500 for future lost wages, pursuant to KRS 427.150(2)(d).

        Where a settlement agreement specifically stated that payments made to debtor (then plaintiff) constituted damages for personal injuries, debtor’s monthly annuity payments were not exempt under KRS 427.150(2) as payments for lost future earnings even though debtor released her claims for lost future earnings as part of the settlement; the parties specifically agreed to treatment of the payments as damages for personal injuries for tax purposes, and the unambiguous language of the agreement prevailed over later credible testimony about the “underlying meanings” of the agreement.

        Where the settlement clearly stated that the payments were on account of “personal physical injuries,” and the court could not find that it covered future lost wages when a plain reading of the document gave no such indication, the post-petition annuity payments were exempt up to $7,500 under KRS 427.150(2)(c), but the annuity payments in excess of $7,500 were not exempt under KRS 427.150(2)(d) because they were on account of personal injuries and not future lost wages.

        Husband was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his order for a non-wage garnishment of the wife’s spousal maintenance to pay the debt owed by the parties to the husband’s parents; the family court did not need to reach the issue of whether the maintenance was subject to exemption because the proper method to enforce the debt was for the husband or parents to obtain a separate judgment or collect the debt by a separate lawsuit.

     Grain storage receipt or scale ticket as prima facie claim of right to possession.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A claimant’s production to a bankruptcy court of a grain storage receipt or scale ticket as evidence of ownership of a quantity of grain held by the trustee shall be sufficient to establish a prima facie claim of right to possession in such claimant of the quantity, quality, and type of grain specified in such document. In any case where a claimant has placed the original of such document on deposit with any party as collateral for a loan, an affidavit from such party verifying ownership of such receipt or scale ticket by the claimant shall be sufficient to establish a prima facie claim of right to possession in such claimant.
