       Subdivision (9) of this section explicitly provides that the turnpike authority may designate the locations and establish, limit and control such points of ingress to and egress from each turnpike project “as the authority and the bureau (department of highways) may determine to be necessary.” It is obvious that subdivision (9) was designed to utilize the best thinking and planning of the turnpike authority and the administrative and technical engineering talent of the department of highways; thus, a view that the turnpike authority enjoys a basic autonomy in this context is incorrect and unrealistic.

       Under subdivision (9) of this section, the turnpike authority, acting in concert with the department of highways, has the authority to grant additional access points on a turnpike. However, such a decision, as a sound exercise of discretion, must be on a case-by-case basis, and be based upon the general public’s best interest in terms of peace, health, safety, convenience, and general and economic welfare; such a decision for additional access points must be subject to available funding of construction and maintenance, and must in no way compromise or lessen in any way the rights of bondholders involved in the original turnpike construction.

       The authority is authorized to provide, at one (1) time or from time to time, for the issuance of its turnpike revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any one (1) or more turnpike projects undertaken pursuant to an agreement and lease. The principal of and the interest on the bonds shall be payable solely from the funds provided for the payment. The bonds of any issue may be in one (1) or more series and any one (1) or more series may enjoy equal or subordinate status with respect to the pledge of funds from which they are payable, shall be dated, shall bear interest at a rate or rates or method of determining rates, shall mature at a time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, all as may be provided by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at a price or prices and under terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached to the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places for payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority, and the seal of the authority or a facsimile of the seal shall be affixed to the bonds and attested by the manual signature of the secretary of the authority, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until delivery of the bonds. All bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The authority may sell the bonds in a manner, either at public or private sale, and for a price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.

If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than the cost, additional bonds may be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture securing the bonds, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund or funds for the bonds or any account or accounts as the authority shall have provided in the proceedings or trust indenture authorizing and securing the bonds.

The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this chapter without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things, except as specifically required by this chapter.

     Trust indenture to secure bonds — Rights and remedies of bondholders.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the discretion of the authority, any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the Commonwealth. Such trust indenture or the proceedings providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the tolls and other revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage any turnpike project or any part thereof. Such trust indenture or proceedings may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of the turnpike project or projects in connection with which such bonds shall have been authorized, the rates of toll or the rentals to be charged, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Any such trust indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust indenture or proceedings may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust indenture or proceedings may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the turnpike project or projects.

      Under this section, when the bonds and interest are completely paid, as relates to the Mountain Parkway and Mountain Parkway Extension, if those roads are found by the Transportation Cabinet to be in good condition and repair, the Turnpike Authority must then convey the toll roads to the commonwealth, and they shall become part of the State Highway System and shall thereafter be maintained by the Transportation Cabinet free of tolls. However, if, at the time the bonds and interest are fully paid, the Transportation Cabinet finds that the toll roads are not in good condition and repair, the tolls should be retained for a reasonable period, during which time the Cabinet will restore the toll roads to good condition and repair.

     Legislative findings.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky determines as a legislative finding of fact that the economy of the Commonwealth is, to a major degree, dependent upon the severance and production of coal, which is the most abundant and valuable mineral resource of Kentucky; that there is a serious shortage of transportation facilities for the transportation of coal from mines to market; that many of the roads, bridges and highways situated in the coal-producing areas of the Commonwealth are obsolete and inadequate for the uses to which they are subjected, and have, in many cases deteriorated to the point where their use is hazardous and represents a potential threat to the safety and welfare of the traveling public; and that the shortage of modern, heavy-duty road systems in such areas is seriously retarding the continued economic growth of the Commonwealth. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky further determines as a legislative finding of fact that the construction and financing of resource recovery roads through the Turnpike Authority of Kentucky utilizing coal severance tax allocations for the amortization of resource recovery road revenue bonds issued to provide funds to construct such roads will preserve and enhance the economic viability of the Commonwealth, will protect and enhance the safety, health, convenience and general welfare of the traveling public, and will therefore constitute the performance of essential governmental and public purposes.

     <p>
      The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky determines as a legislative finding of fact that the economy of the Commonwealth and the consequent economic development potential of the citizens of the Commonwealth are vitally dependent upon the existence and availability of a statewide system of safe, adequate and well-maintained highways, roads and thoroughfares; that there is a serious need for construction, reconstruction, and in some cases relocation of many such highways, roads and thoroughfares to preserve and enhance the economic well-being and development of the Commonwealth and the health and safety of the public; and that in many cases, highways, roads and thoroughfares which are vital economic links between various sections of the Commonwealth have become, by reason of age and continued usage obsolete and are no longer capable of affording the services required in a modern industrial society. The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky further determines as a legislative finding of fact that the construction, reconstruction, and relocation of a system of such economic development roads through the Turnpike Authority of Kentucky will preserve and enhance the economic viability of the Commonwealth, will enable the Commonwealth to prosper and make available its economic potentials to the fullest possible degree, will protect and enhance the safety, health, convenience and welfare of the traveling public and will therefore constitute the performance of essential governmental and public purposes.

        As no statute, regulation, or case law imposed a duty on the Kentucky Department of Highways (KDH) to the general public or to adjoining landowners to remove defective trees, its failure to remove a dead tree on KDH-owned property was not a “ministerial act” as that term is used in KRS 44.073(2). Therefore, a homeowner’s claim against the KDH for damage to his property caused by a fallen tree was barred by sovereign immunity. Commonwealth v. Sexton, 256 S.W.3d 29, 2008

       <p>
        The Department of Transportation (now Transportation Cabinet) cannot use the “turnkey” method for bidding highway construction projects since there is nothing in the road building chapters of the KRS which would authorize the use of such method and to do so would ignore the public policy embodied in this section of obtaining the most qualified and competent engineering services at the lowest possible price because this section requires in effect that the engineer’s plans and specifications be completed before the Bureau of Highways may advertise for bids.

      The Department of Highways may cause any road construction or reconstruction to be done by employees of the department instead of through contractors when, in the opinion of the commissioner as expressed in an official order, any of the following conditions is found to exist:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="tXVc176s176.121ol11">
       Emergency construction or reconstruction is made necessary by the fact that a road has been rendered unusable or the urgency of need for construction or reconstruction is apparent.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVc176s176.121ol12">
       Construction or reconstruction of access roads would serve as an inducement to industrial location or substantial expansion of industry, and the estimated cost of the project is less than one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000).
      </li>
      <li id="tXVc176s176.121ol13">
       The project involves: an existing road and provides for such work as improvement of sight distance, traffic marking, channelization or the addition or widening of traffic lanes or widening of shoulders; or construction, reconstruction, widening or strengthening of small bridges and projects for which preparation of detailed plans required to secure bids is unnecessary; or an emergency need does not allow for time for preparation of plans and advertisement for bids.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVc176s176.121ol14">
       No satisfactory bid is received for the construction or reconstruction of the road after all necessary steps have been taken to obtain bids for such work, and the estimated cost of the projects is less than one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000).

      If any county desires to construct any part of a public road before the state is prepared to construct it, such county shall ask the department for permission to do so. When such request is made the department shall immediately investigate the request, and if they find that the county has funds available to construct such road and will pay for the construction thereof, the department may take up the construction of such road, as soon as the county has taken such steps as the department requires to make available subject to its order sufficient funds to pay for the construction of the road. When the county has satisfied these requirements, the department may proceed to construct the road in the same way and under the same regulations that it constructs other roads. The department shall keep careful account of the money advanced by the county to the state, and when the project of which the road is a part has been completed, the state shall refund to the county the money advanced upon proper certification of the department, if the road is to be accepted by the commissioner of highways as a part of the state primary road system.

        Where the land is condemned for road purposes, the measure of damages, in the absence of additional fencing or other improvements made necessary by the taking, is the reasonable market value of the strip of land taken, considered in relation to the entire tract, and also the diminution in the reasonable market value of the remainder of the tract directly resulting by reason of the situation and shape in which it is placed by the taking of said strip, but not exceeding in all the difference between the market value of the whole tract immediately before and the reasonable market value of the remainder immediately after the taking, deducting from both estimates any enhancement of the value of the remainder by reason of the building and use of the road.

        Oral agreement regarding right-of-way made with property owner by county judge (now county judge/executive), county attorney, justices of the peace and county road engineer does not constitute a contract binding on the county, as a county cannot contract except through its fiscal court acting as a body.

        Representatives of county, in negotiating for right-of-way, would have no authority to make oral agreement that highway would be constructed on designated part of right-of-way, or that additional payment would be made if highway was not constructed according to conditions specified by landowner, since statute requires that right-of-way agreements be approved by county attorney and fiscal court and entered on the records.

        Where operator of a residential subdivision, after obtaining grant of easement from state Department of Highways, had constructed a water pipeline along south side of state highway, he was entitled, in condemnation proceeding brought by state in connection with proposed reconstruction and widening of highway, to an award of damages equal to cost of relocating his pipeline on the north side of the highway, which was made necessary by the proposed reconstruction. In such case, where it was proved that 3,000 feet of pipe would have to be relocated in order to make the pipeline function, condemnee was entitled to an award based on the cost of relocating 3,000 feet, although only 652 feet were within the condemned area.

        A county attorney should not engage in negotiations relating to state highway rights-of-way located in his county nor condemnation cases arising in his county even though he was retained prior to assuming office, but he may represent private parties involved in condemnation proceedings in other counties since his statutory obligations as county attorney do not extend to other counties.

      , a limited access facility is defined as a highway or street especially designed for through traffic, and over, from or to which owners or occupants of abutting land or other persons have no right or easement or only a limited right or easement of access, light, air, or view by reason of the fact that their property abuts upon such limited access facility or for any other reason. Such highways or streets may be parkways, from which trucks, buses, and other commercial vehicles shall be excluded; or they may be freeways open to use by all customary forms of street and highway traffic.

       Under KRS 175.450(9), the turnpike authority, acting in concert with the department of highways, has the authority to grant additional access points on a turnpike. However, such a decision, as a sound exercise of discretion, must be on a case-by-case basis, and be based upon the general public’s best interest in terms of peace, health, safety, convenience, and general and economic welfare; such a decision for additional access points must be subject to available funding of construction and maintenance, and must in no way compromise or lessen in any way the rights of bondholders involved in the original turnpike construction.

       Where county fiscal court designated several county roads for repair under the Rural Secondary Road Fund and subsequently the state conferred with party patrons in the county and proceeded to change the list of county roads to be repaired and began repairing county roads without ever seeking or receiving authorization from the fiscal court, the state’s action was legal since the fiscal court was given a chance to recommend as to the project, but the Department of Rural Aid could not agree with the fiscal court.

       “County Roads” are public roads which have been formally accepted by the fiscal court of the county as a part of the county road system.

       Under the statutory definitions, a “secondary and rural” road for purposes of fund distribution by the state, under subsection (1) of this section, may include a “county road,” as well as a “secondary and rural road.” However, a “county road,” for purposes of fund distribution, under subsection (2) of this section, can only be a road meeting the definition of KRS 178.010(1)(b).

       A county cannot maintain a road not shown on a county road aid map (County Road Series Map) adopted by the fiscal court, unless such road was entitled to acceptance as a part of the county road system, and has been so accepted by the fiscal court; it is a rebuttable presumption that a road not shown on a County Road Series Map that has been formally adopted for a county, is not a “county road” within the meaning of KRS 178.010(1)(b).

      Since § 230 of the Constitution clearly restricts the use of money derived from taxes on gasoline for highway purposes, any legislation directing the money to be used otherwise would be unconstitutional, and broadening a definition of the word “maintenance” to include any activity or project that would decrease cost and expenditures of repair on urban streets and highways would not surmount the constitutional barrier.

      The funds received by the city under the municipal aid program are subject to the general mandate of Const., § 230 concerning road expenditures; KRS 177.369(2) further limits permissible expenditures of such funds to only the “purpose of construction, reconstruction and maintenance of urban roads and streets set forth in this section”; therefore, since a parking lot is not within the definition of “streets,” the city cannot expend its municipal aid funds to pave a public parking lot.

      Where a city receives funds disbursed by the state from various road use taxes and received by the city pursuant to this section, and the city places these funds in an interest-bearing special road fund account, the interest derived therefrom must be applied to the road-related purposes set forth in KRS

      since Const., § 230 mandates this and since subsection (2) of this section narrowly restricts expenditures for the construction, reconstruction and maintenance of urban roads and streets.

      The funds received by the city under the municipal aid program are subject to the general mandate of Const., § 230 concerning road expenditures; subsection (2) of this section further limits permissible expenditures of such funds to only the “purpose of construction, reconstruction and maintenance of urban roads and streets set forth in KRS

      ”; therefore, since a parking lot is not within the definition of “streets,” the city cannot expend its municipal aid funds to pave a public parking lot.

      The city may not use portions of its municipal aid funds to pay the utility expenses for the operation of its street lighting system; paying the utility bills from the municipal aid funds would go beyond the physical maintenance of the street lighting system.

      Since the sidewalk is generally considered to be part of the street, a city may expend portions of its municipal aid funds to construct, maintain and repair sidewalks and be within the statutory requirement that such funds be spent to construct and maintain its streets.

        The Billboard Advertising Act is not unconstitutional as a retroactive or retrospective act since it does not affect or impair rights existing prior to the date of its enactment nor is it unconstitutional as an ex post facto act since it does not impose a criminal penalty upon any person for any prior act and it is not an arbitrary exercise of state police power.

        The Billboard Act and regulations are content neutral since they are not directed at the content of the messages, but at their secondary effects, and they apply evenhandedly to commercial and noncommercial speech.

        The interest in promoting the recreational value of public travel and preserving natural beauty along interstate highways is substantial and sufficient to support the content neutral restrictions of the Billboard Act, these restrictions are narrowly tailored to achieve this interest, and these restrictions leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information; therefore, the Billboard Act does not violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.Wheeler v.

        , summary judgment was properly granted in favor of defendant, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, Department of Highways, because plaintiffs failed to obtain a permit for their billboards containing religious messages and the signs were thus subject to removal as public nuisances due to the lack of a permit. While plaintiffs had a right to express and share their religion with the motoring public, the Commonwealth of Kentucky had a right to place reasonable restrictions on the place and manner that message is conveyed, particularly when aimed at protecting public safety and preserving the public environment; government acts often inadvertently frustrate certain citizens’
        search for spiritual fulfillment, yet the government simply could not operate if it was required to satisfy every citizen’s religious needs and desires. Harston v. Commonwealth Transp. Cabinet, 2011

        Regulations of Transportation Cabinet governing lighted message boards which prohibited commercial speech but allowed time, date, temperature or weather information to be displayed were substantially broader than necessary to protect the governmental interests of highway safety and aesthetics. Cabinet failed to demonstrate a reasonable connection between the requirements of highway safety and aesthetics and had not narrowly tailored the regulation to achieve any desired objectives and therefore developed an unconstitutional regulation on commercial free speech as well as upon noncommercial free speech because the state had chosen to allow some noncommercial messages to be displayed.

        , summary judgment was properly granted in favor of defendant, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, Department of Highways, because plaintiffs failed to obtain a permit for their billboards containing religious messages and the signs were thus subject to removal as public nuisances due to the lack of a permit. While plaintiffs had a right to express and share their religion with the motoring public, the Commonwealth of Kentucky had a right to place reasonable restrictions on the place and manner that message is conveyed, particularly when aimed at protecting public safety and preserving the public environment; government acts often inadvertently frustrate certain citizens’
        search for spiritual fulfillment, yet the government simply could not operate if it was required to satisfy every citizen’s religious needs and desires. Harston v. Commonwealth Transp. Cabinet, 2011

        Because of the express prohibition set out in subsection (1), the state does not have the authority to issue regulations allowing advertising within the so-called “Cotton areas,” i.e., areas within 660 feet of the interstate highway right-of-way.

        , it does not appear that KRS 177.865(2) was meant to carve out an exemption to the prohibitions on advertising set forth in this section; rather, it was simply a part of the legislation to allow certain advertising devices within the highway rights-of-way to provide directional information for establishments offering goods and services to the traveling public.

        The Kentucky General Assembly specifically expressed its intent concerning the “Cotton areas” (areas within 660 feet of the interstate highway right-of-way) when it enacted subdivision (1) of this section and expressly prohibited the erection or maintenance of advertising devices within the “Cotton areas” and the fact that the Kentucky General Assembly did not mention the element of time of acquisition of rights-of-way indicates that it intended to prohibit such advertising regardless of when such rights-of-way were acquired.

        Regulations of Transportation Cabinet governing lighted message boards which prohibited commercial speech but allowed time, date, temperature or weather information to be displayed were substantially broader than necessary to protect the governmental interests of highway safety and aesthetics. Cabinet failed to demonstrate a reasonable connection between the requirements of highway safety and aesthetics and had not narrowly tailored the regulation to achieve any desired objectives and therefore developed an unconstitutional regulation on commercial free speech as well as upon noncommercial free speech because the state had chosen to allow some noncommercial messages to be displayed. Injunction against travel plaza’s lighted message board was reversed. Flying J Travel Plaza v. Transportation Cabinet, Dep't of Highways, 928 S.W.2d 344, 1996

        A junkyard or recycling establishment, as defined in this section, found within the city limits and located closer than 1000 feet to the center line of any street which is part of any county, state or federal limited access highway or turnpike, is subject to the state statutes requiring a permit for the operation of such an establishment; establishments not subject to state regulation may be regulated by the city under its police power but it is doubtful that the city can prohibit entirely the operation of junkyards within the city limits as they are not normally considered to be nuisances per se.

        The state’s authority relating to the issuing of permits for junkyards located closer than 1000 feet to the center line of any road would not include those areas involving city streets that were not a part of any county, state or federal highway system; a city of the fifth class, under its general police power, could then regulate, inspect and issue licenses for the operation of those junkyards or recycling establishments within the corporate limits not coming under the coverage of the state act or which fell within the exception referred to in KRS

        A public road may be established only in the manner provided by statute, or by dedication to the public use and acceptance by the proper authorities as a public road. Neither dedication nor acceptance need be formal, and both can be presumed from continual use by the public for 15 years or more, accompanied by acts of control on the part of the county court; but mere use, without the exercise of control by the county court, is not sufficient.

        Where a certain roadway served no useful purpose except to serve as an access road to two private homes which had not been inhabited for a number of years, the road was not “public” and the order of the county fiscal court finding it to be a “public road” and making it a county road on the condition that adjoining landowners execute right-of-way deeds, in the absence of such deeds, was invalid.

        Although a county had constructed and maintained a private road for nearly 30 years, the lack of public use prevented the county from acquiring the road by prescription. Perry v. Powell County, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22633 (E.D. Ky. Dec. 11, 2000).

       <p>
        Public road may be acquired by prescription only upon: (1) 15 years public use; and (2) a like number of years of control and maintenance by the government. Maintenance of the road, standing alone, will not constitute a public user capable of ripening into a prescriptive title. The County also must show that the use was adverse rather than permissive, open, continuous, and so manifest as to afford notice to an ordinarily prudent owner. Perry v. Powell County, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22633 (E.D. Ky. Dec. 11, 2000).

        Where an old county road is fenced or blocked off by adjacent property owners, if it is determined that the county accepted the road as a county road, then the fiscal court can either abandon it by a formal order or it may improve the road and take legal steps to eliminate the fencing and blocking off activities of adjacent property owners, depending upon what is felt to be in the best interests of the county as a whole. If the fiscal court never “accepted” the road formally, or informally prior to 1914, as a county road, and the fiscal court does not deem it to be in the public interest to now formally accept it as a county road, then it would appear that the fiscal court has no further responsibility nor interest in the controversy.

        Generally, a fiscal court has no authority to use county road equipment and crews on city streets, except where the city street segment has been made a part of the county road system for purposes of construction, maintenance, or repair; thus, a fiscal court may contribute to the maintenance or construction of a city street if it so elects by making such street a county through road; however, such county action is permissive only.

        Since a county cannot furnish county equipment and road employees to maintain or construct a city street unless such street is made a part of the county road system, the mere fact that an interlocal agreement is being entered into that does not encompass the city street’s being made a part of the county road system would not convert it into a lawful project.

        If the fiscal court had never entered a formal order accepting a road as a part of the county road system and had never acquired the easement or title to the road by instrument or user, it was not a “county road,” as defined in subdivision (1)(b) of this section. However, if the fiscal court had entered a formal order of acceptance and if the public user had ripened into a prescriptive easement for 15 years, it was a “county road.”

        The fiscal court can “establish” a road or strip of land as a part of the county road system prior to obtaining easements or title from the owners. However, the fiscal court cannot start road work on the land in question until the owner has received or been tendered compensation; the fiscal court must either pay the owners for the land to be used for the county road or must tender the compensation prior to the county’s going on the land and beginning the road work.

        Establishment of a public road as a “county road” occurs when a public road is accepted by the fiscal court as part of the county road system, irrespective of when such road was built or originated, thus it follows that a public road “accepted by a fiscal court into the county road system” after the effective date of Acts 1964, ch. 68 § 1 (June 18, 1964), must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet.

        A county cannot maintain a road not shown on a county road aid map (County Road Series Map) adopted by the fiscal court, unless such road was entitled to acceptance as a part of the county road system, and has been so accepted by the fiscal court; it is a rebuttable presumption that a road not shown on a County Road Series Map that has been formally adopted for a county, is not a “county road” within the meaning of subsection (1)(b) of this section.

        Where tract of land outside of town’s boundary was divided into lots and streets and plat was filed with county clerk and streets were outlined by plotted furrows at time of public auction of the lots, although streets dedicated in such a manner cannot be regarded as public roads in the sense that they become part of the county’s road system which must be maintained within the meaning of the statute, for they were never legally accepted or established as such, they were and are public roads in the sense that the dedication inured to the benefit of the public, and the public, particularly contiguous property owners, had a right to use them and such right cannot be destroyed by mere encroachment of the owner of the abutting property.

        Where county road passing through lands of several adjoining landowners, near a creek, was no longer used by public because, in reconstruction of road as a state highway, a new right-of-way was established through such lands, but one landowner continued to use old road through neighbor’s land in order to reach a bridge which gave him access to his land on the other side of the creek, the court, in an action by the neighbor to enjoin such use, correctly refused an injunction on the ground that the old road had not been legally discontinued, and in giving such judgment the court was not required to grant plaintiff’s alternative plea that the defendant be required to remove obstructions placed by him across the road near the point of intersection with the new right-of-way, and that it be adjudged that the old road was still a public road.

        Where county, in 1892 or prior thereto, closed part of road and abandoned the rest, opening a new road to serve the same public, there was a sufficient closing of the road so that a judgment in a suit between adjoining landowners, permitting one to erect a gate across the road, was valid and binding on their successors in title, although county was not party to suit.

        Where subsection (2) of this section, governing highway rights-of-way, was not enacted until 44 years after electric lines were constructed, and the legislature did not expressly direct that the statute should be retroactively applied, the court could not apply subsection (2), in order to determine whether lines were in right-of-way, without violating KRS 446.080(3), which prohibits the retroactive application of statutes.

        Where there was no adequate record as to the width of the right-of-way of highway in 1922 when electric lines were first constructed, the statute then in effect, under which the lines were not in the right-of-way, governed the parties’ rights, and, since the bureau of highways failed to prove that the electric lines were originally constructed within public right-of-way, the bureau, and not the utility, was responsible for costs of moving lines to improve highway.

        The trial court’s findings that public right-of-way had always been considered to extend to the fences along roads, that subsection (2) of this section had merely codified the rule, and thus, that electric lines constructed prior to enactment of statute were originally constructed on public right-of-way, were clearly erroneous since no authorities recognize the presumption set forth in subsection (2) of this section as a substantive rule, and since former statute in effect at time of construction of the electric lines did not either expressly or by implication create a presumption that all property between a road and the fence lines adjoining it was part of the public right-of-way.

        While the general public may have abandoned the public use of the road, the parties to this action, and the property owners whose lands adjoin the road, have not. The prescriptive easement for public use necessarily subsumed the private prescriptive use of the same road by the owners of the properties adjoining it. As to those property owners, the prescriptive easement survives. Jameison v. Eagle Rod &amp; Gun Club, Inc., 2007

        This section is unrelated to the 15-year prescriptive easement rule; it merely provides in effect that any road dedicated by the owner or owners of the property as a public way and used by the general public without restrictions for five consecutive years shall conclusively be presumed to be a public road. Therefore, this section has no application where there is no record of any owner dedication.

        A road which had been used by the public and maintained by the county government for at least 14 years could be presumed to be a “public road,” provided it met the tests laid out in this section; however, unless the fiscal court formally accepted the road as a “county road,” it did not become a “county road” and, if it was to become formally a “county road,” the minimal width requirement of KRS 178.040(2) had to be complied with.

        The discontinuance of a public road, which is not a county road, as defined by KRS 178.010(1)(b), requires no formal action of the fiscal court; the fact that the county once maintained it is not controlling.

        A public road that is not a county road can be abandoned without formal action of the fiscal court, and a reverter to former owners would occur, Williams v. Woodward, 240 S.W.2d 94, 1951

        ; however, unless the fiscal court formally accepted the road as a “county road,” it did not become a “county road” and, if it was to become formally a “county road,” the minimal width requirement of subsection (2) of this section had to be complied with.

        Any county road established on and after the effective date of the 1914 legislation creating this section is subject to a mandated width of 30 feet right-of-way. The fiscal court can make it more than 30 feet, but 30 feet in width, as to the right-of-way, is mandated.

        Once the fiscal court entered an order accepting and establishing the particular county roads in question as a part of the county road system, such roads became county roads under KRS 178.010(1)(b), even assuming that the minimal width of 30 feet was not observed. It was then up to the fiscal court to acquire the additional right-of-ways which would bring these county roads at least up to the mandated minimal width.

        A road accepted into the county road system must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet, irrespective of whether it had previously existed as a road used by the public for a substantial period.

        Establishment of a public road as a “county road” occurs when a public road is accepted by the fiscal court as part of the county road system, irrespective of when such road was built or originated, thus it follows that a public road “accepted by a fiscal court into the county road system” after the effective date of Acts 1964, ch. 68 § 1 (June 18, 1964), must have a minimum right-of-way width of 30 feet.

        Judgment on the pleadings was properly granted in favor of a county in a city’s action for reimbursement for repairs made to a county road within the city’s annexed territory because once the city annexed the county road, it was the responsibility of the city to maintain that road and the county was relieved of maintenance responsibilities for the road; further, the statutory provisions regarding the discontinuance of a road did not apply because only the legal character of the road had changed.

        In a county that has no road engineer or road supervisor, the attempted closing of a county road with the aid of only a county road foreman would not be substantial compliance with the pertinent statutes.

        Where a dead-end county road was closed by the fiscal court on a landowner’s misrepresentation that he was the sole owner of the adjoining land, another adjoining landowner or the county attorney could not appeal the decision four years later even if the fiscal court did not give proper notice of the intent to close the road.

       <p>
        Where a road was closed without notice to an adjoining landowner because the fiscal court failed to give the proper notice, the county attorney was not required to take any affirmative action because there was no general public interest involved.

        The placing of gates, with locks and keys, on each end of a public lane which connects two county roads cannot be done without formally closing the lane to the public, as prescribed by this chapter, and removing it from the county road system.

        Where the principal use of a road, which was partially washed out when the Kentucky River flooded, was for private access to private property, rather than for a public purpose, the road should be discontinued as a county road. Since such discontinuance will effectively deny one landowner reasonable vehicular ingress and egress from his property to the public highway system, the county would presumably be liable for the depreciation in value of the property of the one landowner so affected.

        Costs of advertising an ordinance for adoption of a road as a county road, and the cost of preparing a deed in connection with conveying a right-of-way to the county, cannot be properly viewed as costs for “construction, reconstruction and maintenance” as used in subsection (2) of KRS

        Where county, in 1892 or prior thereto, closed part of road and abandoned the rest, opening a new road to serve the same public, there was a sufficient closing of the road so that a judgment in a suit between adjoining landowners, permitting one to erect a gate across the road, was valid and binding on their successors in title, although county was not party to suit.

        Where the principal use of a road, which was partially washed out when the Kentucky River flooded, was for private access to private property, rather than for a public purpose, the road should be discontinued as a county road. Since such discontinuance will effectively deny one landowner reasonable vehicular ingress and egress from his property to the public highway system, the county would presumably be liable for the depreciation in value of the property of the one landowner so affected.

       When any person desires the establishment or alteration of a public road, bridge or landing, he shall petition the fiscal court setting forth in his petition specifically the nature and location of the proposed work. The court shall thereupon appoint two (2) viewers who, together with the county road engineer, shall view the ground and report in writing the advantages and disadvantages which, in their opinion, will result to the individual and to the public from the proposed work and the grades and bearings of the proposed road, and other facts and circumstances that may enable the fiscal court to determine whether the work ought to be undertaken by the county.

       If the petition is for the establishment or alteration of a public road leading from a main public road, the report shall set out whether such road should be established, stating specifically whether it would be necessary to take any burying ground, garden, yard, orchard, or any part thereof, or to injure or destroy any buildings and the probable cost of the work, the names of the landowners whose property would have to be taken or injured, which of them would require compensation and the probable amount to which each would be entitled. They shall make careful examination of routes or locations other than that proposed or petitioned for, keeping in view the possible future development of the county and the accommodations of the general traveling public, and shall report to the fiscal court at a public meeting in favor of the one they prefer, giving reasons for the preference. A map giving the grades and bearings of the routes or locations shall be returned with the report.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVc178s178.080ol13">
       If it appears to the fiscal court that the interests of the general public may be furthered thereby, the fiscal court shall personally examine the proposed work. If the court decides to undertake the proposed work the county judge/executive shall appoint a day for hearing the parties interested, and cause notices thereof to be given to all interested parties.

        As to the fiscal court’s determining whether the establishment of a county road or bridge will be in the county’s interest or the general public’s interest, the fiscal court may properly consider: (1) the number of people or families living in the immediate area; (2) the availability of proper funding under KRS Ch. 68; (3) the potential traffic count in the area; (4) the public convenience in terms of social and economic perspective; (5) the potential benefit of the project to the public in general; and (6) the question of whether the project is essentially public in nature; it must be seen that a particular road or bridge could involve the public good or interest, although the enjoyment and advantages derived from their maintenance is not distributed equally, even between members of the public who are situated alike or are in the same class.

        The establishment of a county road to a community of two or more homes is left to the sound judgment of the fiscal court in determining whether the road or bridge will serve the general public interest, and thus justify the expenditure of county tax money; the courts may reverse such decision for road establishment where it appears that the fiscal court acted arbitrarily in considering the general public interest.

        The fiscal court has no authority to construct a bridge or bridges linking a county to a private drive and the same principle applies to the repair of such bridges that are not a part of a “public road,” which public road is a part of the county road system; likewise, the mere beginning of such “private bridges” in no way obligates the fiscal court to finish the projects, since to do so would be strictly illegal.

     <p>
      Where the petition is for the establishment or alteration of a public road leading from the main public road, the court may refuse to undertake the proposed work or abandon it after having undertaken it, unless the petitioner, or someone for him, deposits with the fiscal court a sum sufficient to pay all damage and cost sustained by reason of the establishment or alteration of the road. In such case the court may, if it thinks proper, establish the road upon condition that the petitioner shall pay all costs and damages, and make and keep the road in repair, and the court may also impose upon the petitioner, his heirs and assigns, and upon the public, such other conditions in reference to the road as the court finds just.

        Court of Appeals erred in reversing a circuit court judgment involving whether a road was a private drive or a county road because the owner simply asked the fiscal court to affirm that the road had never officially be taken into the county’s road system, the fiscal court chose not to act upon his request, the county and the fiscal court were the land-owner’s adversaries in the controversy, and there was no reason why the dispute could not be prosecuted as a declaratory judgment proceeding.

        The appropriate standard of review for a Circuit Court to employ when considering the actions of a Fiscal Court regarding the closing of a county road is limited to determining whether the decision not to close the road was arbitrary, including whether there was substantial evidence to support the decision.

        Filling station owner was estopped by his deed to highway department in which it was recited that the conveyance was of a right of way and easement for construction of highway in accordance with plans and specifications on file in the office of the department from claiming damages to his remaining property by reason of the raising of the grade level of the road so as to interfere with the right of ingress and egress to and from his filling station.

        Where stockholders surrendered without consideration part of a turnpike to the fiscal court but refused to surrender another part of the road and county court condemned it and took possession and maintained it as a free county road for over five years, stockholders were estopped by the long acquiescence to deny they had surrendered the road to the county and the transfer was not invalid as against creditors where road was of no value, out of order and subject to forfeiture of franchise by proper proceedings.

      <li id="tXVc178s178.115ol11">
       Whenever the fiscal court of any county deems it to be in the best interest of the county to open, establish or alter the location of any public road, street, alley, ditch, culvert, bridge or similar public way or structure in the county, the fiscal court shall adopt a resolution setting forth the necessity for the public road or structure, and thereupon the public road or structure shall be deemed opened, established or altered, as the case may be, on behalf of the county. A certified copy of the resolution shall be posted at the courthouse door of the county within five (5) days after its adoption and a certified copy of the resolution shall be posted by the county road engineer of the county along or at the proposed road or structure within five (5) days after its adoption.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVc178s178.115ol12">
       In all cases where public roads or structures have been established, any person or persons aggrieved thereby may prosecute an appeal from a resolution of the fiscal court by filing a petition in equity in the Circuit Court of the county where the road or structure is located setting forth his grievance, to which petition shall be attached an attested or certified copy of the resolution. The petition shall be filed within thirty-five (35) days from the date the resolution was entered. An appeal shall be heard and decided by the court without the intervention of a jury. Any party so appealing shall execute and file a bond for costs at the time such appeal is taken. An appeal to the Court of Appeals may be taken in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.

        Under this section, the acceptance of a county road for maintenance is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court and depends upon whether the fiscal court deems such road to be in the best interest of the county. Even if the sections relating to subdivisions have been complied with (see KRS

        The acceptance of a road segment into the county road system rests in the sound discretion of the fiscal court, and it is not necessary that roads be deeded to the county before they are accepted by the county as the fiscal court can enter a resolution under this section establishing a county road prior to any acquisition or conveyance of necessary land.

        Generally, the acceptance of a road for county maintenance, as a part of the county road system, is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court, but the action of a fiscal court, in exercising such discretion, could be reviewed in a Circuit Court action under an alleged arbitrary or capricious exercise of the discretion.

        The fiscal court has the authority to establish an existing road as a county road and whether it does or not is left to the sound discretion of the fiscal court after determining whether such an action is in the county’s best interest, considering such factors as the cost of acquisition and maintenance of the road, the condition of the road at the present time and the impact of such action on the county’s budget.

        As to the fiscal court’s determining whether the establishment of a county road or bridge will be in the county’s interest or the general public’s interest, the fiscal court may properly consider: (1) the number of people or families living in the immediate area; (2) the availability of proper funding under KRS Ch. 68; (3) the potential traffic count in the area; (4) the public convenience in terms of social and economic perspective; (5) the potential benefit of the project to the public in general; and (6) the question of whether the project is essentially public in nature; it must be seen that a particular road or bridge could involve the public good or interest, although the enjoyment and advantages derived from their maintenance is not distributed equally, even between members of the public who are situated alike or are in the same class.

        The establishment of a county road to a community of two (2) or more homes is left to the sound judgment of the fiscal court in determining whether the road or bridge will serve the general public interest, and thus justify the expenditure of a county tax money; the courts may reverse such decision for road establishment where it appears that the fiscal court acted arbitrarily in considering the general public interest.

        The fiscal court has no authority to construct a bridge or bridges linking a county to a private drive and the same principle applies to the repair of such bridges that are not a part of a “public road,” which public road is a part of the county road system; likewise, the mere beginning of such “private bridges” in no way obligates the fiscal court to finish the projects, since to do so would be strictly illegal.

        County road provided “necessary access” to the owners' property within the meaning of this statute because, although the owners had limited permissive use of a passway, this was in stark contrast to their right to reasonable access to the public highway system. While the owners of the property at issue had a temporary means of accessing their property, this limited, permissive easement could not ripen into a permanent, legal right of ingress and egress.

        Unless action is taken under subsection (4) of this section by joint petition wherein the road is closed to the public but remains open to the private parties needing access, the old road bed would revert to the owner or owners of the land out of which the road was built, and a reopening of the road would require the fiscal court to start all over again by condemnation.

        The power of eminent domain is so inherently governmental in character and so essential for the public welfare as not to be susceptible of abridgement by agreement so a contract to substitute overhead crossings for grade crossings cannot prevent a county from opening and maintaining a road across railway tracks at another time or at another place.

       When it is necessary to build or repair a bridge and the building and repair will cost more than five hundred dollars ($500), the county road engineer shall notify the Department of Highways that such work is to be done. The Department of Highways shall then furnish to the county road engineer plans, specifications and estimates of cost, which he shall submit to the fiscal court. The county road engineer shall keep in his records the plans, specifications and estimates of cost furnished by the Department of Highways, and also the plans, specifications and estimates of cost and the actual cost of the repair or construction work which is actually done. The fiscal court shall not be required to accept the plans, specifications and estimates furnished by the Department of Highways.

       When a new hard surface road is to be built, or an old dirt road converted into a hard surface road, the county road engineer of the county in which the improvement is to be made shall notify the Department of Highways, and the department shall send an assistant engineer to assist in laying out the road, and in drawing plans and specifications and making up estimates of cost for the road. This shall be done at the expense of the state. The fiscal court shall not be compelled to accept the plans and specifications of the engineer furnished by the Department of Highways, but a record of them shall be kept. After contracts are awarded, the estimates furnished by the Department of Highways and the contract price shall be published as advertisements provided for in KRS

The order of the fiscal court calling the election shall specify the amount of the tax to be levied each year and the number of years for which the tax may be imposed, not exceeding ten (10) years, and shall also provide that no money in excess of the amount that can be raised by the levy in any one (1) year shall be expended in that year.

        Fiscal court has no discretion, in determining whether funds realized from tax levy may be spent for purpose other than specified statutory purpose, as this section is mandatory insofar as purpose for which money must be used is concerned. Thompson v. Bracken County, 294 S.W.2d 943, 1956
        <cite class="ky_code">

        A distinction in the use of the words “improvement” and “construct” and “repair” and “maintain” has been recognized in statutes concerning highways and roads; improvement and construct mean to make better the original status while maintain and repair mean to preserve or remedy the original condition. Thompson v. Bracken County, 294 S.W.2d 943, 1956

       </p>
       <p>
        Since the purpose of this section is to improve and construct rather than to repair and maintain, the diversion or expenditure of the funds realized from the collection of the special tax levy for repair or maintenance of county roads or bridges was improper and illegal and as such expenditures were not within the purview of the specified purpose of this section they were in violation of Const., § 180 and KRS

        To hold that the words “improve and construct,” when used in this section, include maintenance and repair of roads would be giving these ordinary words a strained and unwarranted meaning, a meaning not contemplated by the legislators. Thompson v. Bracken County, 294 S.W.2d 943, 1956

        Where fiscal court used funds from special tax levy, levied for purpose of improving and constructing county roads and bridges, for the purposes of repairing and maintaining roads and bridges, the funds were being improperly used and court erred in failing to grant a permanent injunction to prevent them from expending such proceeds in such improper manner.

        The fiscal court can, in its sound discretion, and where such construction is needed, build and maintain suitable areas for the safe turning around of school buses, but the county would have to acquire at least an easement right from affected landowners for such areas sufficient to justify the cost to the county.

        Where a school bus must travel two-tenths or three-tenths of a mile from a county road over a private drive to reach an area maintained as a turn around pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the county must acquire the private drive interval by agreement or condemnation, since this section strongly suggests that a turn around is part of the county road system and does not contemplate a private ownership or interval between the county’s road holdings.

        The fiscal court could, with written permission of the city having jurisdiction over a road or street as a city street, construct sidewalks alongside the road or street where needed for school children. Where the public road is not under the jurisdiction of a city or other governmental agency, the fiscal court would have to procure the appropriate easement rights.

        The only exceptions to the basic rule that formal acceptance of a road into the county road system is a prerequisite to a fiscal court’s authority to spend county money on a road or to improve or maintain it, relate to sidewalks and bus turn-arounds for school children, as treated under this section.

        Under this section, a fiscal court may, where needed, build and maintain suitable areas for the safe turning around of school buses. However, the fiscal court would have to acquire at least an easement right from affected landowners for such areas sufficient to justify the cost to the county; neither the school board nor the private owner is responsible for such construction.

      <li id="tXVc178-gradecrossingeliminations178.355ol11">
       Whenever the fiscal court considers it reasonably necessary for the public safety, it may in the manner hereinafter provided, order any railroad company, either steam or electric, owning or operating a railroad in its county, to eliminate any existing grade crossing or change any existing overhead or underpass structure where any county road crosses the railroad tracks of such company.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVc178-gradecrossingeliminations178.355ol12">
       The fiscal court shall give at least ten (10) days’ notice by certified mail, return receipt requested to the railroad company of a hearing to be held at a time and place stated in the notice, at which hearing it shall consider whether or not the proposed grade separation or change is reasonably necessary and the most advantageous method of effecting the grade separation or change. In determining whether the proposed grade separation or change is reasonably necessary, the fiscal court shall receive evidence of, and shall consider, all relevant facts, including the present and prospective density of highway traffic and the present and prospective frequency and speed of train movements over the crossing, the adequacy of existing or proposed signals or warning devices for the protection of highway traffic at the grade crossings, the possibility and probability of personal injury to the public using the highway and to employees and passengers of the railroad company and damage to property, and the cost of the grade separation or change in relation to benefits resulting from the proposed construction. If the fiscal court finds that the grade separation or change is reasonably necessary, it shall make an order to that effect and furnish a copy thereof by certified mail, return receipt requested to the railroad company. The order shall specify a general plan for the new or changed grade separation. The order shall direct the railroad company to prepare plans, specifications and estimates of cost for the grade separation or change in accordance with the general plan prescribed by the order, or may provide that the plans, specifications and estimates of cost shall be prepared by the county if the grade separation structure shall pass over the railroad tracks. The plans, specifications and estimates of cost may, if requested by any public utility, provide facilities for such public utility.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVc178-gradecrossingeliminations178.355ol13">
       Within ninety (90) days after the entry of an order directing a grade separation or change, and the preparation of plans, specifications and estimates of cost by the railroad company, the railroad company shall present to the fiscal court, plans, specifications and estimates of cost for the grade separation or change, including the necessary approaches thereto.
      </li>
      <li id="tXVc178-gradecrossingeliminations178.355ol14">
       After receipt of the plans, specifications and estimates of cost from the railroad company the fiscal court shall give at least ten (10) days’ notice by certified mail, return receipt requested to the railroad company of a time and place for final hearing with respect to the grade separation or change. If the fiscal court elects to prepare plans, specifications and estimates of cost, it shall furnish copies thereof to the railroad company prior to or at the time it gives notice of a final hearing. At the final hearing the fiscal court shall consider whether or not the plans make reasonably adequate provision for present and future safety and convenience of highway traffic and present and future safety and efficiency of operation of trains of the railroad company, its employees and passengers, and for the development of highway and railroad facilities, and shall approve or modify the plans and specifications. It shall then consider and determine the method of doing the work, whether by the railroad company or by the county, or partly by one and partly by the other, and whether by contract or by the employees of the county or the railroad company, or both, or by any combination of these methods, and if by contract, the method and manner of advertising for bids, the time and place of opening the bids, the time when work shall be begun and completed, and all similar matters of an administrative nature. The fiscal court shall embody its conclusions in a final order, a copy of which shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested to the railroad company.

The fiscal court may reject all bids and elect to do the work itself, or partly by itself and by the railroad company, or by contractors, or by a combination of these methods. If the work includes a structure to support the railroad tracks, the railroad company shall have the right to supervise the construction of that part of the work. If the fiscal court elects to do the work itself there shall not be charged to the railroad company any sum in excess of that it would have been required to pay had the contract been let to the lowest bidder.

       As the work progresses the fiscal court shall furnish to the railroad company, and the railroad company shall furnish to the fiscal court, a monthly statement showing in detail all amounts expended in connection with the work. On or about the fifteenth of each month, the county road engineer shall prepare a statement showing the total amount expended to the close of the preceding month, the amount paid or expended by each party up to that time, and the amount due from the county to the railroad company or from the railroad company to the county. Upon receipt of the statement each party shall pay to the other the amounts shown to be due thereby.

Each party shall be afforded reasonable opportunities to verify the statements of expenditures by the other, and the balance due as certified by the county road engineer in his final statement shall be paid by one party to the other promptly upon receipt of such final statement.

     <p>
      While the grand jury and courts cannot disturb the fiscal court when it is properly performing its ministerial duties in keeping the courthouse and county roads in proper repair, the members of the fiscal court would be subject to indictment and prosecution where charges are properly drawn alleging misfeasance or malfeasance in office, or wilful neglect in discharge of official duties.

        Court of Appeals erred in granting a new trial because ample evidence on the issue of the county engineer's duty—to remove a tree that had fallen on a road or to warn motorists of the hazard—was presented and supported the jury verdict where the trial court's jury instructions did not misstate the engineer's duties, the duty was ministerial, after the jury heard extensive testimony that the director of public works had assigned the duty of tree removal to the assistant director in charge of operations and maintenance, and being instructed on the specific duties required of the county engineer, the jury unanimously found that he had not breached his duty, and the statute was directory and substantial compliance could satisfy its provisions.

    Municipal employees were not entitled to summary judgment on the ground of qualified official immunity when it was alleged that the employees were negligent in failing to maintain the trees and signage in a safe and reasonable manner at an intersection where a motor vehicle accident occurred because genuine issues of material fact existed due to the conflicting evidence regarding the personal responsibility of each of the employees as a “county engineer” for the removal of hazardous vegetation burdening the local highways.

        Court of Appeals erred in granting a new trial because ample evidence on the issue of the county engineer's duty—to remove a tree that had fallen on a road or to warn motorists of the hazard—was presented and supported the jury verdict where the trial court's jury instructions did not misstate the engineer's duties, the duty was ministerial, after the jury heard extensive testimony that the director of public works had assigned the duty of tree removal to the assistant director in charge of operations and maintenance, and being instructed on the specific duties required of the county engineer, the jury unanimously found that he had not breached his duty, and the statute was directory and substantial compliance could satisfy its provisions.

        Since the overall supervision of the county road program is the responsibility of the county judge/executive, the road supervisor or engineer is required to carry out his technical road duties, but under the supervision of the county judge/executive; this means that when the fiscal court wants an engineer report on the program, the fiscal court should request the county judge/executive to have himself and the road supervisor present at the fiscal court meeting or meetings for purposes of the report and any discussion which may ensue.

        Where KRS 178.025(2), governing highway rights-of-way, was not enacted until 44 years after the electric lines were constructed, and the legislature did not expressly direct that the statute should be retroactively applied, the court could not apply KRS 178.025(2), in order to determine whether the electric lines were in right-of-way, without violating KRS 446.080(3), which prohibits the retroactive application of statutes.

        Liability under this section depends upon whether the utility facility is constructed on public right-of-way and, thus, for the bureau of highways to prevail, it must establish that a particular utility facility is constructed on right-of-way, while the utility would have to prove that it was not; therefore, the affirmative of the issue, i.e., whether a particular utility facility was originally constructed on public right-of-way, is on the bureau (now department) and, if no evidence as to this issue is adduced by either side, the bureau’s (now department’s) claim under the statute would be defeated.

        Where there was no evidence to support a finding that there was any public occupancy of the disputed area prior to construction of electric lines, nor any evidence that it had ever been publicly maintained, the bureau (now department) of highways did not acquire prescriptive rights superior to utility’s so as to require utility to pay the costs of moving the electric lines to improve road.

        The trial court’s findings that public right-of-way had always been considered to extend to the fences along roads, that KRS 178.025(2) had merely codified that rule, and thus, that electric lines constructed prior to enactment of statute were originally constructed on public right-of-way, were clearly erroneous since no authorities recognize the presumption set forth in KRS 178.025(2) as a substantive rule, and since former statute in effect at time of construction of the electric lines did not either expressly or by implication create a presumption that all property between a road and the fence lines adjoining it was part of the public right-of-way.

     Engineer may enter private lands to prevent flooding of roads.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The county road engineer may enter upon any of the lands adjacent to any public road for the purpose of opening any existing ditch or drain, or for digging a new ditch or drain for the free passage of water for the drainage of public roads. He may enter upon land adjoining streams to drive piles, throw up embankments, or to perform any other work necessary to keep the streams within their proper channels, and to prevent their encroachment upon public roads or abutments of bridges. He may also enter upon the lands adjoining a public road, which during the time of high water is subject to overflow from streams to remove or change the position of a fence or other obstructions, preventing the free flow of water under or through a bridge or culvert whenever it is necessary for the protection of a public road or bridge.

      The department may contract in advance of the issuance of the bonds that while bonds of the project are outstanding, it will keep the bridges in the project adequately insured for the protection of the state and the bondholders, in companies satisfactory to the bondholders, under an “all-risk coverage” policy either for the full insurable value or for the face value of the bonds outstanding for such project, whichever is the lesser amount. The department may also contract to carry, during the same period, insurance policies in companies satisfactory to the bondholders, covering the use and occupancy of the bridges in such project, in an amount sufficient to provide an income for one (1) year equal to at least one (1) year’s interest upon the bonds then outstanding. The premium upon the policies shall be paid from appropriations out of the state road fund unless other provision for payment, but not out of bridge tolls and revenues, is made by law. The department may carry insurance of a lesser extent or amount if adequate in the judgment of the department and the original purchasers of the bonds.

      Prior to the opening for public use of any interstate bridge, the construction of which is authorized by any law of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, regardless of the state agency, commission or administrative body so authorized to make such construction, the state agency, commission or administrative body so authorized to construct, operate and maintain any such interstate bridge shall purchase the ferry, equipment, franchises, rights and privileges used in connection with the operation of any ferry which has been in continuous operation for at least fifteen (15) years prior thereto and which is located within five (5) miles of the site of said bridge, and pay the owner therefor a fair cash value; provided, that in the event such agency, commission or administrative body and the owner of such ferry shall be unable to agree upon a fair cash value, the valuation of such property shall be determined by three (3) persons; one (1) to be selected by the agency authorized to make such construction, one (1) to be selected by the owners of the ferry and the third to be selected by these two (2). The ferry shall be valued as a going concern, but no allowance shall be made for future growth. In the event the owner of such ferry shall not agree to the establishment of such valuation according to the foregoing method, then in such event, the agency, commission or administrative body shall not be required to purchase such assets from the owner of the ferry.

        The terms of this compensation statute apply to the operation of “any ferry,” not to any particular type of ferry; accordingly, the owner of a ferry designed for pedestrian travel, rather than vehicular travel, was entitled to compensation under this section when a nearby interstate bridge was opened, even though the bridge provided for vehicular traffic to the specific exclusion of pedestrian travel.

        The Commonwealth was equitably estopped from claiming that a former ferry operator was not entitled to compensation under the terms of this section on the ground that he stopped operating his ferry business and sold his boats over a year before the interstate bridge was opened, where the evidence showed that prior to selling his boats the ferry operator repeatedly requested that the Commonwealth negotiate with him pursuant to the terms of this section, but that the Commonwealth refused the requests to negotiate based on its opinion that this section was unconstitutional.

        Inasmuch as the alleged economic loss occasioned by the building of an interstate bridge is not a “taking” or is not a trespass as to be equivalent to a “taking,” the purchase of a ferry for the sole purpose of protecting the owner from financial loss would not be a proper implementation of the eminent domain concept.

The authority shall adopt rules and regulations for the transaction of its business; and the secretary shall keep a record of all its business, and shall furnish a copy thereof to each member of the authority. It shall be the duty of the authority, in general, to promote, encourage, and coordinate the efforts of the party states to secure the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. Toward this end, the authority shall have power to hold hearings; to conduct studies and surveys of all problems, benefits, and other matters associated with the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, and to make reports thereon; to acquire, by gift or otherwise, and hold and dispose of such money and property as may be provided for the proper performance of their function; to cooperate with other public or private groups, whether local, state, regional, or national, having an interest in waterways development; to formulate and execute plans and policies for emphasizing the purpose of this compact before the Congress of the United States and other appropriate officers and agencies of the United States; and to exercise such other powers as may be appropriate to enable it to accomplish its functions and duties in connection with the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway and to carry out the purposes of this compact.

By providing essential transportation infrastructure to the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the airport board and the airport corporation were exercising a function integral to state government under KRS 183.133(6); as such, the organizations and their members could not be held liable in tort.

Implicit within that operational power is the authority to provide emergency crashfire rescue service to aircraft utilizing the airport runways. The aircraft of the UPS air parcel delivery operation is integrated with the operation of the airfield, since UPS aircraft land and take off on the regular runways at Standiford Field, although their aircraft are parked and normally fueled on the UPS ramps. Therefore, the Authority may enter into an agreement with the city of Louisville by which the authority undertakes to render such emergency service to UPS aircraft which may be in trouble either on the airfield runways or when they reach the UPS parking ramps.

       Financing plan, whereby banks agreed to advance money to pay condemnation award on acquisition of additional land to extend air field and to obtain lien therefor on land, but without obligation by air board to repay the money or by city to levy tax for board’s benefit, did not constitute borrowing of money by board and obligation to repay it out of revenues for ensuing year in violation of Const., § 157.

        Under this section a city is relieved of tort liability for damages that might arise over an accident at a municipally operated airport.

        An urban-county airport board is a public or municipal corporation and an instrumentality of the Commonwealth and as a municipal corporation it possesses only such power as the Constitution and the general assembly have expressly or impliedly granted.

        The Airport Authority, as the air board, has the authority to establish and fix reasonable charges or fees, to be applied to UPS, for the rendition of emergency service involving UPS aircraft rendered either on the airfield or UPS ramps, either for an annual fee, or on a per occasion basis.

       <p>
        Under the explicit language of this section, the air board, i.e., the Regional Airport Authority, has the power, inter alia, to establish an airport and to maintain, equip and operate such airport. Implicit within that operational power is the authority to provide emergency crashfire rescue service to aircraft utilizing the airport runways. The aircraft of the UPS air parcel delivery operation is integrated with the operation of the airfield, since UPS aircraft land and take off on the regular runways at Standiford Field, although their aircraft are parked and normally fueled on the UPS ramps. Therefore, the Authority may enter into an agreement with the city of Louisville by which the Authority undertakes to render such emergency service to UPS aircraft which may be in trouble either on the airfield runways or when they reach the UPS parking ramps.

      It is hereby found and declared that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in the vicinity, and in effect reduces the size of the area available for landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment therein, and therefore such hazards are not in the interest of the public health, public safety or general welfare. It is further found that any obstructions to the use of navigable air space destroy and impair the safe use of such air space thereby endangering aircraft and are not in the interest of public health, public safety or general welfare.

      In addition to considering the regulations or standards promulgated by the Federal Aviation Administration in zoning the use of land and structures in areas over which jurisdiction is assumed, the commission shall consider among other things the safety of airport users and surface persons and property, the character of flying operations conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain, the height of existing structures and trees above the level of the airport, the views of officials of the Federal Aviation Administration as to the safe approaches required for operations at the airport, the future development of the airport including extensions to runways that may be required, the density of dwellings that may safely be permitted in the area, protection of the public investment in the airport and its facilities, the interest of the public in developing a sound public air transportation system within the state and the views and opinions of those owning land in such area.

      The Airport Authority, as the air board, has the authority to establish and fix reasonable charges or fees, to be applied to UPS, for the rendition of emergency service involving UPS aircraft rendered either on the airfield or UPS ramps, either for an annual fee, or on a per occasion basis.

      , the air board, i.e., the Regional Airport Authority, has the power, inter alia, to establish an airport and to maintain, equip and operate such airport. Implicit within that operational power is the authority to provide emergency crashfire rescue service to aircraft utilizing the airport runways. The aircraft of the UPS air parcel delivery operation is integrated with the operation of the airfield, since UPS aircraft land and take off on the regular runways at Standiford Field, although their aircraft are parked and normally fueled on the UPS ramps. Therefore, the Authority may enter into an agreement with the city of Louisville by which the Authority undertakes to render such emergency service to UPS aircraft which may be in trouble either on the airfield runways or when they reach the UPS parking ramps.

        providing for establishment of public road districts affecting only counties containing cities of the first class was not local legislation violative of Const., § 59, where classification rested upon a distinctive and natural reason rather than an arbitrary one. Allison v. Borders, 299

        When a law applicable to less than all the counties of the state is valid as a proper and reasonable classification, it is a general law since it applies to all the counties within the classification and the uniformity provided for in Const., § 141 (now repealed) is not destroyed merely because some of the administrative or other duties are to be performed by the county judge (now county judge/executive).

        Since a public road district can only be established by a person or a group of persons owning property abutting upon a public road (which is neither a county road nor a state road) public road districts within a county may not be combined into one big road district involving all of the unincorporated portion of the county.

       In the event that the board of directors determines to issue road improvement bonds, or road district bonds for maintenance purposes, it may pledge the special assessment and liens on the property for the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds and shall apply the proceeds exclusively to the payment of the bonds. The bonds shall bear a date not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days after the date which was the last day for the execution by the property owners of installment payment agreements. The bonds shall be negotiable and payable to bearer, shall provide for the semiannual or more frequent payment of interest, shall bear coupons to provide for the payment of the interest, shall be numbered consecutively, shall be in denominations of one hundred dollars ($100) or its multiple (provided that any odd amount not in multiple of one hundred dollars ($100) may be included in the last bond to mature), shall be divided into nine (9) series as nearly equal as practicable, one (1) series maturing each year, and shall be payable at the office of the treasurer of the road district or at a bank or trust company named in the bonds. The bonds shall have the name of the road for the improvement or maintenance of which they are issued printed or engraved on the bonds, shall state the character and extent of the improvements, or the character and extent of the contemplated maintenance, shall be signed by the chairman and secretary of the board of directors, and the coupons shall be signed by the secretary either personally or by his engraved or lithographed facsimile signature.

       It shall not be necessary in the bonds to recite the steps taken for the improvement of the road, maintenance of the road, or in making the assessment of the cost, but it shall be sufficient to make a general reference to the proceedings and to this chapter. The bonds shall be exempt from all taxation by or in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The bonds shall convey and transfer to the owner of the bonds all lien, right, title, and interest in and to the assessments and liens upon the respective parcels of land abutting upon the improvement. The liens, until released after payment, shall be security for the bonds and coupons until they are paid.

      <li id="tXVc184s184.260ol13">
       The bonds shall be subject to prepayment and redemption at any interest period which does not occur within four (4) years from the date of the issue of the bonds. The treasurer of the district shall, when funds have accumulated from any special assessment sufficient to redeem in excess of the next series falling due, by lot select from the next succeeding issue falling due, bonds of a par value equal to the excess in the fund arising from the excess collection and shall advertise by publication pursuant to KRS Chapter 424 the designation and numbers of the bond or bonds so drawn to the effect that on the specified date, the bonds will be redeemed at their par value and accrued interest. The bonds specified in the notice shall bear no interest after the date fixed for their redemption, which provision shall be set forth in substance on the bonds.

The contractor shall accept the bonds and give credit on the contract price for the full face value and accrued interest on the bonds. Any premium realized from the sale of the bonds and any penalties collected on account of the delinquency of any installment payments of assessments shall be added to the bond fund for the payment of the bonds and interest on the bonds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In any action to foreclose its lien brought by the road district or by any bondholder, it shall not be necessary to make the other bondholders parties. The proceeds of the suit shall be paid to the treasurer of the district and by him applied to the redemption of matured bonds as if the payment had been made without suit. In such a suit, an allegation in substance that the improvement of the road had been duly made and completed and such assessment levied therefor and bonds for unpaid portion of the cost had been issued pursuant to resolutions and proceedings duly adopted and had by the board of directors in accordance with law, shall be a sufficient pleading of such resolutions and proceedings without setting the same out in full or making further reference thereto. The road district is hereby authorized to bid an amount not in excess of its lien and costs for any property sold in such suit.
