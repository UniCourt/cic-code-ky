       When the court refers to it any proceeding to establish or construct any improvement, the board shall employ a competent drainage engineer, who shall be the chief engineer for the work. The board may prescribe the number of assistant engineers to be selected by the chief engineer. The chief engineer shall have control of the work until completed, or until his removal by the board, and may assign portions to each assistant. He may, with the consent of the board, consult any eminent engineer and obtain his opinion or advice concerning the drainage of the district. He may employ such assistants as are necessary to make a complete topographical survey of the district, and shall enter upon the ground and make a survey of the main drains and all the laterals.

The course and distance of each ditch, and width of right-of-way, shall be carefully noted and sufficient notes made so that it may be accurately plotted and mapped. A line of levels shall be run for the entire work and sufficient data secured from which accurate profiles and plans may be made. Frequent bench marks shall be established along the line, on permanent objects, and their elevation recorded in the field books. Other levels may be run to determine the fall from one part of the district to another. If an old watercourse, ditch or channel is being altered it shall be accurately cross sectioned, so as to compute the amount of cubic yards saved by the use of the old channel. If a private ditch is utilized, the saving by reason of its use shall be carefully computed and reported, with the name of the owner. A drainage map of the district shall then be completed, showing the location of every improvement and the boundary, as closely as may be reasonably determined, of the lands owned by each individual landowner within the district. The location of any railroad or public highway and the boundary of any incorporated city within the district shall be shown on the map. There shall be prepared to accompany the map a profile showing the surface of the ground, and the bottom or grade of the proposed improvement.

All such maps, profiles, plans and specifications, together with the report of the engineer and all exhibits filed therewith, shall be made in duplicate, one to be marked original and the other duplicate. If lands in counties other than the one in which the proceeding is pending are affected, an additional copy of the maps and profiles shall be made and filed with the county clerk of the other counties. The original shall not be withdrawn from the custody of the clerk, but the duplicate may be withdrawn for use by the viewers, the board, or for use on the work by the engineer or contractor.

       The viewers shall meet on the day named in the notice provided by KRS 267.150, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and proceed with their work, for which the clerk shall furnish them with the duplicate plan of drainage adopted by the board. As soon after their first meeting as possible, the viewers shall examine the land in the district; the railroad property in the district; all other improvements, highways and bridges that may be affected by the proposed improvement; and all ditches, drains, ponds, lakes, creeks and watercourses in the district, or that are partly within and partly without the district. A majority of the viewers shall control and decide all questions.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXIIc267s267.160ol12">
       The viewers shall classify the land in the district with reference to the benefit it will receive from the improvement. In the case of drainage, the degree of wetness of the land, its proximity to the ditch or a natural outlet and the fertility of the soil shall be considered in determining the amount of benefit it will receive by the construction of the ditch. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the land benefited shall be separated into five classes. The land receiving the highest benefit shall be marked “Class A”; that receiving the next highest, “Class B”; that receiving the next highest, “Class C”; that receiving the next highest, “Class D”; and that receiving the smallest benefit, “Class E.” The holding of any one landowner need not be all in one class, but the number of acres in each class shall be ascertained, though its boundary need not be separately marked on the ground nor shown on the map. The total number of acres owned by one (1) person in each class and the total number of acres benefited shall be determined. The total number of acres of each class in the entire district shall be determined and presented in tabulated form. The scale of assessment to be made by the board upon the several classes of land returned by the viewers shall be in the ratio of five (5), four (4), three (3), two (2) and one (1). Whenever five (5) mills per acre are assessed against the land in “Class A,” four (4) mills per acre shall be assessed against the land in “Class B,” three (3) mills per acre in “Class C,” two (2) mills per acre in “Class D,” and one (1) mill per acre in “Class E.” This shall form the basis of the assessment of benefits to the land for drainage purposes, and in calculating the assessment against each landowner the board shall follow the classification.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXIIc267s267.160ol13">
       If the viewers believe that existing conditions would cause substantial injustice to any landowner by strict conformity to the five-class rule, the classification may be changed by diminishing or increasing the number of classes to conform to such conditions, or the viewers may report the benefits they estimate will accrue to each tract of land without dividing the land into classes. If the classification is changed the viewers shall indicate to the board the ratio of assessment for such changed classification as compared with the five-class rule.

If the work is delayed by any good cause and the report is not completed at the time fixed by the court, the viewers shall appear before the court and state in writing the cause of such failure and ask for sufficient time to complete the work, whereupon the court shall set another date by which the report shall be completed and filed. The viewers shall not modify the adopted plan for drainage. The report shall contain a statement of the estimated cost of the works and improvements to be made in the district, a description of all the land in said district and the names of the owners thereof, and a general description of all the railroad rights-of-way, roadbeds and depot grounds, and the name of the corporation to which they belong at the date of the decree of the court organizing the district. The report shall also contain a statement of the estimated benefits per acre that will accrue to each class of land by reason of the proposed improvement, and each tract of land shall be assessed according to benefits as shown by the report.

       Upon final reference to it by the court of any drainage proceedings, the board shall give notice by publication pursuant to KRS Chapter 424 in the county in which the improvement is located, of the time and place of letting the work of construction and of the approximate amount of work to be done and the time fixed for its completion. On the date appointed for the letting the board, together with the chief engineer, shall convene and let the work to the lowest responsible bidder, either as a whole or in sections, as they may deem most advantageous for the district. No bid shall be entertained that exceeds the estimated cost unless for good reasons it is shown that the original estimate was erroneous. The board may reject all bids and advertise again, if it believes it will be in the interest of the district to do so. The board may employ persons and teams and lease, rent, hire or purchase machinery and equipment, and directly construct the improvement according to the plans and specifications, without letting a contract. The board may exercise the same power in cleaning out, straightening and reconstructing old public ditches, but the expense in any case shall not exceed the estimate of the drainage engineer for the work.

The board may maintain action for breach of the contract against any contractor and the sureties on his bond, and in case of breach of the contract the work may be advertised and relet in the same manner as the original letting.

        Provision of subsection (1) of this section that the notice shall fix time for completion of the work is not mandatory in the sense that a contract fairly entered into is vitiated because a specified time for construction is not fixed in the advertisement, for if the time is not so fixed the parties must be regarded as having agreed that the work will be completed within a reasonable time. Porter v. Moore, 200 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 95</cite>, 252 S.W. 97, 1923 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 3</cite> (Ky. 1923).

       <p>
        The estimate of cost is erroneous if the work cannot be done for that figure, whether this condition be due to a mistake of the viewers when the estimate was made or to an unexpected increase in cost of materials and labor. Board of Drainage Comm'rs v. Reichert, 189 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 81</cite>, 224 S.W. 470, 1920 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 378</cite> (Ky. 1920).

        The assessing of lands for the cost of drains, where their construction will result in public benefit, promote the public health, and be conducive to the general welfare, is a proper and lawful exercise of the inherent taxing power of the state. Williams v. Wedding, 165 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 361</cite>, 176 S.W. 1176, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 531</cite> (Ky. 1915).

       <p>
        The assessment of special taxes upon lands, such as are assessed for the construction and maintenance of public drainage ditches, can only be justified upon the grounds that they are imposed to pay for local improvements which confer special benefits upon the lands assessed, and only to the extent of such benefits.

     <p>
      If the total assessment against the land is less than an average of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per acre, the assessments shall be collected in one installment. In that case, after the assessment roll has been made out and one (1) copy delivered to the county treasurer, as provided in <cite class="ocky"><a href="#tXXIIc267s267.300" target="_self">KRS 267.300</a></cite>, notice thereof shall be given by publication pursuant to KRS <cite class="ocky"><a href="gov.ky.krs.title.38.html#tXXXVIIIc424" target="_blank">Chapter 424</a></cite>, and by posting one (1) notice at the courthouse door in each county in which land assessed is located. At any time within thirty (30) days thereafter, any landowner may pay the assessment against his land to the treasurer, who shall enter proper credit on the assessment roll. After said thirty (30) days the board shall recover the assessment roll from the treasurer and deliver it to the sheriff, accompanied by an order to collect the unpaid assessments. The sheriff shall proceed to collect the assessments. If land in any other county is assessed, a copy of the assessment roll, insofar as it relates to that land, shall be certified to the sheriff of that county. The roll, when placed in the hands of the sheriff, shall have the same effect as a tax against the land assessed, and shall be collected in the same manner as state and county taxes, except that the sheriff shall add to each assessment shown the amount of his commission. If not paid by December 1 following the date of certification or order to collect, a penalty of six percent (6%) shall be added.

       At the expiration of thirty (30) days after publication of the notice required by KRS 267.320, the board may divide the unpaid assessments into annual installments, not less than two (2) nor more than thirty (30), which shall draw interest at the rate or rates or method of determining rates, payable at least annually, from thirty (30) days after the date of publication, and may issue bonds to anticipate their collection, which bonds shall mature in series to correspond with the installments into which the unpaid assessments are divided. The bonds shall draw interest at the rate or rates or method of determining rates, payable at least annually, as the board determines and be payable at some place designated by the board. The bonds shall be for the exclusive use and benefit of the district, and shall designate on their face the name of the district and the purpose for which they were issued. The board, in dividing the unpaid assessments into installments, shall fix the time for payment in each year so that each installment will be due at least one hundred and twenty days (120) before the bonds issued to anticipate the collection of that installment become due. Each landowner whose land is in lien for the payment of the bonds shall pay to the treasurer each installment due against his land, with all interest due at that time on that installment and deferred installments, on or before the time fixed by the board for the maturity of the installment.

       On the first Monday after any installment is due, the board shall meet and ascertain the persons whose installments are in default, and shall, on that date, issue warrants to the sheriff directing him to collect those installments. The sheriff shall collect each installment with interest due on that and deferred installments, together with a penalty of six percent (6%), as state and county taxes are collected, and settle with the board within sixty (60) days from the date the installments were certified to him, and pay to the board the money collected.

       All land upon which the money due on any installment has not been collected at the end of the said sixty (60) days shall be advertised and sold by the sheriff in the same manner as is provided in the case of state and county taxes. The sale shall be subject to the future installments of the assessments. At the expiration of ninety (90) days from the date of the original certification of the installment to the sheriff, he shall make final settlement with the board and pay to it all money in his hands. If he fails to do this the board may compel him to make settlement by rule against him issued by the court in which the proceeding is pending, after giving him five (5) days’ notice in writing. If any land is not purchased at the sale, the sheriff shall purchase it for the district, and in his final settlement with the board shall take a credit. The sheriff shall certify each sale to the county clerk, as required in the sale of land for state and county taxes, and the clerk shall record the sale in the land sale book kept by him. For collecting the assessments certified to him the sheriff shall be paid by the board the same fees allowed him for collecting state and county taxes and in the same manner. For recording the certificate of sale the clerk shall be paid the same fees allowed him by law for similar work in reference to state and county taxes. The owner of the land, or his representatives, heirs or assigns, may redeem the land from the sale in the manner and within the time provided for the redemption of land sold for state and county taxes. Any sheriff who fails to settle and pay off any installment with interest within the proper time shall be liable to the board for the full amount certified to him, with interest. This may be collected from the sheriff by rule issued against him by the court in which the proceeding is pending on five (5) days’ written notice.

        Where land subject to drainage assessments has been sold at judicial sale in a proceeding to enforce collection of delinquent assessments, the purchaser at the sale takes the land free from any lien as to past due assessments, and the land cannot be reassessed to supply any deficiency in the collection of the delinquent assessments resulting from the failure of the sale to bring a sufficient amount to pay the delinquent assessments in full.

      Any person who acquires title to any land affected by any proceeding under this chapter after the preliminary report of the viewers is filed shall be deemed privy to the person owning or in possession under claim of ownership at the time the preliminary report is filed, and shall be bound to the same extent as the owner at that time would be bound if he had remained the owner. The land assessed shall be liable for the assessment against it, and each assessment or installment shall be paid by the owner in possession at the time it becomes due, but as between vendor and purchaser, and in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the owner in possession at the time any assessment is certified by the board for collection shall be liable for the tax. Any land in which one person owns the life estate, with the remainder to another, shall be assessed and classified by the viewers as any other land, and the names of both life tenant and remainderman reported, if known, and both brought before the court. The tax shall be assessed against each such tract of land, and may be paid by either the life tenant or the remainderman. When so paid the one not paying shall be liable to the one who has paid for such proportion of the amount paid as his interest in the property bears to the total property assessed, according to the life tables at the time in use in this state. To secure contribution the person paying the assessment shall have, for his own benefit, the same lien that is provided for the original tax, which may be enforced by action in any court of competent jurisdiction. In like manner an owner of an undivided interest in land assessed may pay the whole assessment and be entitled to like contribution and substitution.

In all suits for the collection of delinquent assessments the judgment shall include all costs of suit and a reasonable attorney’s fee to be taxed by the court.

        The assessment of special taxes upon lands, such as are assessed for the construction and maintenance of public drainage ditches, can only be justified upon the grounds that they are imposed to pay for local improvements which confer special benefits upon the lands assessed, and only to the extent of such benefits. Williams v. Wedding, 165 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 361</cite>, 176 S.W. 1176, 1915 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 531</cite> (Ky. 1915); Book v.

        The board was authorized to levy maintenance assessments to deepen or enlarge a ditch to the specifications provided for its original construction, where contractor had failed to cut ditch to full depth specified. Book v. Trigg, 186 <cite class="ky_code"> Ky. 664</cite>, 217 S.W. 1013, 1920 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 21</cite> (Ky. 1920).

      The owner of any land that has been assessed for the cost of any improvement may use the improvement as an outlet for lateral drains from his land. If the land is separated from the improvement by the land of another, and the owners are unable to agree as to the terms on which the one may enter the land of the other and construct the drain or ditch, he may file his ancillary petition in the pending proceeding, and have the same condemned in the same manner as provided in the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky.

Thereafter similar elections shall be held biennially and for four (4) year terms. The supervisors within two (2) weeks following their election shall elect from their number a chairman and vice chairman. A secretary-treasurer shall be elected who may or may not be of their number. At this meeting the supervisors shall fix the number, time and place of regular meetings. Special meetings of supervisors may be on call of the chairman. The board of supervisors shall have the authority to fix salaries as provided above, to determine qualification standards for a drainage commissioner, secure and appoint such commissioner, to counsel and advise with the commissioner for the purpose of effecting the greatest good to the greatest number of land owners within the district, and shall receive and record reports of progress from the commissioner.

       As soon as practicable after the judgment establishing a separate drainage district becomes final, the county judge/executive shall, with the advice and assistance of the engineer, enter an order dividing the district into three (3) precincts, as near equal in area of lands reported as benefited as is practicable, and calling a meeting of the landowners affected, to be had at some public place in the county in which the proceeding is pending, at a day and hour fixed in the order. The date for the meeting shall be not less than twenty (20) days from the entry of the order calling it. The county clerk shall give notice of the meeting by publication pursuant to KRS Chapter 424, and by posting not less than five (5) posters in different public places in the district at least fifteen (15) days before the date set. The landowners, when assembled, shall organize by the election of a chairman and secretary of the meeting, who shall conduct the election. At this election each acre of land, as near as may be arrived at by estimate or from the evidence heard before the county judge/executive on the cross-petition, shall represent one (1) share, and each owner shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share estimated to be owned by him in the district. The name of at least one (1) person shall be put in nomination for the office of district commissioner from each of the three (3) precincts. The one (1) person from each of the three (3) precincts receiving the highest number of votes shall be declared elected as district commissioner.

     Enlargement of district.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any drainage district organized under the provisions of this chapter may be enlarged and the boundaries extended so as to include other contiguous land, in the manner set forth in this section. The board may present a petition to the county judge/executive who organized the district, asking that the boundaries of the district be extended and such outlying land be included in the district, particularly describing the land and giving the name of the owner. When such petition is filed, the owner of any land to be included in the district shall be brought before the county judge/executive in the same manner as an original party to the proceeding, with the same right to protest against the proposed action or file exceptions thereto. If no objection is made to the petition, the county judge/executive shall order the land included and the boundaries enlarged or extended as prayed. If any objection is made, the county judge/executive shall hear the objection and shall order all or any part of the land included as appears just, and the boundaries shall be ordered changed accordingly. The land so included shall be subject to all dues, assessments and liabilities and entitled to all the benefits and privileges of the district the same as the land originally incorporated. The owner of any land contiguous to any such district may by petition to the county judge/executive and with the consent of the board have his land annexed to the district on such terms as the county judge/executive may deem just, and thereafter his land shall be part of the district the same as the other land in the district.

        The period of organization and of assessment of benefits and damages, is completed when judgment organizing the district is entered upon report of appraisers. Handley v. Graham, 187 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 316</cite>, 219 S.W. 417, 1920 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 121</cite> (Ky. 1920).

       <p>
        Up to the stage of the proceeding to establish a drainage district covered by this section any landowner could rely upon any objections or exceptions filed by any other landowner, but at this juncture the judgment of the court fixing the amount of benefits or damages to each tract of land becomes a several and not a joint judgment, applicable to each separate tract of land. Byron v. Mayfield Creek Drainage Dist., 206 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 309</cite>, 267 S.W. 191, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 347</cite> (Ky. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment organizing a drainage district further necessarily concludes the question of liability for assessments for the future maintenance and upkeep of the district, except insofar as the landowner may from time to time except to such assessments as provided by statute. Holt v. Madison Coal Corp., 250 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 76</cite>, 61 S.W.2d 1064, 1933 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 640</cite> (Ky. 1933).

       </p>
       <p>
        While the appraisers’ report is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein, when exceptions are filed to the report the case is to be determined by the court on all the evidence. Board of Drainage Comm'rs v. Chicago, S. L. &amp; N. O. R. Co., 206 <cite class="ocky"> Ky. 306</cite>, 267 S.W. 205, 1924 <cite class="ky_app_code">Ky. LEXIS 353</cite> (Ky. 1924).

        Where landowner did not appeal judgment entered in drainage district proceeding with all parties before the court, successor in title cannot obtain relief from that judgment by an independent action in circuit court of another county.

       The board of drainage commissioners may, if in their judgment it seems best, issue bonds on behalf of any district under their control, not to exceed ninety percent (90%) of the total amount of the minimum district assessments levied upon the property of the district approved by the county judge/executive. The bonds shall be in denominations of not less than one hundred dollars ($100), bearing interest payable at least annually from the date of issue, to mature at annual or more frequent intervals within thirty (30) years, commencing after a period of years not later than five (5) years, to be determined by the board. Both principal and interest shall be payable at some convenient bank or trust company’s office, to be named in the bonds. The bonds shall be signed by the president of the board, attested with the seal of the board, and the signature of the secretary and countersigned by the county clerk of the county in which the district is organized. All bonds shall be executed and delivered to the treasurer of the district, who shall sell them in quantities and at dates as the board considers necessary. The funds derived from the sale of bonds shall be used only to pay the cost of improvements and the expenses, fees, and salaries authorized by law. The secretary of the board shall certify to the county clerk in which the district was organized a copy of the resolution authorizing and directing the issuance of the bonds, which shall contain a list of the bonds, their dates of maturity, and amounts. The clerk shall record this resolution in the lis pendens record in his office. The bonds shall show on their face the purpose for which they are issued.
      </li>

       The bonds shall be payable out of money derived from the assessments upon property, and a sufficient amount of the drainage assessment shall be appropriated by the board to pay the principal and interest. This sum shall be preserved in a separate fund for that purpose. All bonds and coupons not paid at maturity shall bear interest from maturity until paid, or until sufficient funds for their payment have been deposited at the place of payment, and this interest shall be appropriated by the board out of the penalties and interest collected on assessments or any other available funds of the district. The board, in making the annual levy of assessments, shall take into account the maturing bonds and interest on all bonds and make ample provisions in advance for their payment. If the proceeds of the original levy of assessments are not sufficient to pay the principal and interest of all bonds issued, the board shall make any additional levy upon benefits assessed necessary for this purpose. However, no levy of assessments shall be made in excess of the benefits to the property as shown by the report of the appraisers, as corrected, that will in any manner impair the security of bonds or the fund available for the payment of the principal or interest.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXIIc268s268.370ol13">
       When he receives the bonds the treasurer shall execute and deliver to the president of the board a bond with good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the board, conditioned that he shall account for and pay over as required by law and as ordered to do by the board all money received by him on the sale of any bonds, and that he will only sell and deliver the bonds to the purchaser of the bonds according to the terms of this section, and that he will return, duly canceled, any bonds not sold to the board when ordered by it to do so. This bond shall remain in the custody of the president of the board, who shall produce it for inspection or as evidence whenever legally required to do so. The bond of the treasurer may, if the board directs, be signed by a surety or bonding company, which may be approved by the board. The successor in office of any treasurer shall comply with all provisions applicable to his predecessor before receiving bonds or their proceeds. The treasurer shall promptly report all sales of bonds to the board.

       The board shall, at reasonable times, prepare and issue warrants for the payment of the maturing bonds sold and the interest payments coming due on all bonds sold. Each warrant shall specify what bonds and accruing interest it is to pay, and the treasurer shall place sufficient funds at the place of payment to pay the maturing bonds and coupons when due, as well as a reasonable compensation to the bank or trust company for paying them, not to exceed two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) for each one thousand dollars ($1,000) par value of bonds or coupons paid.

     <p>
      Any owner may use the drain as an outlet for lateral ditches from his land. If his land is separated from the drain by the land of another and they are unable to agree as to the conditions on which one may enter another’s land and construct the ditch, he may file his ancillary petition in the pending proceeding to the court, and secure condemnation as provided for in the Eminent Domain Act of Kentucky. When the ditch is constructed, it shall become a part of the drainage system and shall be under the control of the board and kept in repair by it.
