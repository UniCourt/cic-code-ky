      (3/30/90). The definition of
    “animal” contained in subsection (2) of this section does not
      reflect the amendatory language contained in Senate Bill 263 of the 1980 Regular
      Session of the Kentucky General Assembly because the 1980 Senate Journal indicates
      that Senate Bill 263 was vetoed by Governor John Y. Brown, Jr., on April 9,
      1980, and recommitted by action of the Senate to its Committee on Appropriations
      and Revenue on April 14, 1980. Senate Bill 263 proposed to change subsection
      (2) to read as follows: “‘Animal’ includes every warmblooded
      living creature except birds and human beings;”. By a letter dated March
      16, 1990, the Attorney General has informally opined that Governor Brown’s
      veto of Senate Bill 263 was not timely; that letter has exhibits showing that
      the bill was received by the Governor on March 28, 1980, and that his veto
      was received by the Senate Clerk on April 10, 1980.

        The department of finance could properly pay a state
        trooper and a matron both for returning a fugitive in accordance with appointment
        by the Governor although the statute authorizes payment to an agent in the
        singular, since under this section a word in the singular may be expanded
        to include the plural.

        Under a statute authorizing the Governor to appoint
        an agent to return a fugitive from another state, the Governor is authorized
        to appoint more than one (1) agent, since under this section a word importing
        the singular number only may extend and be applied to several persons or things.

        govern the procedure and practice in all courts of this state except where
        the procedure and practice are set out under special statutes, that this section
        is not a special statute, and that the time for appeal from the workers’ compensation

        If the basis of the action has been so completely
        consummated on the day of its commission or omission as to afford a right
        of action on that day, the day of its commission or omission must be included
        in the count; however, it may not be included in the count if the passing
        of the full day is a prerequisite to the determination that the cause of action
        has accrued. Preston v. Preston, 289

        Time is usually computed from an act done when there

        that will affect such act, be affected by it, or is in some manner dependent

        A will is sufficiently subscribed although the signatures
        of the attesting witnesses were separated by a small space from the signature
        of the testatrix, where such space was taken up by the words, “Signature,”
        “Witnesses sign here,” and “Sign here,” such words
        clearly explaining why the witnesses signed as they did. Ward v. Putnam, 119

        of that paragraph was printed in larger letters and darker ink than the balance
        of the contract, the defendant lessee was bound by the “terms and conditions,”

        Subsection (1) of this section did not abolish the
        doctrine of incorporation by reference; when the signature is in the middle
        of a writing, it gives no assurance that the contracting parties intend to
        be bound by matters which do not appear above their signatures; however, when
        a signature is placed after clear language has expressed the incorporation
        of other terms and conditions by reference, it is a logical inference that
        the signer agrees to be bound by everything incorporated. Bartelt Aviation, Inc. v. Dry Lake Coal Co., 682 S.W.2d 796, 1985

        Where the terms and conditions of sale, which contained

        also appeared below the signature line, those terms and conditions and the

        Students who signed a student enrollment agreement midway through the document were not bound by the arbitration provision on the reverse side of the agreement because the incorporating language found in the agreement did not clearly and unmistakably evince the parties' intent to submit questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator; the college's language was not clear enough to overcome statute and the requirement that parties show assent to be bound by terms of a contract.

        the remedy for its violation. Where the violated statute both declares the

        When the mother of a disabled child sued the estate of the child’s father regarding various statutory violations in the handling of the estate which allegedly resulted in denying the child the opportunity to present a child support claim against the estate, it was error to dismiss the complaint on summary judgment because Kentucky statutes were violated, presenting a genuine issue of material fact as to the child’s possible injury.

        Based upon the allegations contained in the complaint, it was clear that the insured asserted claims for more than late payments; in addition to seeking such payments, she alleged “bad conduct” on the part of the insurer under Kentucky’s Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act. While the court could not address the merit of such claims, at this stage of the proceedings, it concluded that the claims fell outside the limited holdings of the cases cited by the insurer and the insurer’s motion for judgment on the pleadings was denied.

        For purposes of an incitement to riot claim relating to a candidate's statement (“get 'em out of here”) at a campaign rally, it was not necessary to allege that a riot actual occurred. To the extent it was necessary to expressly allege the number of people involved or that there was tumult and violence, that requirement was satisfied by the allegation that the candidate directed supporters to eject peaceful protestors using harmful physical force and intended to create a public disturbance involving an assemblage of five or more persons which by tumultuous and violent conduct created grave danger of damage or injury.

        The intention of the legislature in enacting a law

        the historical setting surrounding its enactment; the public policy of the
        state, the condition of its laws, the habits and manners of its people, and
        all other prior and contemporaneous facts and circumstances that throw intelligent

        The mechanics’ and materialman’s liens statutes are
        to be construed according to their common and approved language and the courts
        take a liberal view toward promoting the legislative intent and they are to
        be interpreted liberally to protect those who furnish labor and materials. Bee Spring Lumber Co. v. Pucossi, 943 S.W.2d 622, 1997

        When the Kentucky Legislature pronounced
        in subsection (3) that laws should not be applied retroactively, it is presumed
        to have done so with the knowledge that this would be interpreted to apply
        to laws of substance only, and not those dealing strictly with the extent
        of remedy. Kentucky Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Jeffers, 13 S.W.3d 606, 2000

        The legislative will has to be determined by the
        meaning of the words of its enactment, and what it intended to do has to be
        determined from what it did do, giving to the former and later statutes the

        In search for the legislative will, the court starts
        with the pertinent conditions existing when the law was enacted, with their
        background and development, and looks toward the object sought to be accomplished.
        Those attendant circumstances, the context of the act and its consequences
        are controlling, even though it may be necessary to modify the language used
        in order to make it consistent. Green v. Moore, 281

        Where a statute has been construed by the courts,
        or by administrative officials, to have a certain meaning, and is subsequently
        reenacted in substantially the same terms, it will be presumed that the legislature
        was familiar with the construction and intended to adopt it as part of the
        law. Gilbert v. Greene, 185

        It is only where the language of the statute is of

        If a statute is manifestly intended to regulate the

        relating to the same subject, so far as it differs from them in its prescriptions. Head v. Commonwealth, 165

        The rule that the repeal of statutes by implication
        is not favored means that it is the duty of the court to construe the statutes,
        if possible, so that both will be operative, and if they can be read together
        without contradiction or absurdity they shall be read together and both given
        effect. Head v. Commonwealth, 165

        Where the provisions of two (2) statutes are not

        Courts will construe statutes if possible so that
        both old and new acts will be operative and effective if it can be done without
        contradiction or absurdity, and if any part of an existing law can be reconciled
        or harmonized with the provisions of a new law, it will not be deemed to have

        By its plain language, KRS 403.190(4) was to be read in conjunction, not in conflict with, KRS 161.700(2); a ruling that a husband in a divorce case was allowed to exclude the full amount of his Kentucky Teachers’
        Retirement System (KTRS) account from classification and division as marital property pursuant to KRS 161.700(2) was error because the wife’s SEP-IRA qualified as a retirement account under KRS 403.190(4), and, thus, the divisionary rules of KRS 403.190(4) limited the amount of KTRS funds that the husband was allowed to exclude.

        Although criminal statutes should be construed the
        same as civil statutes, yet laws which create crime should be sufficiently
        explicit that men subject to their penalties may know what acts are forbidden,
        and before a man can be punished his case must be plainly within the statute.
        Crime is not to arise upon doubtful construction of a statute where a person
        of ordinary intelligence, reading the statute, would not understand that the
        act was forbidden and criminal statutes are not to be extended beyond the
        fair and natural meaning of the words used. Commonwealth v. Adams Express Co., 123

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A penal statute must be sufficiently plain and exact
        to enable persons of ordinary intelligence to understand its provisions, and
        its mandate should be so clearly expressed that any ordinary person can determine
        what he may and may not do. Katzman v. Commonwealth, 140
        <cite class="ky_code">

       </p>
       <p>
        Every penal statute should be given a reasonable
        construction — one that will effectuate the legislative intent in its
        enactment; and if it describes the offense in language that can be understood
        by persons of ordinary intelligence, it will not be declared invalid on the
        ground of uncertainty for the established rules of construction do not require
        that the sufficiency of penal statutes be measured by a technical standard
        that would impair their efficiency and make their enforcement difficult or
        impossible. Katzman v. Commonwealth, 140
        <cite class="ky_code">

        Law does not favor penalties and will not exact them
        unless statute is clear and convincing, and, hence, if statute is so ambiguous
        as to leave reasonable minds in doubt, penalty will not be exacted beyond
        letter of statute. Commonwealth ex rel. Martin v. Tom Moore Distillery Co., 287

        Statutes are construed according to their meaning,
        rather than according to the letter. Words may be rejected when they are plainly
        useless and inappropriate and have no relation to the subject matter of the
        statute, and where it is plainly evident they were inserted by carelessness
        or inadvertence. Words may be read into a statute to prevent the statute from
        resulting in absurdity, and where they are plainly necessary to the legislative
        meaning and have been left out by carelessness or inadvertence. Collocation
        of words and phrases may be changed when the court is thoroughly convinced
        that the change is necessary to carry out the legislative will and to prevent
        an absurd conclusion or defeat the intention of the statute. Ross v. Board of Education, 196

        words or phrases are susceptible of two (2) meanings, depending upon the state
        of facts to which they are applied, the court may instruct the jury in the

        Order allowing the Commonwealth to amend to reduce a fourth-offense operating a motor vehicle under the influence (DUI) charge to a second-offense DUI in order to avoid impermissible double enhancements was error because defendant had refused to submit to an alcohol concentration test, and, thus, such a motion to amend was prohibited by KRS 189A.120(1); clearly, by moving to amend, the Commonwealth had improperly agreed to the amendment. Nothing in KRS 189A.120(1) led to the conclusion that the Commonwealth was only prohibited from concurring in a defense motion to amend while remaining free to seek such an amendment on its own.

        When words used in a penal statute have both a popular
        and a trade or technical meaning, and as used in the statute they have reference
        to a trade or profession, the words shall be given the meaning understood

        Even if a term such as “broadcasting”

        Employer was entitled to credit its liability for past due or future income benefits only to the extent that those benefits duplicated or overlapped workers’
        compensation benefits because KRS 342.730(6) did not entitle the employer to credit the overpayment of voluntary benefits against future income benefits; the Loss of License benefit to which the parties agreed exceeded the claimant’s benefit under KRS 342.730(1) during the weeks that they overlapped. The purpose of KRS 342.730(6) is to avoid a duplication of income-replacement benefits with respect to injuries that occur after its effective date by permitting private contractual benefits that duplicate benefits awarded under KRS 342.730(1) to offset them.

    Common and approved use of language permitted the trial court to determine that KRS 121A.080(11)’s (now repealed) express provision for replacement of a candidate in the event of the candidate’s “disqualification to hold the office sought” included as a “disqualification” a judicial decision declaring a candidate not to be bona fide, and, thus, the candidate was entitled to name a replacement as a new running made because the previous running made was “disqualified” as a bona fide candidate when the trial court determined that the previous running mate did not meet the residency requirement for being a bona fide candidate.

        § 234 requires all civil officers of Kentucky to reside in Kentucky;

        constitutional; thus the special notary, who lives in Kentucky, may, under
        KRS 423.110, engage in notarial acts in a foreign jurisdiction, provided that
        such exercise of functions does not violate the public policy of or is not
        in basic conflict with the law of the foreign jurisdiction.

        Trial court erred in voiding defendant’s pretrial diversion agreement and sentencing her under the prior law because, while the trial court had authority to void defendant’s plea agreement in its entirety, no judgment had been entered against her when she violated the terms of her pretrial diversion and faced sentencing, and the sentence recommended by the Commonwealth became inappropriate due to the 2010 change to the drug paraphernalia statute.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Kentucky Revised Statutes
    of 1942 are intended to speak for themselves, and all sections of the Kentucky
      Revised Statutes of 1942 shall be considered to speak as of the same date,
      except that in cases of conflict between two (2) or more sections or of a
      latent or patent ambiguity in a section, reference may be had to the Acts
      of the General Assembly from which the sections are indicated to have been
      derived, for the purpose of applying the rules of construction relating to
      repeal by implication or for the purpose of resolving the ambiguity. Like
      reference may be had to any special acts or charters granted by the General
      Assembly prior to the adoption of the present Constitution, for the like purpose.

        The act (Acts 1942, ch. 208) revising the statutes
        did not violate Const., § 51 for the different chapters and sections
        were germane and related to the one object of gathering together a unified
        system of law in a clarified and concise form for convenient use and division
        among separate acts would not only have been contrary to the spirit of the

        The courts may not resort to legislative history
        for the purpose of construing a statute where there can be no question as
        to the intent of the legislature, but where the literal meaning of a statute
        makes it a substantial departure from the long-established legislative policy
        on the subject, known to the court, the doubt thereby arising as to the legislative
        intent requires an examination of available information bearing on the purpose
        to be accomplished by the legislation in question. Swift v. Southeastern Greyhound Lines, 294
        <cite class="ky_code">

        The Kentucky Revised Statutes are controlling where
        the proceedings in question arose after the Kentucky Revised Statutes became
        effective, but the court may examine the historical setting of the revised
        sections to aid in their construction. Morgan v. Fayette County Board of Education, 294

        Where a subsection was ambiguous as it appeared in

        In the case of an ambiguity in the Kentucky Revised
        Statutes, the court may supply omitted words that were contained in the original

        Resort may not be had to the original acts from which
        the 1942 revision of the statutes was derived except in the case of an ambiguity
        in the revision. Ambiguity that will permit a reference to former statutes
        may exist on its face, or may develop when the statute is brought into contact
        with collateral facts, as where the consequences or results of a literal construction
        would be absurd or unreasonable, or may arise from a conflict between the
        provisions of one section and those of other sections in pari materia. Fidelity &amp; Columbia Trust Co. v. Meek, 294

        If a section of the Kentucky Revised Statutes, as

        legislative intent. Swift v. Southeastern Greyhound Lines, 294

        Where sections of the Kentucky Revised Statutes derived
        from earlier acts could be reconciled with sections enacted by separate acts
        in 1942, there was no need to apply this section. Cawood v. Coleman, 294

        In a case arising from plaintiff, a Muslim woman, allegedly being ordered to remove her headscarf for a booking photograph (taken by a male police officer), the Supreme Court held that the General Assembly did not waive sovereign immunity from suit under the Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act (KRFRA) as to monetary damages. Thus, plaintiff was limited to a potential declaratory judgment enjoining defendant if she could prove a violation of KRFRA.

        The act (Acts 1942, ch. 208) revising the statutes
        did not violate Const., § 51 for the different chapters and sections
        were germane and related to the one object of gathering together a unified
        system of law in a clarified and concise form for convenient use and division
        among separate acts would not only have been contrary to the spirit of the
        constitution but would also have been embarrassing to honest legislation. Fidelity &amp; Columbia Trust Co. v. Meek, 294

        The Kentucky Revised Statutes were enacted as the
        law of the Commonwealth and not merely adopted as a compilation and they repealed
        all former statutes; moreover the act revising the statutes is the law and
        not merely evidence of the law. Fidelity &amp; Columbia Trust Co. v. Meek, 294

        The Kentucky Revised Statutes are controlling where
        the proceedings in question arose after the Kentucky Revised Statutes became
        effective, but the court may examine the historical setting of the revised
        sections to aid in their construction. Morgan v. Fayette County Board of Education, 294
