        The power to appoint members of boards and agencies within the executive department of government is an essentially executive power which cannot be exercised by any member of the legislative department; accordingly, the provisions in this section by which the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tem of the Senate are authorized to make appointments to the State Fair Board are an invalid unconstitutional incursion by the General Assembly, or in this case, its designees, into the separation of powers doctrine.

Const., § 55, regardless of fact that new state fair board provided for by act would not be completely organized until three and one-half years later; therefore, the provision of the 1946 act creating the position of manager of the state fair became effective when the act took effect, and was not postponed until time of organization of new board.

       Members of the Kentucky state fair board and/or staff can be held personally liable under a negligence theory of law for accidents that occur at a facility under the state fair board’s control; moreover, without an enabling statute, no public funds can be expended to purchase liability insurance to cover the board members and staff.

      Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) contained
      an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the
      Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State
      on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st
      Ex. Sess.), provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89,
      and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred
      ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other
      subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other
      specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule
      is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for
      in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows:
      “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before
      April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act”
      = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date
      of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the
      effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within

      “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before

        As a consequence of the disparity between the numbers of eligible producers voting in successive referenda required to adopt and to terminate or discontinue the assessment program, the votes of those producers who favor the assessment program is accorded substantially greater weight than votes of those persons in the same class of producers who are opposed to the program; thus the terms and conditions of KRS 247.780(1) effectively operate to deny the producers of burley tobacco who are opposed to an assessment program the equal protection of the law required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and the same contravenes Ky. Const., §§ 3 and 59; said subsection of the act is, therefore, discriminatory and void. Tabor v. Council for Burley Tobacco, Inc., 599 S.W.2d 466, 1980

        As a consequence of the disparity between the numbers of eligible producers voting in successive referenda required to adopt and to terminate or discontinue the assessment program, the votes of those producers who favor the assessment program is accorded substantially greater weight than votes of those persons in the same class of producers who are opposed to the program; thus the terms and conditions of subsection (1) of this section effectively operate to deny the producers of burley tobacco who are opposed to an assessment program the equal protection of the law required by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and the same contravenes Ky. Const., §§ 3 and 59; said subsection of the act is, therefore, discriminatory and void. Tabor v. Council for Burley Tobacco, Inc., 599 S.W.2d 466, 1980

      </p>
      <p>
       Tobacco companies which deal directly with individual farmers by establishing prices at the farm and accepting delivery of tobacco at company facilities where the tobacco is weighed and paid for, are not subject to the Department of Agriculture’s jurisdiction as tobacco warehouses which must operate pursuant to the requirements of KRS Chapter 248, since the companies are not functioning as “warehousemen,” as defined in subsection (5) and their facilities are not “warehouses” as defined in subsection (4).

       The membership of each tobacco board of trade shall be divided into two (2) classes: active members and associate members. Any person, partnership, corporation or association operating a loose leaf auction warehouse or warehouses shall be eligible for active membership in the tobacco board of trade; provided, however, that each board of trade shall have the right to establish the basis of voting rights for its warehouse members according to floor space, ownership, number of separate warehouse buildings or otherwise. Any person, partnership, corporation or association not eligible for active membership but holding a tobacco dealer’s license and purchasing tobacco pursuant to said license upon the market governed by the tobacco board of trade shall be eligible for election as an associate member. Each associate member shall have the option of becoming, upon written notice to the tobacco board of trade, either a participating or a nonparticipating member. A nonparticipating member shall not have the right to vote upon any question coming before the tobacco board of trade.

      The Home Tobacco Warehouse Company, which owns four separate warehouses, clearly would be required under the terms of this section to pay a separate license fee of $250 for each warehouse building regardless of the fact that the company owns all four (4) buildings, and regardless of the fact that there may only be one general office, provided, of course, that tobacco is sold at each separate warehouse, but if some tobacco warehouse buildings are used solely for storing tobacco no license would be required for such buildings.

        In view of the fact that tobacco warehouses are public warehouses and in view of legislation which grants the department of agriculture power to license, supervise and regulate such warehouses, agents of the department are authorized to examine the records of tobacco warehouses.

        A warehouseman can offer such a service as lending money to tobacco growers only when such a service is extended to all those growers using his warehouse, and failure to do so violates this section.

        It would appear to be a violation of the anti-discrimination provisions of subsection (1) of this section for a tobacco warehouse to charge a lower commission to tobacco farmers who elect to sell their tobacco by the bale method than it charges to tobacco farmers who elect to sell their tobacco by the tied method since the general assembly has eliminated flexibility and precluded the utilization of reasonable classifications in connection with the sale of tobacco by tobacco warehouses.

      (3/20/2017).
    2017 Ky. Acts ch. 45 contained 13 sections. Sections 1 to 10 of that Act amended, repealed and reenacted, or created statutes relating to the industrial hemp research program found in the statutory range of
      KRS

      . The correct reference should have been to only Sections 1 to 10 of this Act, the relevant range affecting the industrial hemp research program, and in codification the Reviser of Statutes has codified that language in this statute accordingly under the authority of
      KRS 7.136(1)(h) to correct manifest clerical or typographical errors.

        Defendant’s convictions for manufacturing methamphetamine under KRS 218A.1432(1)(a) and anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine under KRS 250.489(1) did not violate double jeopardy because the former made no mention of anhydrous ammonia or what constituted a proper container for it; thus, on its face there was proof of an element required for a conviction of the latter offense that was not required for a conviction of the former. Further, while manufacturing methamphetamine required that the defendant acted in the past, proving that the defendant possessed the anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine in the future required proving how the defendant was going to act; thus, the two crimes did not constitute a “continuing course of conduct” and did not violate double jeopardy.

        Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction of possessing anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine because although the liquid anhydrous ammonia found in the freezer was not tested, the contents of the propane tank field-tested positive for anhydrous ammonia and a detective testified that the charge of possessing anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container was based on the anhydrous ammonia found in the propane tank, not the contents of the bowl found in the freezer. Furthermore, the fact that a manufacturing process was ongoing at the time of the search and that numerous other chemicals and items of equipment used in the manufacture of methamphetamine were found nearby, created a reasonable inference that defendant intended to use the anhydrous ammonia to manufacture methamphetamine.

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction of possession of anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine because KRS 250.482(3) applies the proscription in KRS 250.489(1) to anhydrous ammonia in either its compressed or liquefied form but not to aqueous ammonia, and an officer testified that based on his training and experience, the odor emanating from the liquid in the glass jar found in defendant’s residence was that of anhydrous ammonia, not diluted (aqueous) household ammonia.

       <p>
        KRS 250.991(2) refers to an enhanced penalty for a “subsequent offense” without defining it. In that circumstance, the Supreme Court of Kentucky has always interpreted such language to require a conviction-to-offense sequence, i.e., the second offense must occur after conviction of the first offense. The rationale behind this interpretation is that after punishment is imposed for the commission of a crime, the double penalty is held in terrorem over the criminal, for the purpose of effecting his reformation, and preventing further and subsequent offenses by him; the Supreme Court of Kentucky adopts this interpretation for subsequent offenses prosecuted under KRS 250.991(2).

The board or the department shall provide for the collection of the assessment, under the provisions of this section, for the purpose of financing the Kentucky grain insurance fund, which is hereby created. Assessments shall be levied only on fund-covered grains.

       Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, beginning on or after August 1, 2019, all persons in this state who are licensed grain dealers or licensed grain warehouse operators shall deduct the levied assessment from each producer’s payment for fund-covered grain. The total assessment collected by each licensee shall, on or before the fifteenth day of the month following the end of the month in which the grains are sold to the purchaser, be remitted to the grain insurance fund. The books and records shall clearly indicate the producer assessment and shall be open for inspection by the board or the department.

        In Chapter 12 case, brand placed on cattle by leasing party was not sufficient to establish ownership over party with security interest because brand was not registered and did not become part of state report until after bankruptcy petition was filed. In re Purdy, 2015 Bankr. LEXIS 2938 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. Sept. 2, 2015), aff'd, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107565 (W.D. Ky. Aug. 15, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankruptcy court properly concluded that a lessor did not own any of the cattle at the time of an auction because, all the cattle were delivered to the debtor, incorporated into his operation, were being fed, cared for, and producing milk before the lessor had signed a lease with the debtor, the leases at issue were found to be true leases, and the bankruptcy court did not violate the mandate rule by holding an evidentiary hearing to determine who owned the cattle that were auctioned, and, even if the lessor was correct as to the legal application of the branding statute, 289 out of 415 cattle bore two indicia of ownership at the time of the auction, which the bankruptcy court determined was inconclusive and “not probative” of ownership.

        , and these statutes make clear that the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the act; however KRS 24A.120(1), which provides a general grant of jurisdiction to the circuit court in civil matters, specifically excludes from the purview of the district court matters affecting title to real estate. As such, a district court erred in not only determining the rights and obligations of the parties under the Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act but in also determining the location of the boundary line itself because such a determination is clearly beyond the bounds of the district court’s subject matter jurisdiction.

        Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act consists of two substantive statutes, KRS

        , and these statutes make clear that the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the act; however KRS 24A.120(1), which provides a general grant of jurisdiction to the circuit court in civil matters, specifically excludes from the purview of the district court matters affecting title to real estate. As such, a district court erred in not only determining the rights and obligations of the parties under the Kentucky Boundary Line Fence Act but in also determining the location of the boundary line itself because such a determination is clearly beyond the bounds of the district court’s subject matter jurisdiction.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If any livestock enter into any land over or through a lawful fence, the owner or manager of the livestock shall for the first trespass be liable to the owner or occupant of that land for damages to his or her trees, grass, grain, crops, livestock or land as he or she may have sustained by the entry of the livestock, and for every subsequent trespass by the livestock of the same owner, double damages. After giving the owner or manager of the livestock at least five (5) days’ notice, in writing, of the fact of two (2) previous breaches into the same enclosure by the livestock of the same owner, the owner or occupant of the enclosure shall have a lien on the livestock to indemnify him or her on account of any damages sustained by the third or any subsequent trespasses of those livestock and may enforce his or her lien by action as in cases of a mortgage lien.

       Where a railroad company could reasonably anticipate that children would be upon its tracks, the railroad had a duty to prevent children from going upon the tracks and this duty could have been met either by stationing guardsmen at the place where children were entering the tracks, or by erecting a suitable fence; the law imposed such duty on the railroad, unless the cost of fulfilling that duty would have been unreasonable in relation to the risk involved.

       The state board of agriculture has authority to promulgate a regulation requiring any cattle owner of beef stock under quarantine to round up the herd with reasonable notice and at a specified time for the purpose of permitting a representative of the department to inspect the cattle individually for any violation of the quarantine.

       The state veterinarian and his representatives have the authority and power to proceed to inspect and test cattle, wherever found, for contagious or communicable disease and any person who refuses to permit such inspection or testing will be subject to prosecution under KRS 246.990(2), 257.990(1) or 257.990(10).

        Animal carcasses must be cremated, or boiled, or buried under three feet of earth. Any other method of disposal would be in violation of this section.

        Certain parties may experiment with the disposal of poultry carcasses by composting them. Since chickens are not animals under the definition of “animal,” the disposal of chicken carcasses are not subject to regulation under this section.

      (7/15/2010). A reference to the “Kentucky Horse Racing Authority” in subsection (9) of this section, as created by 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 106, sec. 1, has been changed in codification to the “Kentucky Horse Racing Commission” to reflect the reorganization of certain parts of the Executive Branch, as set forth in Executive Order 2009-535 and confirmed by the General Assembly in 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 24. This change was made by the Reviser of Statutes pursuant to 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 24, sec. 1938.
     </p>
     
     <p>
      (7/15/2010). The proposed Senate Committee Substitute to House Bill 398, which became 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 106, attached the text of Senate Bill 105/HCS to HB 398 and made several changes to the existing provisions, including the addition of paragraph (c) to subsection (9) of this statute. As drafted, paragraph (c) contained the phrase, “commission authorized under this Act.” After examination of the materials in the bill folder and consultation with the drafter, “this Act” was changed to “this chapter” during codification, as all sections of 2010 Ky. Acts ch. 106 are located in KRS Chapter 257. This substitution was made by the Reviser of Statutes under the authority of KRS 7.136(1)(f).

       The administration of rabies vaccines is the practice of veterinary medicine pursuant to KRS 321.181(5)(a). However, the legislature in its power to regulate the health and safety of its citizens has authorized in KRS
       <cite class="ocky">

       and subsection (4) of this section two limited exceptions granting certain individuals temporary permits to administer rabies shots to dogs.

       Since the law requires that all dogs over four months old be given a rabies vaccine administered by a veterinarian or a qualified person pursuant to this section and KRS

       and after the initial rabies vaccine, a dog must be re-vaccinated at the expiration of the immunization period as certified by the veterinarian. A dog owner is not exempted by virtue of KRS 321.200(1)(b) from the requirement that the dog must have a current rabies vaccination administered by either a veterinarian or other qualified person.

        in defining owner as any person who accepts custody of a dog, operated to insulate the legal owner from liability against another owner of the dog, the trial court properly entered judgment against the dog groomer who accepted the owner’s dog which later bit the groomer’s face.

        Parent of one of the dog owners, who was waiting by request at the owners’
        residence for an animal control officer to arrive and take the dog, was a statutory owner under KRS 258.095(5) when the parent saw the officer in a truck parked two blocks away from the owners’
        house, walked up to the truck with the dog, and motioned for the officer to get out of the truck. However, the officer did not become an owner of the dog for then getting out of the truck. Fetchko v. Morgan, 2008

        Landlords were the statutory owners under KRS 258.095(5) of a tenant’s dog for purposes of establishing liability under KRS 258.235(4) because the statute unambiguously stated that a person who permitted a dog to remain on the premises that he owned was deemed an owner for purposes of the dog-bite liability statute, and the landlords knew that the dog was on the leased premises, but did not take any affirmative steps to make sure the dog was removed from the property after revoking the tenant’s permission to keep it.

        Where ownership of a dog is premised on permission for the dog to remain on property, there must be an element of tenancy, even for a short period of time, in order to establish liability; therefore, liability would not extent to temporary excursions onto another’s property, even when done so with the landowner’s permission, for example when a dog entered a public park in which dogs were allowed.

        While there are no express statutory provisions in this section requiring the county dog warden to pick up dogs anywhere in the county, the fiscal court pursuant to its regulatory powers may require the dog warden to pick up such dogs that are unlicensed and loose upon the public way and if the dog warden has been so instructed by the fiscal court, the service should be supplied to the entire county and not just to unincorporated areas, particularly where the city or cities in the county do not have a dog ordinance.

        Counties may enact ordinances relative to dog control but whether they do or not, they must fulfill their statutory obligations as set forth in KRS Chapter 258. While cities have the authority to enact dog control measures they cannot impose obligations upon a county which the county does not agree to and which are in excess of the county’s duties and obligations under the provisions of KRS Chapter 258.

        The county has definite and prescribed obligations under KRS Chapter 258 but they do not include the duty to accept dogs at its pound picked up by municipal dog control authorities, particularly where violations of municipal ordinances are involved. While the cities and the county have the authority to enter into a joint or cooperative agreement concerning dog control and the use of the county dog pound, which could include a boarding fee for dogs delivered to the pound by city dog control officers, the cities, in the absence of an agreement with the county, cannot require the county to accept dogs picked up for violations of municipal ordinances; absent an agreement between the cities and the county relative to dog control, the cities will enforce their ordinances only, and the county and all peace officers will enforce the provisions of KRS Chapter 258.

        Neither this section nor any other section of KRS Chapter 258 makes a dog warden a peace officer and, therefore, he does not possess the powers of a peace officer; he could be made a peace officer by being appointed, for example, a deputy sheriff but such an appointment could not involve an increase in the number of deputy sheriff positions beyond the number established by the fiscal court pursuant to KRS

        County ordinance that banned the possession of pit bull terriers was not invalid. It was supplemental to, rather than inconsistent with, KRS ch. 258, which banned vicious dogs generally, since it did not limit the statute’s application but instead provided a more comprehensive plan of protection. Bess v. Bracken County Fiscal Court, 210 S.W.3d 177, 2006
        <cite class="ky_code">

        Partial summary judgment on the issue of strict liability under KRS 258.235(4) was proper for the mother of a child that was attacked by homeowners’
        dog while she was being watched by the homeowners in the pursuit of a day care business. The child was too young to be contributorily negligent, and no third party could be implicated for liability. May v. Holzknecht, 320 S.W.3d 123, 2010

        Because former KRS 258.275(1) (now see KRS 258.235(4)) did not impose strict liability upon the owner or keeper of a dog, and the trial court instructed the jury consistent with the holdings of other cases that the dog owner had to have had reason to believe the injured person would be in the vicinity of the animal, there was no error in the trial court’s instructions as to the dog owner’s duties. Carmical v. Bullock, 251 S.W.3d 324, 2007

        Landlords were the statutory owners under KRS 258.235(4) of a tenant’s dog for purposes of establishing liability under KRS 258.095(5) because the statute unambiguously stated that a person who permitted a dog to remain on the premises that he owned was deemed an owner for purposes of the dog-bite liability statute, and the landlords knew that the dog was on the leased premises, but did not take any affirmative steps to make sure the dog was removed from the property after revoking the tenant’s permission to keep it. Benningfield v. Zinsmeister, 367 S.W.3d 561, 2012
        <cite class="ky_code">

       <p>
        Although landlords were the statutory owners under KRS 258.235(4) of a tenant’s dog, they were not liable under KRS 258.095(5) for injuries a minor sustained when attacked by the dog because the dog attack occurred off the premises, and liability could only arise for attacks occurring on or about the premises. Benningfield v. Zinsmeister, 367 S.W.3d 561, 2012

        Where ownership of a dog is premised on permission for the dog to remain on property, there must be an element of tenancy, even for a short period of time, in order to establish liability; therefore, liability would not extent to temporary excursions onto another’s property, even when done so with the landowner’s permission, for example when a dog entered a public park in which dogs were allowed. Benningfield v. Zinsmeister, 367 S.W.3d 561, 2012

        Trial court properly instructed the jury to determine a dog owner's liability under a negligence standard because the proper inquiry was whether the owner had reason to anticipate the victim's presence or whether he failed to exercise ordinary care in controlling the dogs for the safety of others.

        City ordinance that provided that dogs must be chained or secured between sunset and sunrise to prevent them running at large and that owners must keep their dogs under their personal control at all times to prevent them from trespassing on and destroying and damaging property is a valid ordinance and complies with the State dog law and the terms of this section.

        If a city has an ordinance regulating dogs under the authority of this section, it could enter into a contract with the humane society for the establishment and joint operation of a dog pound within or without the city, or at least a contract for its use upon construction, and appropriate public funds for such purpose.

        After plaintiffs established that their automobile ran into a cow on the public highway and that defendant owned the cow, the defendant is required to come forward with the facts of how the cow got loose or permit the plaintiff’s prima facie case to go to the jury. Ellington v. Strader, 285 S.W.2d 497, 1955
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 81

        ).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a person is damaged by an animal at large, the plaintiff has made a prima facie case by proving the accident and the defendant’s ownership or control. Campbell v. White, 357 S.W.2d 849, 1962
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 146

        The unexplained presence of a cow on a highway creates against the owner a rebuttable presumption of negligence. Sparks v. Doe, 379 S.W.2d 252, 1964

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence of the owner of the cattle presented to the jury a question of credibility as to whether or not he had inspected the fence and whether it was in rotten condition at a time prior to the accident when he either knew about it or should have known about it and should have repaired it, the question of the owner’s negligence was properly submitted to the jury. Oliver Trucking Co. v. Harris, 441 S.W.2d 775, 1969

       <p>
        The unexplained presence of livestock on the highway creates against the owner or custodian of the livestock a rebuttable presumption of negligence which will entitle an injured plaintiff to a directed verdict as to the defendant’s negligence unless the animal’s keeper adduces rebutting evidence on that issue.

        Where the plaintiff presented evidence that a pony and a mule owned by the defendant were turned into a pasture but were on the adjoining road when the plaintiff hit the mule, such proof made out a prima facie case against the defendant.

        Where animals owned by the defendant were on a road without explanation of how they got there although they might have gotten there by several means, it was not within the ambit of forbidden speculation for the jury to find that the animals escaped by reason of the defendant’s failure to exercise ordinary care to prevent their escape.

        Where cattle are roaming over a road which is not a county road, the owner of the cattle claims fee simple ownership of the road, and the cattle are contained on the landowner’s premises, including the road, by means of cattle guards, whether this section has been violated or not depends on the status of the road. If it is in fact the private property of the cattle’s owner, there is no violation; on the other hand, if the road has attained the status of a public road, then the other property owners along the road may have a cause of action.

        Section 1. Statement of purpose, findings, and declaration of policy.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The purpose of this compact is to recognize the interstate character of the southern dairy industry and the prerogative of the states under the United States Constitution to form an interstate commission for the southern region. The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the South, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.
       </p>
       <p>
        The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is an essential agricultural activity of the South. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors, and retailers, are an integral component of the region’s economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential, and they are an integral part of the region’s rural communities. The farms preserve land for agricultural purposes and provide needed economic stimuli for rural communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price that southern dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the southern dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recent dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the southern dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action had been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The system of federal orders, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum prices paid to producers for raw milk, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established.
       </p>
       <p>
        In today’s regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual, state action is needed to more effectively address the market disarray. Under our constitutional system, properly authorized states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.
       </p>
       <p>
        In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region’s fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the system of federal orders nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the system of federal orders be discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission may regulate the marketplace in lieu of the system of federal orders. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the system of federal orders.

     Purpose of soil and water conservation district — Methods of achieving purpose.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of a soil and water conservation district is to conserve and develop all renewable natural resources within the district. In so doing, the district is authorized to undertake, sponsor, or participate in projects and activities which promote the conservation, development, maintenance and use of the land, water, trees and other renewable natural resources of the district. Such projects and activities shall include but not be limited to conservation practices on agricultural lands, the control of soil erosion, retardation of water runoff, the construction of flood prevention and control reservoirs, the maintenance of flood plains, the promotion of projects to assure an adequate municipal, industrial and agricultural supply of water, watershed stabilization, the avoidance and abatement of sedimentation and pollution in streams and other bodies of water, forestation and reforestation, the establishment of parks and outdoor recreation areas, the protection of open space, greenbelt areas and scenery, the preservation of wilderness areas, the protection of fish and wildlife, working for the location of highways, industries, housing developments, airports and other structures as are consistent with the district’s objectives and will offer the least possible interference with the conservation and best multiple use of the renewable natural resources, and all other activities consistent with the total natural resources development of the district.

      A member of the board of supervisors of a conservation district is a local, subdivisional officer and may potentially receive per diem and expenses for serving as such and a state officer could not hold the supervisor’s position because of the prohibition of KRS 61.080(1) and Ky. Const., § 165, but were he not a state officer but a state employee the dual positions would not violate these sections; however, since a member of the board of supervisors receives a per diem it constitutes a paid public office and a person serving as both a member of the board of supervisors and as a state officer or employee would be in violation of KRS 18.310(4) (now

        A watershed conservancy district is not a branch or instrumentality of state government so as to require it to proceed through the Department of Finance in all condemnation suits, pursuant to KRS 416.560(3); KRS 416.560(3) is applicable to agencies of the state which are under the direct supervision and control of the executive branch of state government.

        A district may condemn land for projects built without federal aid, and it was not necessary for the trial court to join any federal officials or to make a final determination on condemnee’s allegations concerning federal law where federal funds had not yet been made available to district, since it was irrelevant at that time whether the benefits outweighed the cost under the federal formula or whether the environmental impact statement then existed.

        A watershed conservancy district, with its defined though limited powers of government, including the authority to tax, borrow money, issue bonds, purchase land and construct necessary structures, is a separate entity and not a department, instrumentality or agency of a city or county or of the commonwealth in the sense contemplated by KRS 416.560(1), (2) and (3). A watershed conservancy district may, therefore, initiate condemnation proceedings on its own behalf, since KRS 416.560(1), (2) and (3) have no application, assuming, of course, that the watershed conservancy district has received prior approval from the Board of Supervisors of the soil conservation district pursuant to KRS

      is administratively practicable and feasible. To assist the board of supervisors in this determination, the board shall, within a reasonable time after entry of the finding that there is need for the organization of the district and the determination of the boundaries of the district, hold a referendum within the conservation district upon the proposition of the creation of the district to identify boundaries and give notification of funding options. Due notice of the referendum shall be given as provided in KRS 262.010(4). Such notice shall state the date of holding the referendum, the hours of opening and closing the polls, and shall designate one or more places within the proposed district as polling places. The board shall appoint a polling superintendent and other necessary polling officers giving equal representation to the proponents and opponents of the question involved.

       A watershed conservancy district, with its defined though limited powers of government, including the authority to tax, borrow money, issue bonds, purchase land and construct necessary structures, is a separate entity and not a department, instrumentality or agency of a city or county or of the commonwealth in the sense contemplated by KRS 416.560(1), (2) and (3). A watershed conservancy district may, therefore, initiate condemnation proceedings on its own behalf, since KRS 416.560(1), (2) and (3) have no application, assuming, of course, that the watershed conservancy district has received prior approval from the Board of Supervisors of the soil conservation district pursuant to this section.

       The board of directors of a watershed conservancy district could apply to the fiscal court of the county for the necessary easement or flowage right to permit the flooding from time to time, at very infrequent times of heavy rains, of a certain portion of a county road and the fiscal court had the authority to execute an instrument of easement or flowage right covering such situation, as applicable to the specifically designated right-of-way of the subject county road. Moreover, in view of the authority and responsibility of the watershed conservancy district under subsection (2) of this section, such district would be required to acquire the easement or flowage right, or otherwise, necessary when private property holders’ lands would be likewise flooded in such situation.

The annual rate of such assessments shall be fixed when other taxes of the district are levied and shall be sufficient in each year to provide for the payment of such bonds and interest coupons as they mature and sufficient to provide a fund equal to twenty percent (20%) of the average annual principal and interest requirements, the same to constitute a “debt service reserve” as a precaution against possible default by failure to collect annual levies.

       If there has been a general enhancement of values in the district by reason of watershed improvement projects, this can be a sufficient basis for the board of supervisors to determine that the land in question is benefited and should not be detached from the district.

       So long as real property that is allegedly not benefited remains within the area of the watershed conservancy district and is not detached pursuant to this section, the board of directors must levy the annual tax on the property at an equal rate with all other real property within the district.

     Acquisition of agricultural conservation easements by Commonwealth.

      <li id="tXXIc262-agriculturalconservationeasementss262.904ol11">
       The Commonwealth is hereby authorized to acquire agricultural conservation easements or other property interests. The property interest acquired may be any less-than-fee-simple interest, including an easement, life estate, covenant, or other contractual right. Acquisition may be accomplished by purchase, gift, grant, bequest, devise, covenant, or contract but only at a price that is equal to or less than the appraised value as provided in this section. The Commonwealth shall purchase these property interests only upon voluntary application of the landowner.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXIc262-agriculturalconservationeasementss262.904ol12">
       If the landowner so elects, the Commonwealth is authorized to pay the purchase price in a lump-sum single payment at the time of closing, to enter into contracts for pay outs over a term of years against the purchase price, or to enter into installment purchase agreements. When pay outs over time are made, the Commonwealth is authorized to pay interest consistent with prevailing market conditions at the time of the execution of the contract.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXIc262-agriculturalconservationeasementss262.904ol13">
       The interest which the Commonwealth owns in property other than eligible lands may be exchanged for property interests in eligible lands on an equivalent appraised value basis. If the property exchanged is not exactly equal in appraised value, cash payments may be made to provide net equivalent value in the exchange.
      </li>
      <li id="tXXIc262-agriculturalconservationeasementss262.904ol14">
       After the Commonwealth acquires an agricultural conservation easement or some property interest less than full ownership in any eligible land, the Commonwealth may purchase the remaining agricultural rights or other property interest in the land when the acquisition is necessary to maintain the agricultural uses of the property.
