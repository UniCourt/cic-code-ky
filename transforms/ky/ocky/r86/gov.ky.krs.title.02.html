        Since the population deviations resulting from reapportionment law were in violation of the “one man one vote” principle and did not measure up to the “as nearly as practicable” standard, and since the reason for these deviations — that district’s population would equalize itself in future — was not acceptable unless such a prediction could be made with a high degree of accuracy and unless similar predictions were made for every other district in the state, such reapportionment law was unconstitutional.

        A 1963 act which divided the existing thirteenth senatorial district into two districts whereby Fayette County which had comprised the original thirteenth district was divided into the twelfth and thirteenth did not create a new twelfth district but merely changed the geographic boundaries of that district.

        Since the population deviations resulting from reapportionment law were in violation of the “one man one vote” principle and did not measure up to the “as nearly as practicable” standard, and since the reason for these deviations — that district’s population would equalize itself in future — was not acceptable unless such a prediction could be made with a high degree of accuracy and unless similar predictions were made for every other district in the state, such reapportionment law was unconstitutional.

      In commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the resolution which passed through the 84th United States Congress and subsequently was signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on July 30, 1956, thereby making “In God We Trust” the national motto of the United States, the General Assembly hereby directs the Legislative Research Commission to display the national motto “In God We Trust” on the wall directly above and behind the dais of the Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives. The display shall be consistent with the historic and patriotic display of the national motto located directly above and behind the dais of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

      (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky. Acts ch. 107), did not comply with the three-readings rule of Kentucky Constitution Section 46 and that the legislation is, therefore, constitutionally invalid and declared void. That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.

      (7/14/2018). This statute was amended by 2018 Ky. Acts chs. 107, 171, and 207, which do not appear to be in conflict and have been codified together.

Service credit awarded as provided in this subsection shall be equivalent, for all purposes of the Legislators’ Retirement Plan, to other service credit earned in the plan. The service in the military reserves or the National Guard shall be treated as service earned prior to participation in the plan. The purchase can be made by the member by transfer, if authorized under subsection (7)(d) of this section, or in a lump-sum payment or by installment payments, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this subsection. The payment shall not be picked up by the employer as provided in KRS 6.505(4).

      (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky. Acts ch. 107), did not comply with the three-readings rule of Kentucky Constitution Section 46 and that the legislation is, therefore, constitutionally invalid and declared void. That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.

        Retirement Plan (LRP) and no longer contributed, his inviolable contract right was in place for purposes of Kentucky’s funding his defined benefit under the LRP; thus, he was entitled to receive retirement benefits based on an assumed salary of $27,500.

      Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

      The proper operation of democratic government requires that a public official be independent and impartial; that government policy and decisions be made through the established processes of government; that a public official not use public office to obtain private benefits; that a public official avoid action which creates the appearance of using public office to obtain a benefit; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government and public officials.

        The purpose and function of the Kentucky Code of Legislative Ethics and the Executive Branch Code of Ethics is not to restrict or prohibit appropriate and protected communications of the lobbyists; instead, the Commonwealth’s compelling interest in insuring the proper operation of a democratic government and deterring corruption is protected by these narrowly tailored sections, which require only that one who receives compensation and/or expends funds in lobbying must register and report the nature and extent of his activities.

        Since the gift ban provision was content neutral, it was subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny; the Commonwealth demonstrated that the gift ban advanced its anticorruption interest and employed means closely drawn to do so, and therefore survived closely drawn review.

        The need to properly identify and regulate compensated lobbyist groups in order to preserve and maintain the integrity of government constitutes a compelling state interest, which validates this classification and does not violate the lobbyist groups’ equal protection rights. Associated Indus. v. Commonwealth, 912 S.W.2d 947, 1995
        <cite class="ky_code">
         Ky. LEXIS 147

        Exception permitted associations and facilitated speech between lobbyists and legislators without undercutting Kentucky’s stated interest or abridging associational freedoms; through this carve out, Kentucky encouraged interactions that were less likely to raise concerns about actual or apparent corruption. Schickel v. Dilger, 925 F.3d 858, 2019 FED App. 110P, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 16116 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 649, 205 L. Ed. 2d 388, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 7298 (U.S. 2019).

        Catch-all provision was not void for vagueness because a person of ordinary intelligence would know that this language, used in both legal and common parlance, barred them from accepting or soliciting money or a gift that served as payment for a service provided; and the additional phrase “or the primary significance of which is economic gain” did not muddy the waters. Schickel v. Dilger, 925 F.3d 858, 2019 FED App. 110P, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 16116 (6th Cir. Ky.), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 649, 205 L. Ed. 2d 388, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 7298 (U.S. 2019).

      Enact. Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), ch. 4, § 37, effective September 16, 1993; 1996, ch. 211, § 2, effective July 15, 1996.

       Opinions of Attorney General.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

      Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

      Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

        Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

The provisions of this subsection notwithstanding, a legislator may vote on legislation affecting his salary, expenses, benefits, and allowances, as provided by law. The provisions of this subsection notwithstanding, a legislator may participate in the discussion of the question in committee and on the floor of the General Assembly, vote, or make a decision on a matter if any benefit or detriment which accrues to the member of the General Assembly, as a member of a business, profession, occupation, or other group, or to a member of his family or a business interest specified in subsection (1)(b) of this section is of no greater extent than the benefit or detriment which accrues generally to other members of the business, profession, occupation, or other group;

A member shall disclose his interest by filing a disclosure statement with the clerk or by a verbal announcement to the body.

       Since an attorney’s representation of a state college is of the nature of an independent contractor, no conflict of interest would exist by reason of the attorney’s serving as a member of the state legislature while at the same time representing the college in legal matters.

        While this ban dispensed with one means a legislator had to gather funds, it left open others less susceptible to the same risk of corruption or its appearance, and thus survived closely drawn scrutiny.

        Because this provision did nothing more than recognize that lobbyists and their employers and narrowly-defined PACs were paid to persuade legislators, not to purchase them, and that contributions made by these power players during an active session were particularly likely to give rise to the appearance of corruption, this time-limited ban was closely drawn.

      Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

        Since Chapter 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.), contained an emergency clause [§ 92] it became effective as a whole when the Governor tendered the bill, which he had signed, to the Secretary of State on February 18, 1993. However, section 87 (13) of Ch. 4 of Acts 1993 (1st Ex. Sess.) provided that, except as provided in §§ 88, 89, and 90, §§ 1-84 of the Act should become effective two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the Act, September 16, 1993; other subsections within § 87 establish a transition schedule with other specific dates calculated from the effective date of the Act. Such schedule is actually a listing of deadlines within which certain actions called for in § 87 of the Act are to be completed. Such schedule is as follows: “within 45 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 5, 1993; “within 60 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before April 19, 1993; “within 75 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 4, 1993; “within 90 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before May 19, 1993; “within 150 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before July 19, 1993; “within 180 days of the effective date of the act” = on or before August 17, 1993; “two hundred ten (210) days after the effective date of the act” = September 16, 1993.

      Although the psychiatric and psychological evaluations found in an inmate’s parole review file are confidential, caution should be exercised upon any examination thereof; the Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee and its staff may have access to the files, but should protect against the general release or publication of the material. Public discussion of this review should scrupulously avoid identification of individual inmates and the opinions expressed in the evaluations with respect to each of them.

      , advised the Reviser of Statutes of his determination “that no funds appropriated by the Executive Branch Appropriations Act for the 1995-96 biennium can be identified as having been appropriated for the purpose of implementing Sections 1 to 7 of House Bill No. 616, Chapter (296), Acts of the 1994 Regular Session of the General Assembly.” Accordingly, the amendment to this statute contained in 1994 Ky. Acts ch. 296 is void under sec. 3(8) of that Act and has not been codified into the statute.

       If there is school board opposition to school based decision making (SBDM) the SBDM council could seek assistance from the Office of Education Accountability and if they cannot assist the council, then legal action should be considered to force the school board to comply with the statute; however, that should not be necessary once the statute contains protections within it.

       Based on the language of Ky. Const., § 183 and on case law interpreting this section, the General Assembly has authorization to create the Office of Education Accountability.

       Superintendents and boards are subject to investigation by legislative agencies, but those agencies, in this case the Office of Education Accountability, may not take enforcement action against them.

       The discovery powers set forth in subsection (2)(d) (now (2)(e)) of this section are broad; however, they relate to the ability of the arm of the legislature to study the implementation of the Reform Act, and to insure that the General Assembly is successful in creating an “efficient system of common schools,” as mandated by Ky. Const., § 183.

       While the Office of Education Accountability does not have the right to perform the executive functions of regulating and supervising administration of the day to day operations of school districts, the office may study and monitor the implementation of the Kentucky Education Reform Act.

       Subsection (3) vests virtually unfettered discretion in the Office of Education Accountability to withhold records relating to its duties and responsibilities while an investigation is pending, and after it has concluded; the urgency and importance of this provision is further underscored by the fact that in 1992, the General Assembly elected to make it retroactive to July 13, 1990, and to include an emergency clause making it effective upon passage by the Governor; thus, a teacher’s request to have full access to records pertaining to a complaint filed against her was properly denied. OAG 98-ORD-149.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Office of Education Accountability properly denied a request for access to intra-office memorandum and the identity of an informant, which related to the requester’s attempt to hack into or invade the agency’s computer system. OAG 99-ORD-96.

       The Office of Education Accountability cannot prosecute a case to have an executive branch employee disciplined or removed for violation of subsection (9)(a).

      (12/13/2018). On December 13, 2018, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the passage of 2018 SB 151 (2018 Ky.

That ruling applies to changes made to this statute in that Act.

       The growing complexity and interdependence of the modern world, demonstrated by such issues as global environmental change, changing workforce development needs, the aging population, international trade, the number of working poor, the need for improved access to health care, and the emergence of fundamental changes in the role of government, require that government decision-makers consider the long-term changes affecting the welfare of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and bring these factors to bear upon public policy;

      <li id="tIIc7Bs7B.010ol12">

      <li id="tIIc7Bs7B.010ol13">
       To effect a prosperous future for the Commonwealth and its citizens, it is necessary for changes to occur in the way decisions are made in government so policymakers can consider the long-term implications of decisions and address emerging issues so the Commonwealth can take advantage of opportunities, avoid problems, and provide for continuity in policy; and
      </li>
      <li id="tIIc7Bs7B.010ol14">
       It is necessary to establish mechanisms to bring all perspectives into the decision-making process to evaluate information, focus attention on areas in which information is inadequate, and identify critical trends and alternative futures based upon the best available information.
